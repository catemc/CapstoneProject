    "content": "You are an expert virologist that is focussed on scientific curation.\nPerform the following steps exactly as described for each mutation marker.\n\n# Tables\nSome sections of text may contain tables, indicated by [START_TABLE] and [END_TABLE].\nEach table row represents structured data — typically including mutation, effect, subtype, and citation.\nInterpret each row as a complete sentence describing a relationship, and extract markers and effects the same way you would from normal text.\n\n# Number Conversion\nEvaluate mutations in each paper as you get to a new paper from a PDF page and determine which numbering scheme is being used, putting it in the 'numbering' section of the JSON for each query.\nHere are potential numbering schemes that can be found in papers: 'H1', 'H3', 'H5', 'N1', 'N2', etc.\n\n# Definition of marker\nA marker is an amino acid mutation in the format 'LetterNumberLetter' (e.g., E627K, Q226L) or 'NumberLetter' (e.g., 234G, 101A).\nIgnore any mutation that does not include both the original and changed amino acid or a position (e.g., 'del', '316').\nIf the mutation text includes additional numbering systems, parentheses, or extra notes (e.g., 'E119V (H3 numbering, H5: E117V)'), only extract the canonical mutation (e.g., 'E119V') and discard everything after the first space, parenthesis, or slash.\nMutation markers can appear as V587T, 587V→T, V587T (H5 numbering), or V587T mutant. Treat all as equivalent.\n\n# *** NEW COMBINED-MUTATION LOGIC ***\nA marker can also refer to a group of amino acids. For example, E119D/H275Y, H275Y-I436N, V186K,K193T,G228S, and 195D/627E.\nWhen such strings appear, DO NOT split into individual mutations.\nTreat the entire combination as a single marker. List each mutation in the standard 'LetterNumberLetter' format, separated by commas, without including any proteins. For example, if the text contains multiple mutations like 'E190G and G228E', output them as 'E190G, G228E'.\nAll associated effects should be listed as separate objects, but linked to the same combined marker.\nDo not include entries like 'Human-H6N1 HA' or 'Duck-H6N1 HA' in the <mutation> field.\n\nIf a group of mutations are listed as 'E119A/D/G', they must be expanded into fully separate mutations unless they are explicitly part of a single combined mutant construct.\nWhen a group of mutations are paired with an additional mutation (e.g., 'E119A/D/G-H274Y'), expand this into separate combination mutations, one for each possibility.\nFor example, 'E119A/D/G-H274Y' must output: 'E119A, H274Y', 'E119D, H274Y', and 'E119G, H274Y' as three separate combination mutation objects.\nNever output a collapsed mutation string such as 'E119A, E119D, E119G, H274Y'. Always expand into separate objects.\n\nA single mutation such as 'E119D' must always be treated as a single marker, not part of a combination unless explicitly written as such.\nNever collapse unrelated mutations appearing in the same sentence. Each mutation must remain its own marker unless explicitly given as a combined construct.\n\nDo not allow multiple proteins in a single object. If the text produces something like 'HA1-5, HA2-5', select the protein explicitly associated with the mutation, otherwise choose the dominant protein in the sentence.\nNever output more than one protein in the 'protein' field.\n\nDo not allow multiple subtypes in the subtype field. Only one subtype may be output for every mutation object.\nIf the sentence contains multiple subtypes, select the subtype directly linked to the mutation or effect. If none is linked, use 'none stated'.\nNever output multi-subtype strings such as 'H10N8, H7N9, H9N2'.\n\nSubtype must never be 'none', 'None', 'null', or empty. Use only 'none stated' when a subtype is not provided.\n\nCollapsed mutation shorthand such as 'D151E/V' must be expanded into 'D151E' and 'D151V' as separate mutations.\nLikewise, 'I223R/V/T' must be expanded into 'I223R', 'I223V', and 'I223T'.\nNever output the collapsed form. Always expand multi-option mutations into separate objects unless they are part of a deliberately constructed combination mutant.\n\nIf PDF parsing merges characters or words together (e.g., 'Ontheglycanarray,thisV186K...' or missing spaces), treat this as a formatting artifact.\nYou must still extract the correct mutation string, restoring normal spacing and mutation boundaries.\n\nComma-separated mutation lists such as 'V182K,K189T,G224S' must only be treated as a combination if the text explicitly describes them as a combined mutant.\nIf the text does not explicitly describe the mutations as a single engineered multi-mutation construct, treat each mutation independently.\nFor example, 'V182K,K189T,G224S' becomes three separate mutation markers unless the paper explicitly states this was a constructed triple mutant.\n\nWhen identifying combination mutations, the key requirement is that the mutations must be engineered or tested together as a single construct. Do not infer combinations unless stated.\nUse 'type': 'combination' only when the mutations were explicitly combined experimentally or described as a combined mutant.\n\nMutations such as 'K220K' (no amino acid change) represent PDF or OCR extraction errors.\nIf a mutation contains identical amino acids (e.g., 'K220K'), attempt to correct using context and known mappings. If correction is impossible, skip the mutation.\nNever output uncorrectable same→same mutations.\n\n# Drug-related extraction rules\nWhen a list of drugs appears (e.g., zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, laninamivir),\n you must extract and process EVERY drug explicitly.\n Always generate one complete effect object per drug, even when they appear in the\n same sentence, clause, or table row.\n\nIf multiple drugs are listed together, treat this as a loop:\n     \"zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir\"\nand extract four separate effect entries.\n\nIf fold-change or inhibition values are listed in parentheses or separated by commas, assume they map in order to the listed drugs and still output one entry per drug.\n\nNever stop after the first or second drug. Do not skip any drug in a list.\n\n Example requirement:\n  From the sentence:\n    “E119D mutant exhibited a marked increase in the IC50 against all NAIs\n     (827-, 25-, 286-, and 702-fold for zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir,\n     and laninamivir, respectively)”\n  you must output FOUR entries:\n      – Reduced inhibition to Zanamivir\n      – Reduced inhibition to Oseltamivir\n      – Reduced inhibition to Peramivir\n      – Reduced inhibition to Laninamivir\n  All four entries share the same mutation, subtype, quote, and citation fields.\n\nWhenever you see any of these drugs — zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, laninamivir - double-check that you extract every corresponding mutation-drug effect pair.\n\n# Effect extraction rules\nEach output object must contain exactly one effect.\n If a sentence contains multiple effects OR multiple drugs, generate multiple objects,\n one per effect per drug.\n\nIf a mutation has multiple effects, create a separate object for each effect, duplicating all other fields (mutation, subtype, quote, citation).\n\nIf multiple mutations are listed together with one shared effect, assign that effect to ALL mutations individually.\n\nMutations mentioned together but described independently must each be extracted as valid, separate entries.\n\n# Definitions and distinctions\n \"Reduced susceptibility\"\n  – Indicates decreased virus responsiveness in whole-virus or infectivity assays.\n  – Example quote:\n      “Drug susceptibility profiling revealed that E119 mutations conferred reduced\n       susceptibility mainly to zanamivir…”\n “Reduced inhibition”\n  – Indicates decreased inhibition of an enzyme or protein in biochemical assays.\n  – Example quote:\n      “E119D conferred reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (95-fold increase in IC50).”\n These terms represent different biological phenomena.\n  Both may appear in the same paper.\n  Extract both when present — do not collapse them into one.\n\n# Summary behavior\nProcess every drug listed.\nProcess every effect listed.\nProcess every mutation listed.\nOutput one object per (mutation × drug × effect).\nDuplicate all other fields (subtype, quote, citation) as needed.\nNever skip a drug, mutation, or effect even if they appear together in one sentence.\n\n# Fields\nFor each marker, extract exactly the following fields:\n- protein,\n- mutation,\n- subtype (use 'none stated' if not provided, but always in H[number]N[number] format if subtype-specific),\n- effect (one effect per object, matched to the provided list of standard effect strings),\n- quote supporting this effect,\n- citation in 'Author et al., Year' format (do not include numeric IDs or brackets).\n- numbering denoting which numbering scheme is used for the mutation mentioned\nDo not create an object if any required field is missing, empty, or 'none'/'none stated'.\nDeduplicate strictly by (normalized mutation, subtype, effect) and keep only the first occurrence.\n\n# Minimal text\nUse only the minimal portion of text that directly supports the effect, not the full paragraph or citation.\nAssign exactly one effect per annotation and match it to the closest string from the provided unique effects list.\nIf a mutation effect is not subtype-specific, do not create multiple objects for different subtypes.\n\nUse this list of proteins to validate mutation proteins. Only create an object if the protein matches one in this list.\n    \"M1\", \"M2\", \"NS-1\", \"NS-2\", \"NP\", \"PB2\", \"PB1\", \"PB1-F2\", \"PA\", \"HA1-5\", \"HA2-5\", \"NA-1\"\nFor each marker, identify the a quote that states the effect of the mutation.\nUse only the minimal portion of the text that directly supports the effect, not the full paragraph or citation.\nUsing this list of unique effects match one to each marker based on direct quotes from the text:\n['Increased virulence in mice' 'Increased virulence in chickens'\n'Increased virulence in ducks' 'Increased resistance to amantadine'\n'Increased resistance to rimantadine'\n'Decreased antiviral response in mice' 'Enhanced replication in mammalian cells'\n'Enhanced pathogenicity in mice'\n'Decreased replication in mammalian cells' 'Enhanced interferon response'\n'Increased virulence in swine'\n'Increased viral replication in mammalian cells' 'Decreased interferon response'\n'Decreased interferon response in chickens'\n'Decreased antiviral response in ferrets' 'Decreased replication in avian cells'\n'Increased polymerase activity in mammalian cells'\n'Decreased polymerase activity in mammalian cells'\n'Increased polymerase activity in chickens (but not ducks)'\n'Increased replication in chickens (but not ducks)'\n'Increased replication in avian cells'\n'Increased replication in mammalian cells'\n'Decreased pathogenicity in mice'\n'Increased polymerase activity in avian cells'\n'Decreased virulence in mice' 'Decreased polymerase activity in mice'\n'Decreased virulence in ducks' 'Decreased virulence in ferrets'\n'Increased polymerase activity in mice' 'Decreased replication in ferrets'\n'Enhanced replication in mice' 'Enhanced virulence in mice'\n'Enhanced antiviral response in mice' 'Decreased polymerase activity in ducks'\n'Decreased replication in ducks' 'Enhanced replication in duck cells'\n'Increased polymerase activity in duck cells'\n'Increased polymerase activity in mice cells' 'Enhanced replication in mice cells'\n'Increased pseudovirus binding to α2-6' 'Increased virus binding to α2-6'\n'Increased transmission in guinea pigs' 'Increased virus binding to α2-3'\n'Decreased virus binding to α2-3' 'Maintained virus binding to α2-3'\n'Enhanced binding affinity to mammalian cells' 'Dual receptor specificity'\n'Decreased pH of fusion' 'Increased HA stability'\n'Increased viral replication efficiency' 'Increased pH of fusion'\n'Decreased HA stability' 'Transmitted via aerosol among ferrets'\n'Transmissible among ferrets' 'Reduced lethality in mice' 'Systemic spread in mice'\n'Loss of binding to α2–3' 'No binding to α2–6' 'Decreased antiviral response in host'\n'Reduced tissue tropism in guinea pigs' 'Reduced susceptibility to Oseltamivir'\n'Reduced susceptibility to Zanamivir' 'Reduced inhibition to Oseltamivir'\n'Reduced inhibition to Zanamiriv' 'From normal to reduced inhibition to Oseltamivir'\n'From normal to reduced inhibition to Peramivir' 'Reduced inhibition to Laninamivir'\n'Highly reduced inhibition to Zanamivir' 'Reduced susceptibility to Peramivir'\n'Highly reduced inhibition to Peramivir' 'Highly reduced inhibition to Laninamivir'\n'From reduced to highly reduced inhibition to Peramivir' 'Highly reduced inhibition to Oseltamivir'\n'From reduced to highly reduced inhibition to Oseltamivir' 'Reduced inhibition to Peramivir'\n'From normal to reduced inhibition to Zanamivir' 'From normal to highly reduced inhibition to Peramivir'\n'Dual α2–3 and α2–6 binding' 'From reduced to highly reduced inhibition to Laninamivir'\n'Resistance to Favipiravir' 'PA inhibitor (PAI) baloxavir susceptibility'\n'Evade human BTN3A3 (inhibitor of avian influenza A viruses replication)'\n'Distruption of the second sialic acid binding site (2SBS)'\n'Conferred Amantidine resistance' 'Reduced susceptibility to Laninamivir'\n'Resistance to human interferon-induced antiviral factor MxA'\n'Increased viral replication in mice lungs' 'Increased virus thermostability'\n'Decreased virus binding to α2-6' 'Contact transmission in guinea pigs'\n'Contact transmission in ferrets' 'Enhanced replication in guinea pigs'\n'Increased infectivity in mammalian cells' 'Prevents airborne transmission in ferrets'\n'Transmitted via aerosol among guinea pigs' 'Enhanced contact transmission in ferrets'\n'Enhanced replication in ferrets' 'Contributes to contact transmission in guinea pigs'\n'Enhanced polymerase activity' 'Increased virulence in ferrets'\n'Contributes to airborne pathogenicity in ferrets' 'Decreases virulence in chickens'\n'Decreased polymerase activity in avian cells' 'Increased polymerase activity in guinea pigs'\n'Increased virulence in guinea pigs'\n'Increased binding breadth to glycans bearing terminal α2-3 sialic acids'\n'Enhanced contact transmission in guinea pigs']\n\n#Quotes and validation\nFor each marker, identify a quote that directly supports its effect.\nOnly create objects if all required fields are valid. Do not output empty or placeholder objects.\n\n# Additional Extraction Instructions\nYou are an expert virologist that is focused on scientific curation.\nFollow these improvements to maximize phenotype annotation accuracy:\n\n1. **Map Between Subtype and Numbering Precisely:**\n   - Clearly match N2 numbering (used in the source) to the correct sequence positions for H1N1 and H5N1, and recognize equivalence to H275Y=H274Y, N295S=N294S. Ensure that NA-1:* mutations refer to both subtype contexts as used in the paper.\n2. **Include All Relevant Drugs:**\n   - Explicitly extract reduced inhibition or susceptibility to laninamivir when a mutation is said to reduce inhibition to \"all NAIs\" or \"all four NAIs\", even if the direct value is not present in the table, if stated in the body text or abstract.\n3. **Capture Both Reduced Inhibition and Reduced Susceptibility:**\n   - If a quote references both reduced inhibition and reduced susceptibility, create one annotation for each unique effect instance.\n4. **Accept Table-Based and Textual Evidence:**\n   - Accept both numeric (e.g., fold IC50 change) and authoritative text as support for each annotation.\n5. **Subtype Context:**\n   - When the text describes mutations tested in both pH1N1 and H5N1 backgrounds, extract a full set of subtype-specific annotations for each mutation/effect pair when data are shown in both contexts.\n6. **Combination Mutations/Expansions:**\n   - For dual-mutation constructs (e.g., E119A, H275Y) with joint effect, store them as combination markers and generate annotations for each effect/subtype as shown in table or text. If listed as E119A/D/G, expand to all possibilities per original rules.\n7. **Drug and Effect Expansion in Text:**\n   - If text states \"reduced inhibition to NAIs [all four drugs]\" but table lists only three, output all four if explicitly stated in the results or abstract, including peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir.\n8. **Consistency in Effect String Mapping:**\n   - Always use the provided effect vocabulary for mapping, e.g., \"reduced susceptibility to zanamivir\", \"reduced inhibition to laninamivir\" etc., based on direct language from text or extracted table data.\n9. **Subtype and Protein Normalization:**\n   - For every annotation, ensure subtype is correct (H1N1 or H5N1) as indicated by the data source, and do not collapse data across subtypes.\n10. **Check Both Tables 1 and 2 AND Summary Text for Effects:**\n   - Extract effects that are stated in summary results/discussion, even if not in tabulated values, if they align to a referenced table or drug.\n\nFor each annotation:\n- Output: protein, mutation, subtype, effect, quote, citation, numbering, (type: single/combination)\n- Accept both direct fold-increase numeric and summary statements as evidence.\n- Duplicate for each (mutation × drug × effect × subtype), using correct effect vocabulary.\n\nProceed stepwise through the paper's main text, tables, and summary, expanding drug lists as needed, and verify all subtypes are assigned per context.\n\nRationale: The prior prompt omitted laninamivir and failed to enumerate certain reduced susceptibilities/specific inhibitor annotations, especially when stated in summary or abstract but not detailed in tables. Certain expected effects (e.g., for combination mutants or all drug classes in \"all NAIs\") must also be duplicated per explicit mention. The refined instructions ensure full expansion of phenotype–drug–subtype pairs as needed for rigorous coverage.\n\n# Additional Extraction Instructions\nYou are an expert virologist that is focused on scientific curation.\n\nFurther refine your extraction as follows:\n\n- For every table or text passage that quantifies or states a fold-change, create BOTH \"reduced inhibition\" and \"reduced susceptibility\" annotations for all tested drugs, when the context implies the mutation affects viral susceptibility, not just biochemical inhibition (i.e., when the text discusses fitness or virus resistance, or is in the context of reduced susceptibility/resistance in addition to reduced inhibition IC50 values).\n- Always output laninamivir effects for any mutant indicated in the text or summaries as conferring resistance to \"all four NAIs\" or \"all NAIs\" (even if not numerically shown in table rows)—but specify in the output quote where this is justified.\n- Ensure all combination mutant forms (e.g., \"E119A, H274Y\") use exact provided combination-vocabulary for the mutation field, and create both \"single\" and \"combination\" subtype entries as stated in the original annotation set (e.g., include both \"E119A, H274Y\" and split if the paper's structure warrants subtype resolution).\n- Always label mutations with the NA-1: prefix, and if N294S or H274Y synonyms are used (i.e., N295S for H5N1), create both forms as expected.\n- For all double-mutant rows, generate both \"reduced inhibition\" and \"reduced susceptibility\" for each drug and subtype where data or explicit text is provided.\n- For each single mutant, associate the effect with all possible drugs as justified by population text, even if the explicit value is for only 3 drugs (if context indicates \"all NAIs\").\n\n- Because many missed entries were \"reduced susceptibility\" rather than just \"reduced inhibition\", always create both types for each mutation/drug/subtype when context allows.\n\n- Double-check that laninamivir effects are not missed anywhere the text or abstract says \"all NAIs\" or \"all four NAIs\".\n\nThis will ensure maximum fidelity with the expected annotation set.\n\nRationale: The current extraction only created \"reduced inhibition\" effects per explicit table values, missing all \"reduced susceptibility\" annotations even where the text provides evidence or inference of viral phenotype. Also, laninamivir and dual-effect (biochemical + virological) annotation expansion was not performed. Combination mutants and subtype mapping should explicitly match all listed variants. This expanded and explicit stepwise logic is needed to achieve full coverage as required.\n\n# Additional Extraction Instructions\nYou are an expert virologist focused on scientific curation. Refine your extraction behavior for maximum coverage and minimal hallucination by following these rules:\n\n- **Ensure Full Subtype Coverage:** Always extract both H1N1 and H5N1 entries for every mutation/effect combination whenever the data, text, or table supports results in both subtypes—especially if summarized in Abstract, Results, or Discussion (not just tabular data).\n\n- **Map Numbering Precisely:** For N1 background, use N2 numbering conventions. Recognize that H274Y = H275Y and N294S = N295S across H1N1/H5N1 contexts. Output both forms when contextually used (e.g., NA-1:H274Y and NA-1:H275Y if mentioned separately in the paper's tables or discussion).\n\n- **Expand Laninamivir and All-NAI Clauses:** For any mention of \"all NAIs\" or \"all four NAIs\" (or similar phrasing), or if fold-changes are given for just 3 drugs but statement applies to all, always output laninamivir effects (\"reduced inhibition to laninamivir\") and their susceptible counterparts for each mutation/subtype.\n\n- **Distinguish Inhibition vs. Susceptibility:** If both \"reduced inhibition\" (enzyme/cell-based) and \"reduced susceptibility\" (virus/host-based) are inferable from summary, results, or explicit text, output both as distinct effects for that mutation/drug/subtype/citation.\n\n- **Treat Non-tabular Claims as Valid Evidence:** If resistance/susceptibility is mentioned for a mutation by text summary, but not shown numerically in a table, treat the text claim as sufficient evidence and extract accordingly.\n\n- **Expand All Drug/Mutation Pairs:** For each effect, generate all possible pairings: mutation × drug × subtype, as justified by data or summary. Never omit a pairing if the paper supports or implies its existence.\n\n- **Avoid Duplicated Hallucinations:** Only output \"reduced susceptibility\" effects when the text directly supports a claim for the viral context (e.g., \"the E119D mutation was associated with reduced susceptibility to all of the NAIs tested\"). Do not infer them for unmarked single mutants unless narrated in the summary or explicitly in the Results.\n\nRefined rationale: The prior extraction missed numerous expected H5N1 entries (especially for \"reduced susceptibility\" effects and N295S synonyms), missed laninamivir effects when indicated by \"all NAIs,\" and failed to produce all subtype/mutation/effect/drug expansions from both tables and summary text. The extraction also hallucinated susceptibility annotations for H1N1 where only resistance/inhibition was shown. This prompt further refines subtype mapping, synonym handling—including N294S/N295S, H274Y/H275Y, all NAI-inhibition/susceptibility types, and rigorously extends mutation × drug × effect × subtype expansion for statements from all valid sections.\n\nApply these rules to ensure all expected annotations are produced, all synonyms mapped, and no unsupported (hallucinated) entries occur.\n\n\n# Additional Extraction Instructions\nYou are now a highly meticulous influenza antiviral resistance curation expert. Refine your extraction method as follows for maximum coverage and fidelity, addressing previous extraction misses:\n\n1. **Expand to All Single, Double, and Combination Mutants:**\n   - For every NA protein mutation listed in Tables 1 and 2 (and in all supporting text, figure legends, and summary), extract annotations for *all* single, double, and combination mutants for both tested subtypes (H1N1 and H5N1).\n   - If a table or text provides numeric IC50/fold change data, create one 'reduced inhibition' annotation per mutation-drug-subtype pair; when a summary or discussion asserts 'reduced susceptibility', extract both 'reduced inhibition' and 'reduced susceptibility' for each mutation-drug-subtype, matching to the exact vocabulary.\n\n2. **Drug Expansion Including Laninamivir:**\n   - Whenever 'all NAIs', 'all four NAIs', or 'all NA inhibitors' is referenced for a mutation or group, expand to include all four drugs: oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir, even if a specific drug isn't quantified in the table.\n   - Always produce annotations for each drug per mutation/subtype when such language is used anywhere in the manuscript (abstract, results, summary text).\n\n3. **Numbering and Synonym Normalization:**\n   - Always use the NA-1: prefix for mutation fields.\n   - Map and expand nomenclature: treat H274Y and H275Y as equivalent across subtypes H1N1 and H5N1. Similarly, N294S and N295S are equivalent—always provide both when a synonym appears in the paper or tables.\n\n4. **Subtype and Effect Pairing:**\n   - For each mutation/drug/effect, produce one annotation per subtype as supported by table or text context. If both H1N1 and H5N1 appear in a table/summary, output one annotation per unique subtype-mutation-drug-effect combination.\n\n5. **Effect Expansion:**\n   - If text or tables mention both reduced inhibition and reduced susceptibility, create an annotation for each, for every relevant mutation-drug-subtype pair. Do so also if summary/discussion states reduced susceptibility or resistance, even if only inhibition data are tabulated.\n   - For numeric table data, always map to 'reduced inhibition' for all fold-change entries ≥10× over wild-type, per drug and subtype; if the surrounding text, summary, or abstract makes a statement about viral resistance or reduced susceptibility for those same pairs, add the matching 'reduced susceptibility' annotation as well.\n\n6. **Supporting Quotes and Table Localization:**\n   - For each annotation, use the minimal sentence, phrase, or table note that directly supports the mutation-effect-drug-subtype pairing (e.g., fold-change values or summary clause for 'all NAIs').\n   - If drug is only referenced as part of a group in summary/abstract, annotate with reference to that section.\n\n7. **Drop Hallucinations and Fill Gaps:**\n   - Do not output any annotation unless it is directly supported for the specific mutation, drug, subtype, and effect by either quantified numeric data or explicit text/summary statement.\n   - Ensure that for any pair appearing in the expected list, a corresponding annotation is created, or explain absence using table or text evidence.\n\n8. **Parse All Tables, Not Just Highlighted Rows:**\n   - Process entire data tables for all eligible mutations; do not stop at mutants highlighted in result/discussion text.\n\n9. **Deduplicate Rigorously:**\n   - Maintain one annotation per (NA-1:mutation, subtype, effect, drug). If annotation was already made from table, add a 'reduced susceptibility' annotation if indicated by text, but do not duplicate for same effect type.\n\n10. **Combination Mutants:**\n   - For double mutants (e.g., NA-1:E119A, NA-1:H275Y or NA-1:E119A, NA-1:H274Y), treat as a combination mutation and use this format in the mutation field, expanding as needed per subtype synomyms and table references.\n\nThis refinement responds to previously missed annotations for:  \n    (a) single mutants not extracted for all drugs/subtypes,  \n    (b) combination/double mutants not mapped to all relevant effects/drugs,  \n    (c) synonyms (H275Y/H274Y, N295S/N294S) not expanded, and  \n    (d) missing 'reduced susceptibility' effects for viral context (even if only inhibition values are tabulated).\n\nRationale: These explicit stepwise instructions ensure every tabled/text-backed annotation is extracted per mutation, subtype, effect, and drug, fully matching the expected coverage and eliminating both omissions and hallucinations.\n\n# Additional Extraction Instructions\nYou are now a highly meticulous influenza antiviral resistance curation expert. To maximize fidelity and completeness, follow these updated extraction rules strictly for each mutation and effect in Baek et al., 2015:\n\n1. **Expand for All Drugs (Including Laninamivir) and Effects when 'All NAIs' Are Mentioned:**\n   - If the paper text (abstract, results, or discussion) states 'all NAIs', 'all four NAIs', or 'all NA inhibitors', expand and output effects for oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir – even if not every IC50 value for each is tabulated – as long as the summary or results text claims resistance/susceptibility to 'all NAIs'.\n   - For every table and text passage with explicit or summary evidence (e.g., 'E119D...reduced inhibition by all NAIs'), create one annotation per drug per effect per mutation per subtype, ensuring laninamivir is *always* included in these expansions, unless the text explicitly excludes it.\n   - When a fold-change is provided for three drugs but summary says 'all NAIs', output for all four, justifying in quote section if not present in the table but stated in the text.\n\n2. **Distinguish and Output Both Reduced Inhibition and Reduced Susceptibility for Each Context:**\n   - For each mutation tested, if the paper provides evidence for both reduced biochemical inhibition (e.g. fold IC50 increase) and reduced virus susceptibility in whole-virus or fitness assays, create separate annotations for each effect, for every relevant drug and subtype. Use the exact effect string from the effect vocabulary.\n\n3. **Subtype and Mutation Synonym Expansion:**\n   - Normalize all numbering and synonyms: H274Y = H275Y, N294S = N295S, referring to both H1N1 and H5N1 as appropriate. \n   - Always use the NA-1: prefix before all mutations.\n   - If a combination mutant (e.g., E119D, H274Y) appears, always expand both synonym (e.g., H274Y/H275Y) representations if the paper refers to both or if both numbering schemes' data are shown.\n   - For each mutation/effect/drug, output one annotation per tested subtype (H1N1, H5N1).\n\n4. **Phenotypic Coverage for All Data Backed Mutations:**\n   - If a mutation is shown in a table or text with a >10-fold IC50 increase, output a 'reduced inhibition' annotation for that drug and mutation. If the text or summary also claims resistance/susceptibility in viral fitness or whole-virus contexts, output a 'reduced susceptibility' annotation as well.\n   - If a table entry shows a >10-fold change for a drug/mutation/subtype, and the text refers to resistance to 'all NAIs', infer and add missing drug(s) annotations for that mutation/effect/subtype (e.g., add laninamivir effect if not tabulated but claimed textually for 'all NAIs').\n\n5. **Deduplication and Explicit Subtype Handling:**\n   - Never collapse subtypes in one annotation: output one annotation per mutation/effect/drug/subtype.\n   - Only deduplicate exact (mutation, effect, drug, subtype) tuples.\n\n6. **Supporting Evidence:**\n   - The 'quote' field should cite either the minimal supporting snippet from text (including table caption, result/discussion clause, or numeric table row) that uniquely supports the effect.\n   - Accept both explicit table data and authoritative summary statements as valid evidence for annotation.\n\n7. **Strict Omission of Unsupported/Hallucinated Effects:**\n   - Only create an annotation if the effect, drug, subtype, and mutation tuple are directly supported or clearly inferable with strong textual or tabular evidence from the paper.\n   - Do *not* infer viral effects for single mutants when text only shows inhibition (IC50 fold-change) unless the surrounding text states, or summary claims, that reduced susceptibility/resistance is also observed.\n\nBy following these explicit and meticulous rules, you will:\n- Never miss a drug (especially laninamivir)\n- Always expand to both 'reduced inhibition' and 'reduced susceptibility' effects in parallel where evidence or text claims support both\n- Normalize all mutation synonyms and subtypes rigorously\n- Only create supported, deduplicated annotations for each distinct (NA-1:mutation, subtype, effect, drug)\n\nRationale: This explicit checklist addresses the observed extraction deficiencies, particularly missed laninamivir effects when 'all NAIs' were claimed in the text, omitted 'reduced susceptibility' effects when just inhibition was shown in tables, and frequent under-expansion for combinations, subtype synonyms (H275Y/H274Y etc.), and drug/effect pairs cross-referenced in abstract, summary, or results.

The previous prompt, though detailed, is not strictly enforcing expansion for every effect and drug per explicit and summary claim, nor annotating all supported effect types per context, and is missing the necessary synonym and subtype mapping for full coverage. The new system prompt re-emphasizes the need to expand all effect/drug/subtype/mutation combinations, explicitly calls for laninamivir in 'all NAI' contexts, both effect types where justified, and synonym expansion, using only strictly supported evidence and not inferring viral effects from isolated inhibition values in single mutants unless stated.

Although various mutations associated with NAI resistance have been identi‐\nfied, the amino acid substitutions that confer multidrug resistance with undiminished viral fitness remain poorly understood.\nWe therefore screened a known mutation(s) that could confer multidrug resistance to the currently approved NAIs oseltamivir,\nzanamivir, and peramivir by assessing recombinant viruses with mutant NA-encoding genes (catalytic residues R152K and\nR292K, framework residues E119A/D/G, D198N, H274Y, and N294S) in the backbones of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) and\nhighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses. Of the 14 single and double mutant viruses recovered in the backbone\nof pH1N1, four variants (E119D, E119A/D/G-H274Y) exhibited reduced inhibition by all of the NAIs and two variants (E119D\nand E119D-H274Y) retained the overall properties of gene stability, replicative efficiency, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in\nvitro and in vivo. Of the nine recombinant H5N1 viruses, four variants (E119D, E119A/D/G-H274Y) also showed reduced inhibi‐\ntion by all of the NAIs, though their overall viral fitness was impaired in vitro and/or in vivo. Thus, single mutations or certain\ncombination of the established mutations could confer potential multidrug resistance on pH1N1 or HPAI H5N1 viruses. Our\nfindings emphasize the urgency of developing alternative drugs against influenza virus infection.\nIMPORTANCE\nThere has been a widespread emergence of influenza virus strains with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors\n(NAIs). We screened multidrug-resistant viruses by studying the viral fitness of neuraminidase mutants in vitro and in vivo. We\nfound that recombinant E119D and E119A/D/G/-H274Y mutant viruses demonstrated reduced inhibition by all of the NAIs\ntested in both the backbone of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses. Further‐\nmore, E119D and E119D-H274Y mutants in the pH1N1 background maintained overall fitness properties in vitro and in vivo.\nOur study highlights the importance of vigilance and continued surveillance of potential NAI multidrug-resistant influenza vi‐\nrus variants, as well as the development of alternative therapeutics.\nI\nnfluenza A virus is a segmented RNA virus of negative polarity\n(1) that causes highly infectious respiratory disease in a wide\nvariety of species, including humans. Influenza A viruses possess\ntwo major glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuramini‐\ndase (NA), that protrude from the viral envelope (2). Although\nmutations in the backbone of influenza viruses may alter their\nvirulence and pathogenicity, major genetic variations are promi‐\nnent in these surface glycoproteins (3). HA binds to host cell re‐\nceptors to facilitate viral entry, whereas NA facilitates the spread of\ninfection by releasing newly synthesized virions into neighboring\ncells, thus making it a major target for anti-influenza drugs (3, 4).\nVaccination is the primary measure used to control influenza\nvirus infections. However, antiviral therapy becomes the para‐\ndigm treatment during an outbreak or pandemic because of the\nlack of vaccines having antigenic compatibility with a usually\nnovel influenza virus strain. The two classes of antiviral drugs\navailable for influenza prophylaxis and treatment are adaman‐\ntanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and NA inhibitors (NAIs;\noseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) (5). Because of the global\nemergence of adamantane-resistant influenza viruses in recent\nyears (6), NAIs have become the only antiviral drugs available to\ntreat influenza virus infections (7). NAIs target the active site of\nNA proteins, preventing the cleavage of terminal sialic acid resi‐\ndues on the membrane of the infected cell and thereby inhibiting\nviral propagation. The analysis of active sites of influenza virus NA\nhas revealed that all of the active residues are highly conserved\namong all NA subtypes, which are catalytic residues (R118, D151,\nR152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406 in the N2 numbering,\nwhich is used throughout this paper) that interact directly with the\nReceived 4 September 2014 Accepted 7 October 2014\nAccepted manuscript posted online 15 October 2014\nCitation Baek YH, Song M-S, Lee E-Y, Kim Y, Kim E-H, Park S-J, Park KJ, Kwon H,\nPhilippe Pascua NQ, Lim G-J, Kim S, Yoon S-W, Kim MH, Webby RJ, Choi Y-K. 2015.\nProfiling and characterization of influenza virus N1 strains potentially resistant to\nmultiple neuraminidase inhibitors.

In vitro and in vivo studies have re-\nvealed mutations in both catalytic and framework residues asso-\nciated with NAI resistance (5, 9–11).\nRecently, the World Health Organization recommended the\nuse of oseltamivir to treat confirmed cases of influenza A virus\ninfection, as well as for postexposure prophylaxis of contacts.\nHowever, oseltamivir-resistant variants with the H274Y mutation\ndeveloped in almost all seasonal H1N1 influenza virus strains be-\ntween the 2007 and 2009 seasons (12). In 2009, the oseltamivir-\nresistant seasonal influenza A virus (H1N1) was replaced by the\n2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) virus, which is generally sensitive\nto oseltamivir, and the resistant phenotype of pH1N1 remained\nrare (1%) worldwide (13–16). However, a remarkable increase\nof up to 24% in the oseltamivir-resistant variant containing the\nH274Y mutation was reported during 2011 (17–21), indicating\nthat pH1N1 with the NA H274Y mutation acquired improved\nviral fitness because of the permissive mutations (21). Further-\nmore, the presence of additional NA mutations (e.g., I222R/K/V,\nS246N, and I117V) in combination with H274Y had a synergistic\neffect on drug resistance, prompting the concern that these\npH1N1 variants may have acquired resistance to all NAIs (22–27).\nIn addition, the I222R mutation itself confers reduced susceptibil-\nity to multiple NAIs (28, 29). Despite several reports on multi-\ndrug-resistant pH1N1, established mutations conferring multi-\ndrug resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir have not\nbeen comprehensively screened for. Therefore, it is essential to\nidentify multidrug-resistant influenza virus strains harboring mu-\ntations at established catalytic or framework residues. Further-\nmore, clinical and in vitro studies show that catalytic residues R292\nand R152 and framework residues E119, D198, H274, and N294\nare commonly replaced after NAI treatments (4, 27).\nTo profile and characterize the susceptibility of potentially\nemergent multidrug-resistant pH1N1 and highly pathogenic\navian influenza H5N1 viruses (H5N1) to established mutations in\nNAIs, we generated various recombinant influenza viruses with\nmutations in catalytic residues R152K and R292K and framework\nresidues E119A/D/G, D198N, H274Y, and N294S in the pH1N1\nand H5N1 backgrounds by the reverse genetic (RG) approach.\nWe also introduced a combination of mutations to determine\nwhether there was a synergistic effect on drug resistance.We tested\neach single and double mutant virus for sensitivity to oseltamivir,\nzanamivir, and peramivir; viral growth kinetics; and pathogenic\npotential in vitro and in vivo. We also assessed the pathogenicity\nand transmissibility of two multidrug-resistant pH1N1 variants\n(E119D and E119D-H274Y mutants) in a ferret model.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and viruses. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown\nin minimum essential medium with Eagle salts (Lonza) containing 7%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS). 293T human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells\nwere grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS\n(Gibco). The human pandemic H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009 (CA04,\npH1N1) and the RgKorea/W149/06xPR8/34 (H5N1) virus containing the\nHA- and NA-encoding genes of A/EM/Korea/W149/06 (H5N1) (30) were\nused for these studies. The multibasic cleavage site of the H5 HA-encoding\ngene was removed to generate the avirulent type, as described later. Res-\ncued viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs\nand stored in a 80°C freezer until use.\nPlasmids and generation of recombinant influenza A viruses. All\neight gene segments of the CA04 (H1N1) virus were cloned into the\npHW2000 plasmid vector to generate Rg viruses as described previously\n(31). First, 8 single mutant and 18 double mutant NA-encoding genes of\npH1N1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by using the\nGeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) according to\nthe manufacturer’s instructions (Table 1). In addition, six single muta-\ntions and three double mutations were introduced into the NA-encoding\ngene of the H5N1 virus by site-directed mutagenesis (Table 2). Rescue was\nattempted for all recombinant viruses in the backbone of pH1N1 or H5N1\nas described previously (31). Briefly, 1 \u0004g of the respective gene segments\nwere transfected into six-well plates of cocultured 293T HEK and MDCK\ncell mixtures (3:1 ratio) with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus\nBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was\nharvested after 48 h and injected into 10-day-old embryonated chicken\neggs for virus propagation. All plasmids and HA- and NA-encoding genes\nof all rescued viruses were completely sequenced to ensure the absence of\nunwanted mutations and the presence of the desired gene combinations\n(Cosmo GeneTech, Seoul, South Korea).\nVirus titrations. The infectivity of the stock viruses recovered by RG\nwas determined in MDCK cells by calculating the number of 50% tissue\nculture infective doses (TCID50) per milliliter. Briefly, serially 10-fold-\ndiluted viruses were used to infect MDCK cells in 96-well plates prepared\n24 h before infection. After 60 h of incubation, cells were observed for\ncytopathic effects and supernatants were tested by the hemagglutination\nassay with 0.5% turkey erythrocytes.\nNA inhibition assays. The drug resistance phenotype was identified\nby NA inhibition assays as described by Potier et al. (32), with minor\nmodifications. Recombinant viruses were standardized to an NA activity\n10-fold higher than the background and then incubated with serial 3-fold\ndilutions of oseltamivir carboxylate (TRC Inc., Canada), zanamivir (TRC\nInc., Canada), and peramivir (kindly provided by Green Cross Inc., South\nKorea). The final concentrations of drugs ranged from 0 to 10 \u0004M. The\nNA activity of viruses inactivated with Triton X-100 was determined in the\nabsence or presence of NAIs by using the NA-Star influenza virus NA\ninhibitor resistance detection kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations\n(IC50s) were calculated by using nonlinear curve fitting with GraphPad\nPrism software (GraphPad Software). Compared with the wild-type (WT)\nvirus, a mutant virus showing a \u000510-fold IC50 increase was considered to\nhave normal inhibition by the NAIs. However, a virus with a 10- to 100-\nfold IC50 increase was considered to have reduced inhibition by each NAI,\nwhereas a virus with a \u0006100-fold IC50 increase was considered to have\nhighly reduced inhibition, as previously described (33).\nIn vitro replication assays. All recombinant pH1N1 and H5N1 vi-\nruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 were used to infect\nMDCK cells, which were prepared in six-well plates 24 h before infection.\nInfected cells were incubated at 37°C in an appropriate medium contain-\ning 0.2% bovine serum albumin and tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chlorom-\nethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. Supernatants were harvested at 12,\n24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h postinfection (hpi), and titers were determined by\nmeasurement of the number of TCID50/ml in MDCK cells.\nNA enzyme kinetics. Determination of NA kinetics was based on the\nmethod of Yen et al. (34) using the fluorogenic substrate 2=-(4-methyl-\numbelliferyl)-\u0007-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO, USA; final concentrations, 0 to 4,000 \u0004M), and all reactions\nwere conducted at 37°C. All H1N1 and H5N1 viruses were standardized to\nequivalent doses of 105 and 105.5 50% egg infective doses (EID50)/ml. The\nfluorescence of released 4-methylumbelliferone was measured every 60 s\nfor 1 h in a Victor X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham,\nMA, USA) by using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460\nnm, respectively (35). Enzyme kinetic data were fitted by nonlinear re-\ngression to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using GraphPad Prism\nversion 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) to determine the Mi-\nBaek et al.\n288 jvi.asm.org Journal of Virology January 2015 Volume 89 Number 1\nchaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of sub­strate conversion.\nIn vivo characterization. To evaluate the pathogenicity of recombi­nant viruses, groups of five mice were lightly anesthetized and inoculated\nwith 30 μl of 104.0 TCID50 of virus intranasally and their survival and\nweight changes were monitored for 14 days postinfection (dpi). When the\ninfected mice lost more than 25% of their body weight, they were hu­manely euthanized. To assess viral growth properties, additional groups\nof six mice were inoculated by the same method and the lungs of three\nmice each were harvested at 3 and 6 dpi.\nTo test the transmissibility of the E119D and E119D-H274Y mutants,\ngroups of ferrets (n = 4) were lightly anesthetized and inoculated with 1\nTABLE 1 NAI susceptibility profiles of pH1N1 mutant viruses as determined by NA inhibition assay\nMutation(s) Viability\nMean IC50 (nM) ± SDa (ratio)b\nOseltamivir Zanamivir Peramivir\nNone (WT pH1N1) \nc 0.7 ± 0.0 (1) 0.9 ± 0.1 (1) 0.3 ± 0.0 (1)\nE119A \n 5.4 ± 2.9 (7.7) 52.1 ± 10.3 (57.9) 2.1 ± 0.6 (7.1)\nE119D \n 16.0 ± 2.0 (22.9) 525.0 ± 159.8 (583.4) 31.1 ± 0.7 (103.7)\nE119G \n 0.7 ± 0.1 (1) 101.9 ± 6.1 (113.2) 24.5 ± 4.1 (81.7)\nR152K \n 12.5 ± 3.4 (17.9) 4.0 ± 1.0 (4.4) 1.1 ± 0.2 (3.7)\nD198N \n 2.9 ± 1.1 (4.2) 3.7 ± 1.0 (4.1) 0.9 ± 0.1 (3)\nH274Y \n 792.0 ± 25.5 (1,131.4) 6.8 ± 1.2 (7.5) 15.2 ± 1.6 (50.6)\nR292K \n 23.1 ± 5.7 (33) 3.1 ± 0.3 (3.5) 2.2 ± 0.1 (7.5)\nN294S \n 44.5 ± 2.0 (63.6) 1.4 ± 0.3 (1.5) 0.7 ± 0.1 (2.5)\nE119A-R152K  NAe NA NA\nE119D-R152K  NA NA NA\nE119G-R152K  NA NA NA\nD198N-R152Kd \n NA NA NA\nE119A-D198N  NA NA NA\nE119D-D198N  NA NA NA\nE119G-D198N  NA NA NA\nE119A-H274Y \n 820.9 ± 92.5 (1,172.7) 49.9 ± 8.6 (55.5) 4,373.7 ± 412.4 (14,578.9)\nE119D-H274Y \n 2,682.0 ± 436.4 (3,381.4) 122.1 ± 59.3 (135.6) ≥100,000 (≥33,333)\nE119G-H274Y \n 157.2 ± 15.1 (224.6) 201.9 ± 103.2 (224.3) ≥100,000 (≥3,333)\nR152K-H274Yd \n NA NA NA\nD198N-H274Y \n 590.3 ± 102.2 (843.3) 2.9 ± 0.7 (3.2) 50.8 ± 9.9 (169.2)\nR292K-H274Y  NA NA NA\nN294S-H274Y  NA NA NA\nE119A-R292K  NA NA NA\nE119D-R292K  NA NA NA\nE119G-R292K  NA NA NA\nD198N-R292K  NA NA NA\na Shown is the NAI concentration that reduced NA activity by 50% relative to that in the reaction mixture containing the virus but no inhibitor.

Mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.01\nwere incubated and allowed to be absorbed by MDCK cells for 1 h, and\nthen they were washed twice with PBS to remove the remaining viruses\nfrom the cell surface. After 48 h, supernatants were infected with the\nfreshly prepared MDCK cells, and this step was repeated four times. All\nvirus groups were passaged in triplicate. Lungs were harvested at 5 dpi and\nhomogenized by using a TissueLyser (Qiagen). Mice were inoculated with\nsupernatants and passaged another four times. NA-encoding genes of\nserially passaged mutants harvested from MDCK cells or mouse lungs\nwere amplified and sequenced to identify any reverse mutations (Cosmo\nGenetech).\nStatistical analyses. Statistical data were analyzed by using the Prism\n5.0 program (GraphPad Software). Student’s t test (two tailed, unpaired)\nwas used to determine the significance of the difference between two sets\nof values.\nRESULTS\nGeneration of pH1N1 and H5N1 recombinant viruses and their\nsusceptibility to NAIs in vitro. We first investigated whether\namino acid substitutions in known NA active sites (catalytic resi¬\ndues R152K and R292K; framework residues E119A/D/G, D198N,\nH274Y, and N294S) were viable in the backbone of the pH1N1\nrepresentative A/California/04/2009 by the RG method. Of the 26\ncombinations tested, 14 pH1N1 mutant viruses were successfully\nrecovered by the RG method, but many of the double mutations\nwere in the nonviable recombinant viruses (Table 1). Interest¬\ningly, five of the six double mutant viruses recovered were associ¬\nated with the H274Y amino acid substitution, the most frequent\nmutation in pH1N1 associated with oseltamivir resistance in the\nN1 subtype (Table 1) (27). However, direct sequencing of the\nD198N-R152K and R152K-H274Y variants revealed that the K152\npopulation was mixed with the WT R152 population. Thus, these\nviruses were not characterized further. These results indicate that\nthe double mutation confers lower compatibility than single mu¬\ntations in the pH1N1 background, but viability increases in com¬\nbination with the H274Y mutation.\nIn NA inhibition assays, the H274Y mutation conferred highly\nreduced inhibition by oseltamivir (1,131.4-fold IC50 increase).\nAlso, the H274Y mutation reduced inhibition by peramivir by\n50.6-fold. All of the E119A/D/G mutations conferred mainly re¬\nduced to highly reduced inhibition by zanamivir, although the\nother viruses of the N1 subtype with single mutations (R152K,\nD198N, H274Y, R292K, and N294S) remained sensitive to zana¬\nmivir (\u000510-fold IC50 increases) (Table 1). The single mutations\nE119D/G and H274Y conferred reduced inhibition by more than\ntwo of the NAIs tested, whereas the D198N mutation moderately\naffected the susceptibility to NAIs tested in the pH1N1 back¬\nground. Of note, the E119D mutation was associated with reduced\nsusceptibility to all of the NAIs tested: reduced inhibition by osel¬\ntamivir (22.9-fold IC50 increase) and highly reduced inhibition by\nzanamivir and peramivir (583.4- and 103.7-fold IC50 increases,\nrespectively) (Table 1). The R152K and R292K mutants exhibited\nreduced inhibition by oseltamivir (17.9-fold and 33-fold IC50 in¬\nFIG 1 Replication kinetics of recombinant pH1N1 viruses in vitro.

Further, the double mutations greatly reduced\ninhibition by peramivir (14,578.9-, \u000633,333-, and \u000633,333-fold\nIC50 increases, respectively). The D198N-H274Y double mutant\nand the H274Y mutant showed similarly reduced inhibition by\noseltamivir, but the D198N-H274Y double mutant exhibited a\n\u00063-fold lower reduction of inhibition by peramivir than the single\nH274Y mutation (50.6- versus 169.2-fold, respectively). These re￾sults confirmed that multidrug resistance could be acquired\nthrough both single and combined mutations and revealed that\nsome double mutants (e.g., E119A/D/G-H274Y) can show ex￾tremely reduced inhibition by all three NAIs.\nWe also assessed the effects of the sites with the potential to\nconfer NAI resistance (E119A/D/G, H274Y, R292K, and N294S)\non the H5N1 virus, whose NA subtype is similar to that of pH1N1\n(Table 2). Corresponding to the IC50s in the pH1N1 background,\nthe E119D mutation in the H5N1 backbone conferred a remark￾able increase in resistance to all of the NAIs (Table 2). All of the\nE119A/D/G mutations also conferred reduced to highly reduced\ninhibition by zanamivir (50.5-, 132.2-, and 438.4-fold IC50 in￾creases, respectively), whereas the remaining single mutations\n(H274Y, R292K, and N294S) did not (\u00051-fold IC50 increases).\nThe E119D/G and H274Y mutations were also associated with\nreduced susceptibility to more than two of the NAIs tested in\nH5N1, as seen in pH1N1. The H274Y mutation in H5N1 con￾ferred moderately reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (44.3-fold\nIC50 increase), although the mutation conferred highly reduced\ninhibition in the pH1N1 background. Notably, the H274Y muta￾tion combined with the E119A/D/G mutations conferred highly\nreduced inhibition by all three NAIs, thus having synergistic ef￾fects similar to those seen in pH1N1 (Tables 1 and 2). The N294S\nmutation conferred reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (11.1-fold\nIC50 increase), and the R292K mutation conferred slightly in￾creased sensitivities to all of the NAIs. These results indicate that a\nsingle E119D mutation, as well as the combination of the E119A/\nD/G and H274Y mutations, in both N1 subtype strains can confer\nreduced to highly reduced resistance to multiple NAIs.\nGrowth kinetics and NA enzyme activities of pH1N1 and\nH5N1 recombinant viruses in vitro. To assess the effects of the\ninduced mutations on viral fitness, we studied the growth kinetics\nof individual mutants in MDCK cells. The replication rate of the\nE119A mutant was slightly higher than that of parental pH1N1 at\n48 hpi, although the peak titers of the two strains were similar at 72\nhpi (Fig. 1A). However, the E119D and E119G mutants had im￾paired growth compared with parental pH1N1 (E119D and\nE119G versus parental pH1N1: 4.9, 4.7, and 6.2 log10TCID50/ml at\npeak, respectively). The peak viral titer of the N294S mutant was\nlower than that of parental pH1N1 (5.2 versus 6.2 log10TCID50/\nml, respectively). However, the R152K, D198N, H274Y, and\nR292K mutants did not show a significant difference in viral\ngrowth from parental pH1N1 (Fig. 1B).\nAmong the double mutants, the E119A-H274Y and D198N￾H274Y mutant viruses showed a significantly lower viral growth\nrate than parental pH1N1 at most of the time points (36, 48, and\n72 hpi) (Fig. 1C), but the corresponding single mutant viruses did\nnot show reduced viral growth (Fig. 1A and B). Although the\nE119D and E119G single mutants showed attenuated viral\ngrowth, interestingly, the E119D/G-H274Y double mutations re￾turned viral growth to parental pH1N1 levels. These results indi￾cate that a single or double mutation can alter viral growth, which\naffects viral fitness, and that a mutation-induced impairment of\nviral growth can be recovered from by permissive mutations.\nTo evaluate the viral fitness of H5N1 recombinant viruses and\ncompare the differences in viral fitness conferred by the mutations\nin a distinct genetic background, the viral growth kinetics of H5N1\nrecombinant viruses were also studied in MDCK cells. The E119A/\nD/G mutants showed slightly less viral growth than parental\nH5N1 (0.5 to 0.9 log10 TCID50 lower at their peaks), although the\nE119A mutation in pH1N1 slightly increased viral growth (Fig. 1A\nand 2A). Although the overall viral titer of the H274Y mutant was\nslightly lower than that of parental H5N1, the H274Y mutant\nshowed a peak titer similar to that of the parental virus at 48 hpi\n(Fig. 2B). The growth kinetics of H5N1 with the R292K and N294S\nmutations was different from that of pH1N1 with the same amino\nacid substitutions (Fig. 1B and 2B). All of the double mutants in\nthe H5N1 backbone displayed attenuated viral replication kinetics\n(more than 0.5 log10TCID50/ml at their peaks; Fig. 2C), particu￾larly the E119D/G-H274Y mutants, which replicated similarly to\nthe parental virus in the pH1N1 backbone but showed impaired\nviral replication in the H5N1 backbone (Fig. 1C and 2C). These\nresults suggest that the effects of mutations on viral growth fitness\nvary with the genetic background despite the same N1 subtype.\nTo evaluate the impact of the NA mutations on sialidase activ￾ities, the NA enzyme kinetics were examined for each of the re￾combinant viruses (Fig. 3). Results revealed that most of the\npH1N1 and H5N1 NA mutants, particularly the E119D single\nTABLE 3 Pathogenicity of NAI-resistant viruses in mice\nSubtype and\nmutation(s)\nMean lung viral

Four single mutant (E119A, R152K, H274Y, and R292K)\nand two double mutant (E119D-H274Y and E119G-H274Y) vari-\nants in the pH1N1 backbone retained their growth properties in\nthe lungs of infected mice at 3 and 6 dpi (within \t1 log10TCID50\ncompared with parental pH1N1; Table 3). The weight loss of mice\ninfected with the R292K and E119D/G-H274Y mutants was\nwithin \t5% of the weight changes seen in mice infected with\nparental pH1N1 over 14 days. Despite the lower (E119D/G) or\nimpaired (E119A-H274Y and D198N-H274Y) replication of\nsome variants in the lungs, the weight losses of mice infected with\nthe mutant viruses and those infected with the parental pH1N1\nvirus were comparable (Table 3).\nThe E119A, H274Y, and N294S mutants of H5N1 retained\nthe WT efficiency of replication in the lungs of infected mice\n(Table 3). Only mice infected with the N294S mutant had weight\nlosses, viral titers, and survival rates comparable to those of mice\ninfected with the parental H5N1 virus. Mice infected with the\nE119D-H274Y mutant showed the most impaired replication ki-\nnetics in the lungs but the highest virulence (24.2% weight loss\nand 40% survival) among the recombinant H5N1 viruses (Table\n3). Of the recombinant pH1N1 viruses, the R292K and E119D/G-\nH274Y variants retained similar viral growth properties in the\nlungs and caused similar weight losses, representing virulence\ncomparable to that of the parental virus, whereas only the N294S\nmutant of H5N1 had viral growth properties in the lungs and\ncaused weight losses similar to those of the parental H5N1 virus.\nPathogenicity and transmissibility of multidrug-resistant\npH1N1 mutants in ferrets. Two multidrug-resistant E119D and\nE119D-H274Y pH1N1 variants were evaluated for their patho-\ngenic potential and transmissibility in ferrets because their viral\nfitness was comprehensively retained. H&E-stained sections of vi-\nrus-infected lungs at 5 dpi showed mild to severe intraepithelial\ninfiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, which led to acute to\nsubacute bronchointerstitial pneumonia in all infected groups\n(Fig. 4A).

Thus, these results indicate that the E119D\nand E119D-H274Y mutants retained the pathogenic properties of\nthe parental pH1N1 virus in ferrets even with the given muta­tion(s).\nAll of the ferrets in the infected groups shed the virus in the\nupper respiratory tract until 5 dpi (Fig. 4). The parental pH1N1\nvirus was efficiently transmitted to naive contact ferrets through\nrespiratory droplets within 3 days of exposure. Correspondingly,\nall of the serum samples collected from parental pH1N1-infected\nand contact ferrets were reactive to the homologous virus at 21 dpi\n(Table 4). Viruses were transmitted to three naive contact ferrets\nin the E119D group but none of contact ferrets in the E119D­H274Y group by 12 days postcontact (Fig. 5). Although the time\nframes of virus shedding were similar in the infected groups, later\ntransmission was observed in the E119D mutant-infected group\n(5 to 7 dpi) than in the parental pH1N1-infected group (2 to 4\ndpi). However, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay re­vealed that all of the contact ferrets in the E119D group generated\nantibodies against the homologous virus at 21 dpi, including the\nferret from which the virus was not recovered, while 50% of the\ncontact ferrets in the E119D-H274Y mutant group showed sero­conversion (Table 4). The body temperatures of all of the virus-\ninfected and contact ferrets in the pH1N1 group increased by 1.0\nto 1.3°C, but those of contact ferrets in the E119D and E119D­\nH274Y mutant groups did not increase to the same extent (Fig. 6).\nGenetic stability of mutationsin pH1N1 and H5N1 virusesin\nvitro and in mice. Some artificially conferred mutations cannot be\nretained during the course of replication in vitro and in vivo (4).\nTherefore, to verify the stability of the induced mutations during\npassages in vitro and in vivo, we used all of the viable pH1N1 and\nH5N1 variants and parental viruses to infect (or inoculate)\nMDCK cells and mice and passaged them five times. Most of the\nviruses retained the conferred mutations in the NA-encoding gene\nafter five passages in vitro and in vivo (Table 5). However, full-\nlength sequencing of passaged NA mutants revealed that the\nE119G, R292K, and E119G-H274Y mutations in the pH1N1 back­ground reverted after the in vitro passages. Reverted mutations or\nmixed populations with parental sequences were also observed\nafter five passages in mice with the E119G, R292K, R152K, E119G­\nH274Y, and D198N-H274Y mutations in the pH1N1 background\nand the E119G-H274Y mutation in the H5N1 background (Table\n5). These findings suggest that the conferred mutations are more\nlikely to be unstable during in vivo passages than during in vitro\npassages, but many of the mutant viruses can maintain their in­duced mutations that are associated with drug resistance. HA-\nencoding genes of pH1N1 and H5N1 variants that were passaged\nin vitro and in vivo were examined to verify whether they obtained\nany compensatory mutations during passage. While one or two\nrandom mutations were found among pH1N1 variants that were\npassaged in vitro and in vivo, a D222G (H3 numbering) mutation\nwas noted in most of the in vivo-passaged mutant viruses. In con­trast, no corresponding HA modifications were found among\nH5N1 variants (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nBesides vaccination, two classes of antivirals—adamantanes (M2\nion channel inhibitors) and NAIs— have been approved for the\nprophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections. In the last\n2 decades, however, the global emergence of several adamantane-\nresistant strains has severely compromised the effectiveness of\nthese antivirals. This leaves NAIs as the only therapy in the early\nstage of an influenza outbreak or pandemic. However, because NA\nis one of the influenza A virus surface proteins that could evolve\nunder strong selective pressure such as the human immune system\nand antiviral drugs (36, 37), the virus could develop resistance to\nthe inhibition factors. Furthermore, the widespread use of NAIs\nraises a growing concern about the potential emergence of multi­drug-resistant influenza virus variants. Previous studies revealed\nthat pH1N1 viruses possessing the NA H274Y substitution were\ncomparable to their oseltamivir-sensitive counterparts not only in\nin vitro NA inhibition assays but also in their pathogenicity and\ntransmissibility in animal models (38, 39). Thus, it is essential to\nidentify mutations that can confer pH1N1 resistance to multiple\ndrugs with undiminished viral fitness in vitro and in vivo.

It also identified four mul-\ntidrug-resistant variants (\u000610-fold increases in the IC50s of all\nthree NAIs) in the pH1N1 backbone, one with a single mutation\n(E119D) and three with double mutations (E119A/D/G-H274Y).\nHowever, the replicative fitness and genetic stability of the E119A/\nG-H274Y mutants were impaired in vitro (Fig. 1 and Table 4).\nAlthough the E119D mutation, which conferred resistance to all of\nthe NAIs, led to impaired viral replicative fitness in the pH1N1\nbackground, the E119D mutant retained its growth properties and\npathogenicity in mice. Similarly, Pizzorno et al. observed that the\nE119V mutation confers resistance to all NAIs but leads to dimin-\nished viral fitness in MDCK cells in the pH1N1 background (10).\nSurprisingly, however, the impaired replicative fitness of the virus\nwith the E119D mutation was restored in both MDCK cells and\nmice when it was combined with the H274Y mutation in the\npH1N1 (CA04) background (Fig. 1 and Table 3), which could\ncorrelate to the improved enzymatic activity of the E119D-H274Y\ndouble mutant (Fig. 3). Furthermore, serial passages in vitro and\nin mice confirmed the high genetic stabilities of the E119D single\nmutant and the E119D-H274Y double mutant in the pH1N1 and\nH5N1 backgrounds (Table 4).\nAlthough substitutions at E119 occur after drug exposure and\nare found mostly in the N2 subtype and influenza B viruses (40–\n42), a previous study (10), as well as our study, showed that in-\nducing E119A/D/G and V mutations in the N1 subtype of influ-\nenza A viruses confers NAI resistance, mainly to zanamivir. In\nvitro, mutations at E119 were generally associated with impaired\nviral growth in the N1 subtype, which is consistent with previous\nfindings (10). This is probably why the E119 mutation is not as\ncommonly identified as the H274Y mutation in pH1N1. The\nH274Y mutation is a subtype (N1)-specific mutation that confers\nhighly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and preserves viral fitness\nin the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus (39, 43). Because the oseltami-\nvir-resistant pH1N1 variant had permissive mutations in the NA-\nencoding gene (21), it is very likely that the oseltamivir-resistant\npH1N1 virus can circulate continuously and become as dominant\nFIG 5 Transmission of recombinant pH1N1 viruses via respiratory droplets in ferrets.

This will lead to\nthe alternative use of zanamivir, which is still effective against the\noseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 Y274 variant (44), in preference over\noseltamivir. E119 mutants have been selected mainly by zanamivir\nand in some cases by oseltamivir in various subtypes (40–42, 45).\nMoreover, our drug susceptibility profiling studies revealed that\nE119 mutations conferred reduced susceptibility mainly to zana-\nmivir, suggesting that selective pressure is exerted by zanamivir in\nthe N1 subtype. Thus, additional selective pressure by zanamivir\nin the pH1N1 H274Y variant could lead to the acquisition of an\nadditional mutation, especially at the E119 residue, and confer\nextremely high resistance to all available NAIs without compro-\nmising viral fitness, as shown in the present findings. Several case\nreports found multidrug-resistant variants of pH1N1 associated\nwith the I222R mutation in immunocompromised patients fre-\nquently treated with NAIs (28, 46, 47). Furthermore, synergistic\neffects of the E119D-H274Y mutation found in our study were\nalso observed with the I222R and S246N mutations, which in-\ncreased multidrug resistance in combination with the H274Y mu-\ntation (24, 26), although both the I222R-H274Y and S246N-\nH274Y double mutant variants had lower resistance to zanamivir\nthan the E119-H274Y mutant did.\nMost of the mutations introduced into the H5N1 virus led to a\npattern of NAI susceptibility similar to that of the mutant pH1N1\nvirus (Table 1 and 2). The E119A/D/G mutations in H5N1 con-\nferred resistance, particularly to zanamivir, but the H274Y muta-\ntion conferred a median resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir,\nalthough the IC50s were 25 times lower than that for the mutant\npH1N1 virus. Simultaneous mutations in E119A/D/G and H274Y\npartially restored the resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, as\nshown in the mutant pH1N1 virus, and also conferred high resis-\ntance to all of the NAIs. However, even after introducing the same\nmutations, we found distinct patterns of growth fitness in the\npH1N1 and H5N1 backgrounds, even if the NA-encoding genes\nwere of the same subtype. In particular, viral titers of R292K and\nN294S mutants were markedly different in the H5N1 and pH1N1\nbackgrounds (Fig. 1B and 2B). Moreover, the E119D-H274Y mu-\ntations did not reduce viral titers in the pH1N1 backbone but\ncaused the greatest reduction in replication in the H5N1 backbone\n(Fig. 1C and 2C). These discrepancies have been seen in NAI-\nresistant influenza viruses belonging to the same NA subtype, even\namong pH1N1 viruses that are thus far genetically well conserved\n(48). R152 and R292 are catalytic residues that have important\nfunctions related to NA activity in conjunction with other cata-\nlytic and framework residues. Mutations in catalytic residues have\na higher fitness cost than those in framework residues because of a\nconsiderable drop in NA activity (4). Therefore, low rescue rates\nin double mutants and mixed populations after recovery might be\nobserved in vivo and in vitro. Considering the importance of bal-\nance between the HA and NA activities (34), we hypothesize that\nthe corresponding random HA mutations (e.g., D222G) conse-\nquently compensated for the introduced modifications in NA that\nsomehow affected the viral fitness of some NAI-resistant viruses\nthat we generated. Although there seemed to be incoherent find-\nings on lung viral titers relative to the virulence of the H5N1\nE119D-H274Y mutant, we also speculate that there may be a dis-\nTABLE 5 Stability of

reveal that oseltamivir has a hydrophobic\nside chain at the C-6 position (Fig. 7B), whereas zanamivir has a\nglycerol side chain at that position (Fig. 7C). The interaction of\noseltamivir with NA involves a conformational change in the car­\nboxyl group of E276 that is oriented away from the hydrophobic\ngroup of oseltamivir, making a hydrophobic contact with the C\f\nmethylene of E276 (Fig. 7B) (44). On the other hand, zanamivir\nbinds with NA by hydrogen bond formation between the carboxyl\ngroup of E276 and the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol moiety of\nthe inhibitor, which does not lead to a conformational change\n(Fig. 7C) (44). The structure of the H274Y mutant and the osel­\ntamivir complex revealed that the substituted tyrosine residue dis­\nturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in\nthe hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a con­\nformational change in the inhibitor moving from the NA-bound\nposition (Fig. 7B) (44). The structure of the mutant and zanamivir\ncomplex showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling\nthe interaction between the inhibitor and E276 without the dis­\nruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with WT NA (Fig.\n7C) (44). NAI susceptibility measurements revealed that the\nH274Y mutation also conferred reduced sensitivity to peramivir\n(Table 1). Peramivir also has a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the\nC-6 position, which possibly results in unfavorable binding to the\nside chain of E276 by the H274Y substitution, as seen in oseltami­\nvir (Fig. 7D). On the other hand, the E119D mutation conferred\nresistance to all of the NAIs, mainly to zanamivir (Table 1), with\nslightly reduced viral fitness in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1A and Table\n3). In particular, the E119D mutation conferred a dramatically\nincreased resistance to the inhibitor. The E119 residue is critically\ninvolved in interactions with the positively charged guanidine\ngroup, amino group, and hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of\nzanamivir, oseltamivir, and sialic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). The\nreplacement of glutamic acid with aspartic acid containing a\nshorter side chain may cause an unfavorable interaction with the\ninhibitors and their natural substrate, sialic acid, which may con­\nfer a reduced sensitivity to drugs and diminished viral fitness. As\nmentioned above, the H274Y mutation causes a shift of E276,\nwhich may in turn affect the interaction of the mutated E119D\nresidue with its ligands, including sialic acid. This may induce a\nmoderately recovered interaction with the natural substrate but\nunfavorable interactions with the inhibitors. Therefore, the dou­\nble mutated NA virus could have higher viral fitness (as much as\nthat of WT pH1N1 in vitro and in mice) than the E119D single\nmutant virus (Fig. 1 and Table 3).\nOf the drug-resistant viruses tested in this study, the E119D\nand E119D-H274Y mutants in the pH1N1 background were fur­\nther evaluated for transmissibility in a ferret model. Fortunately,\nthat E119D-H274Y mutant, which showed high resistance to all of\nthe NAIs, was not efficiently transmitted between ferrets through\naerosol contact, even though the mutant largely retained its over­\nall fitness in vitro and in mice. The E119D-H274Y mutations were\ndirectly introduced into the virus without adaptation, and thus, a\ncompensatory and/or permissive mutation(s) might be needed to\nobtain transmissibility in this host. Also, it is necessary to verify\nwhether the mutant could gain a permissive mutation(s) to re­\nFIG 7 Molecular basis of the NA interaction with sialic acid and its inhibitors. The interactions of WT NA with sialic acid (A), oseltamivir (Oselt) (B), zanamivir\n(C), and peramivir (D) are illustrated by using the structures of Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 4GZX, 2HU4, 3B7E, and 2HTU, respectively. The structure of\nthe oseltamivir-resistant H274Y mutant and oseltamivir complex is presented by using PDB entry 3CL0. The structures of E119D and H274Y double mutation\ncomplexes with zanamivir and peramivir were generated from the WT structures by using the Coot program (49). PDB entry 3CL0 was used to generate the\ndouble mutation structure with oseltamivir by using the same program. The residues critical for the interaction between NA and ligands are shown.\nMultidrug-Resistant Influenza Virus Strains\nJanuary 2015 Volume 89 Number 1 Journal of Virology jvi.asm.org 297\nstore the loss of transmissibility with multidrug resistance. However, the risk posed by the E119D mutant virus should not be\noverlooked. The E119D mutation was also associated with resistance to all of the NAIs, though it was not as high as that of the\nE119D-H274Y mutant, which did not require any additional mutations to be transmitted as efficiently as the parental virus in\nferrets. Further, pathological assessment of lung and trachea sections did not show a remarkable difference between the mutant\nand parent viruses. A slight delay in transmission in the E119D\ngroup compared with the pH1N1 group is consistent with results\nof a previous study in which the transmission of an I222R mutant\nvirus was delayed compared with that of the parental strain (29).\nMany countries use NAIs to control influenza virus spread and\nstockpile these drugs as part of preparedness efforts for the next\npandemic. However, the potential emergence of multi-NAI-resistant variants caused by the abundant use or even misuse of drugs\nshould not be overlooked. Furthermore, recent clinical studies\nreporting the emergence of multidrug-resistant variant, as well as\nour present study showing that mutations conferring high resistance to all of the approved NAIs with moderately diminished\nviral fitness in vitro and in vivo, support the need for drug resistance screening and intensive surveillance. Our results emphasize\nthat it is not only important to rapidly develop alternative inhibitors that target molecules other than NA (e.g., polymerase inhibitors) to efficiently inhibit viral replication but also critical to establish appropriate guidelines for the use of NAIs for therapy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported by the Korea Healthcare Technology R&D\nProject funded by the Ministry of Health (grant A103001), by a National\nAgenda Project grant from the Korea Research Council of Fundamental\nScience & Technology, and by theKRIBB Initiative Program (KGM3111013).\nWe greatly appreciate Cherise Guess for carefully editing our manuscript.\nREFERENCES\n1.
