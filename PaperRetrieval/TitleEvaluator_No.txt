Title: <i>Cnidium monnieri</i> Polysaccharides Exhibit Inhibitory Effect on Airborne Transmission of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to present a threat to public health, highlighting the need for safe and multi-target antivirals. In this study, anti-influenza activity, airborne transmission blocking capacity, and immunomodulatory effects of <i>Cnidium monnieri</i> polysaccharides (CMP) were evaluated. Cytotoxicity in A549 cells was assessed by CCK-8 (CC<sub>50</sub> = 8.49 mg/mL), antiviral efficacy against A/California/04/2009 (CA04) by dose-response (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.63 mg/mL), and the stage of action by time-of-addition assays (pre-, co-, post-treatment). A guinea pig model infected with CA04 was used for testing the effect of pre-exposure CMP on transmission, with readouts including nasal-wash titers, seroconversion, lung index, and tissue titers (EID<sub>50</sub>). RT-qPCR was employed to quantify the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in lung tissue, while Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression and phosphorylation status of key proteins involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. CMP suppressed viral replication in vitro within non-cytotoxic ranges, and pre-treatment-rather than co- or post-treatment-significantly reduced titers and cytopathic effect, consistent with effects at pre-entry steps and/or host priming. In vivo, pre-exposure CMP lowered nasal shedding, reduced aerosol transmission (3/6 seroconverted vs. 6/6 controls), decreased lung indices, and diminished tissue viral loads; IAV was undetectable in trachea at 7 days post-infection in pre-exposed animals, and nasal-turbinate titers declined relative to infection controls. Moreover, during in vivo treatment in mice, CMP significantly suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in lung tissue. This effect was mechanistically associated with CMP-mediated regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to attenuation of inflammatory responses. These data indicate that CMP combines a favorable in vitro safety and efficacy profile with inhibition of airborne spread in vivo, supporting further mechanistic, pharmacokinetic, and fractionation studies toward translational development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral effects of Cnidium monnieri polysaccharides on influenza A virus transmission and immune response, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or mutations linked to phenotypes.

Title: The ribosomal landscape in influenza A virus infection: from molecular mechanisms to clinical relevance.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections continue to represent a significant global health concern, both in terms of severe individual cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the potential for the emergence of pandemics. Despite decades of research, therapeutic options remain limited and the pathogenesis of severe disease is not yet fully understood. One critical yet underappreciated aspect is how IAV reprogrammes the ribosomal landscape of the host to facilitate viral replication and evade immune responses. Ribosomes take centre stage during infection, as both the immune response and viral propagation depend on the protein synthesis machinery. Recent studies have shown that the ribosome is not a static structure but can undergo dynamic changes in composition and function (ribosomal heterogeneity), which may influence the balance between viral propagation and host defence. Additionally, cancer research has remarkably demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the ribosome therapeutically. In this review, we summarise emerging evidence on how IAV hijacks the ribosomal landscape, including ribosomal biogenesis, ribosomal proteins, translation factors and associated signalling pathways, and how these changes may shape the course of infection, immune response and lung injury. Drawing parallels with cancer biology, we explore whether components of this reprogrammed landscape could serve as therapeutic targets in severe IAV infection and ARDS. By connecting molecular mechanisms with clinical relevance, we aim to highlight a novel perspective on host-virus interaction that could open avenues for future treatment strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review focuses on host ribosomal changes during influenza infection and their clinical relevance, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The cellular activating protein-1 cFos regulates influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated that influenza A virus (IAV) infection activates activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors as part of the antiviral response. In this study, we identified cFos as the most upregulated AP-1 transcription factor during IAV infection in A549 human lung cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of cFos resulted in impaired IAV replication. Fluorescence microscopy and functional analyses indicated that cFos is implicated in IAV infection through its nuclear function, rather than its cytoplasmic role as an activator of lipid synthesis. The investigation into the role of cFos in IAV infection revealed increased apoptosis and elevated interferon-<i>β</i> mRNA levels in cFos-knockdown A549 cells during IAV infection. This suggests that cFos may enhance cell survival and reduce interferon-<i>β</i> expression during infection, thereby facilitating IAV proliferation. Furthermore, the levels of viral NA mRNA and the expression of late viral proteins NA and M2 decreased upon cFos-knockdown. Overall, this study identifies cFos as a proviral factor for IAV, through the modulation of innate immunity and apoptosis during infection, and potentially by supporting the viral transcription.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of host cellular factor cFos in influenza virus replication, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Mutation rate variability in viral populations: Implications for lethal mutagenesis.
Abstract: Lethal mutagenesis is a strategy to achieve viral extinction by drugging viral mutation rates beyond an extinction threshold. Accurate estimation of the extinction threshold is critical, as elevating viral mutation rates near, but not past this threshold increases the likelihood of mutations that could result in drug resistance, vaccine escape, or increased pathogenesis. Traditional models of lethal mutagenesis rely on the Poisson distribution, which assumes a uniform mutation rate across individuals. Yet, RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) can have varied mutation rates due to mutations in the polymerase complex. This variability suggests that lethal mutagenesis models incorporating mutation rate diversity, such as ones using the gamma-Poisson distribution, may be more accurate for RNA viruses. Poisson models assume count data have equal mean and variance, while gamma-Poisson counts are overdispersed (variance greater than mean). Here, we provide experimental data showing that IAV mutations are overdispersed, indicating that the gamma-Poisson distribution is more appropriate for modeling IAV mutations. Modeling of lethal mutagenesis using the gamma-Poisson distribution reveals that the degree of overdispersion is critical in determining survival or extinction. Increased overdispersion shifts the extinction threshold higher, indicating that Poisson-based models have underestimated the mutation rate required to achieve viral extinction and avoid viral escape or accelerated evolution. Furthermore, time to extinction in simulated populations is significantly longer with gamma-Poisson-based models than Poisson-based. This investigation of how mutation rate variability affects lethal mutagenesis will directly impact antiviral drug design and strategy, thus advancing efforts to combat virus outbreaks and future pandemics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on mutation rate variability and modeling lethal mutagenesis in viral populations, without explicit links between specific viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Lipidomic profiling of influenza A virus production in MDCK cells towards targeted clone selection.
Abstract: High-yield influenza virus production is essential for efficient vaccine manufacturing to support global demands. Using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to produce influenza viruses is an attractive alternative to the conventional method of manufacturing vaccines using embryonated eggs. MDCK cells exhibit heterogeneity which can impact viral yields. However, the factors driving the variation between MDCK cells are not fully understood. Utilizing an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipidomic approach, we investigated two proprietary MDCK clones (C59 and C113) provided by Sartorius (Germany) that differ in biochemical and viral production properties and examined their lipid profiles and dynamics upon influenza A virus (IAV) infection between 24 and 72 h. C113, a high-yield clone, displayed elevated levels across all lipid classes, aside from ether lipids compared to C59, a clone with superior growth properties. IAV infection in clone C59 and C113 displayed key differences, specifically triacylglycerols. Analysis of progeny virions from C59 and C113 clones revealed subtle differences with a positive correlation in lipid profile (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77), suggesting similar lipid raft domains between clones. Overall, these findings highlight specific cellular lipid signatures associated with high-yield production and demonstrate the value of integrating lipidomics methods into biomanufacturing pipelines, providing complimentary quality assurance markers.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates lipidomic profiles of MDCK cell clones affecting influenza virus production but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

The viruses were clade 2.3.4.4b genotype D1.1, closely related to viruses causing poultry outbreaks.

Title: Oral fermented rice bran supplementation suppresses viral replication and stimulates immune functions in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice infected with influenza virus.
Abstract: The number of immunosuppressed elderly persons, who are at a higher risk of developing influenza infection-related complications, has been increasing. Fermented rice bran (FRB) is used as a dietary supplement, exhibits a variety of biological activities, and may exhibit anti-influenza virus activity. However, the effect of FRB supplements on influenza A virus (IFV) infection remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of FRB on influenza prevention by oral administration to IFV-infected mice in an immunocompetent or immunocompromised state. FRB was produced by fermentation of rice bran with a mixture of Bacillus spp, Lactobacillus sp, Bifidobacterium sp, and Aspergillus sp. BALB/c mice orally received FRB (20 mg/day) for 1 or 2 months prior to intranasal IFV inoculation or immediately after IFV infection until 14 days post-inoculation. Weight changes, virus production, levels of neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and histological changes of the intestine were analyzed in FRB-administered mice. FRB-administered immunocompetent mice without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment showed suppressed body weight loss caused by IFV-infection and rapid weight recovery. The virus yields in the lungs of FRB groups were reduced 3 days post-infection. Neutralizing antibody titers in the blood and respiratory tract and IgA levels in the lung and intestine were increased in FRB groups after 14 days of infection. An elevation in IFN-γ levels was observed in the blood of FRB-treated mice on days 3 and 14 after virus inoculation. In immunocompromised mice treated with 5-FU, oral FRB administration beginning 1 month prior to IFV inoculation resulted in significant suppression of body weight loss, reduced viral titers in the lung, elevated systemic and local neutralizing antibody titers, and preservation of normal colonic morphology compared with the control group. In contrast, when FRB was administered 1 h after viral inoculation, these protective effects were present but notably less pronounced than those observed with supplementation pre-inoculation. FRB stimulates local and systemic adaptive immune functions, favors early recovery from influenza, and prolongs protective effects against IFV infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the effects of fermented rice bran supplementation on host immune response and viral replication, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Febrile temperature activates the innate immune response by promoting aberrant influenza A virus RNA synthesis.
Abstract: Fever during influenza A virus (IAV) infection is triggered by the innate immune response. Various factors contribute to this response, including IAV mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), which trigger RIG-I signaling when their replication and transcription are dysregulated by template loops (t-loops). It is presently not well understood whether the fever response to IAV infection affects subsequent viral replication and innate immune activation. Here, we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased antiviral signaling in H1N1 and H3N2 infections. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production increase mvRNA and interferon production. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature, mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever during IAV infection can establish a positive feedback loop in which elevated aberrant RNA synthesis and innate immune activation can contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine production.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates how febrile temperature affects innate immune response and viral RNA synthesis but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Post-Translational Modifications in Respiratory Virus Infection: Recent Insights into the Development of In Vitro Models.
Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are crucial chemical alterations occurring on proteins post-synthesis, impacting various cellular processes. During viral infections, PTMs are shown to play a multitude of roles in viral replication, host interaction, and immune evasion. Thus, these modifications can influence infectivity, with direct impact on the anti-viral host immune responses and potentially viral adaptation across species. This field is still scarcely explored, whilst understanding PTMs is not only important to advance the knowledge of virus pathology but also potentially to provide insights for vaccine development. In this review, we attempt to summarize the latest findings mainly published over the last 10 years, focusing on the roles of PTMs involved in virus infection and anti-viral immune responses, in the context of relevant human respiratory infections: influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. We decided to concentrate on these three viruses because they currently represent a global health problem due to recurrent outbreaks and pandemic potential. A deeper characterization of the PTMs may help in understanding virus-host interaction with possible implications on curative strategies. Further, we will report on cutting-edge technologies to study in vitro virus infection in different cellular-based systems. In particular, we describe and discuss the application of 2D and 3D lung organoid cell-culture systems as in vitro models to mimic respiratory environments and to study the PTMs in a controlled setting. Finally, we will discuss the importance of PTMs in the context of next-generation vaccine design, especially for their potential role to offer effective protection against respiratory viruses.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype C2.1) in commercial ring-necked pheasants during the 2022 outbreak in the United States.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was introduced into North America in 2021. In 2022, clade 2.3.4.4b spilled into domestic poultry in the United States (U.S.), resulting in the largest HPAI outbreak in U.S. history. In December 2023, H5N1 2.3.4.4b was detected on an upland game bird farm in Pennsylvania. History, clinical signs, and gross lesions were suggestive of marble spleen disease. However, HPAI was identified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; gene sequencing confirmed genotype C2.1 with phylodynamic analyses providing evidence of a wild bird introduction. Predictive mathematical modeling estimated the time of virus introduction onto the farm (15 days (95% C.I., 11-23) before the date of confirmed detection) being similar or longer than previously described for domestic poultry. Although bioexclusion measures were unable to prevent the initial exposure due to industry rearing practices, biocontainment procedures appeared to prevent spread. The lessons learned from this case may be important for other animal agriculture commodities, especially those species that are infrequently handled or observed and may have inaccurately calculated mortality levels. This well-characterized outbreak and other experiences with natural infection should be taken as opportunities to better understand the field dynamics of this virus.

Title: A taxonomically harmonized global dataset of wild bird hosts for avian influenza virus surveillance.
Abstract: Wild birds are key natural reservoirs and play a central role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the absence of a standardized global list of wild bird hosts has limited comprehensive AIV risk monitoring and assessment within the One Health framework. Here, we generate a taxonomically harmonized dataset of AIV wild bird hosts, derived from 23,358 viral isolates of wild bird origin reported in the GISAID EpiFlu<sup>TM</sup> database from 1973 to 2023. Host names were systematically extracted, validated, and harmonized to resolve reporting inconsistencies and unify taxonomy across records. The dataset comprises 394 wild bird species spanning 26 orders, with Anseriformes and Charadriiformes representing a substantial share of host diversity. By clarifying the global spectrum of wild bird hosts for AIVs, this dataset provides a foundation for host identification, phylogenetic annotation, and ecological trait-based analysis. Structured in machine-readable formats, it enables reproducible and large-scale, species-level studies spanning virology, epidemiology, and biodiversity.

Title: Spatial mapping of influenza and coronavirus receptors in the respiratory and intestinal tract epithelium of beef cattle using advanced PixF image analysis.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) and coronaviruses (CoV) pose significant threats to various animal species, including cattle. Reports of SARS-CoV-2 infections and recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) in dairy cattle highlight the need to understand receptor distributions critical for viral entry. This study investigates the spatial distribution of IAV and CoV receptors in bovine tissues using PixF, a novel and newly developed web-based image analysis tool. Respiratory (trachea and lung) and intestinal (small and large intestine) tissues from crossbred Holstein-Angus steers were analyzed. Lectin histochemistry staining with fluorescently labeled Sambucus nigra (SA α2,6-Gal receptors) and Maackia amurensis (SA α2,3-Gal receptors) identified IAV receptors, while coronavirus receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, APN, DPP4, and CEACAM1 were assessed using indirect immunofluorescence. PixF provides an initial yet tailored image processing framework for quantifying and mapping receptor expression, revealing a predominance of SA α2,3-Gal receptors in epithelial regions, while SA α2,6-Gal receptors were confined to glandular tissues of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus receptors exhibited variable expression across tissues; TMPRSS2, APN, and DPP4 are highly expressed in the respiratory mucosal epithelium; ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DPP4 are highly expressed in the intestinal mucosal epithelium, while CEACAM1 is notably low across tissues. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of PixF, a simple prototypic fluorescence quantification tool customized for the use case detailed in this work, to provide a browser interface that prioritizes ease-of-use, enabling non-specialists to obtain essential quantification and spatial information quickly. PixF was utilized to elucidate receptor co-localization and enhance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in cattle, offering a reproducible, accessible, and biologically informed analysis pipeline.

Title: Hypervirulent serotype 1 pneumococci display high levels of nasal shedding and rapid onward transmission.
Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (S1) is a major cause of invasive pneumococcal disease. Despite its high attack rate, S1 exhibits a low carriage prevalence within the population, which raises questions about the relationship between nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission of hypervirulent strains between individuals. We compared the transmission dynamics of S1 to serotypes 2 (S2) and 3 (S3) using a novel model of transmission in adolescent mice. Donor "index" mice were intranasally infected with S1, S2, S3 or isogenic pneumolysin-deficient mutants and co-housed with naïve recipient "contact" mice. Three days later, all mice were infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Pneumococcal transmission was analysed during colonisation alone and co-infection with IAV by quantification of the nasal shedding and nasopharyngeal bacterial density in both index and contact mice. The role of the polysaccharide capsule and toxin pneumolysin, as well as biofilm production in shedding and transmission, and the host nasopharyngeal immune response, were investigated. We show that S1 was shed at significantly greater levels than S2 and S3 in index mice, which led to significantly higher shedding and transmission rates in contact mice. S1 produced less biofilm and a thick capsule that promoted its increased shedding and transmission. Interestingly, pneumococcal acquisition led to pneumolysin-dependant macrophage recruitment in the nasopharynx of contact mice. Our results show that rapid and high transmission rate of serotype 1 is a key factor for its success in disseminating quickly within the population and causing outbreaks.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on pneumococcal bacterial transmission dynamics and host immune responses, unrelated to viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Stimulation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells with <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> Strain Plasma Elicits Antiviral Effects Against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Viruses, like influenza and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remain major causes of upper respiratory tract infections worldwide, with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to lethal outcomes. While antivirals and vaccines have helped ameliorate disease morbidity and mortality, these infections still pose significant challenges. Probiotics, including <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> strain plasma (LC-Plasma), have recently shown antiviral effects by activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), though their detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from healthy participants with LC-Plasma and conducted immunological analyses to investigate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of LC-Plasma. The supernatant derived from LC-Plasma-stimulated PBMCs (LCP Sup) exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of replication in Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1) and SARS-CoV-2. LCP Sup significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in Huh-7 cells. However, in the H1N1 antiviral assay using A549 cells, LCP Sup was required at a higher concentration against H1N1 in A549 cells compared with SARS-CoV-2 in Huh-7 cells. Treatment with LCP Sup significantly upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) expression, particularly <i>MxA</i>, in A549 cells. While <i>MxA</i> showed the most notable increase, other ISGs also exhibited elevated expression levels compared with the negative control. Other cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were also induced by LC-Plasma and CpG-DNA stimulation, and the effects of LC-Plasma were much higher than those of CpG-DNA. These results provide in vitro evidence of the antiviral mechanisms of LC-Plasma via upregulation of interferon-α (IFN-α) and related ISGs for host defense against respiratory viruses.

Title: The role of long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs in immune evasion of influenza A virus: recent advances.
Abstract: The capacity of influenza A virus (IAV) to circumvent immune defenses in hosts renders it a persistent major peril to worldwide public health. Investigations conducted lately underscore the vital functions played by circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during interactions between viruses and their hosts. This review summarizes current understanding of how lncRNAs and circRNAs participate in IAV immune evasion by regulating antiviral signaling pathways, interfering with interferon responses, modulating inflammatory cytokine production and cell metabolism, and affecting viral replication. This review examines molecular actions exhibited by particular lncRNAs and circRNAs within such interactions, assesses their suitability for therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, and outlines avenues for subsequent investigations across this fast-developing domain.

Title: Timely vaccine strain selection and genomic surveillance improve evolutionary forecast accuracy of seasonal influenza A/H3N2.
Abstract: Evolutionary forecasting models inform seasonal influenza vaccine design by predicting which current genetic variants will dominate in the influenza season 12 months later. Forecasting models depend on hemagglutinin sequences from global public health networks to identify current genetic variants (clades) and estimate clade fitnesses. The lag between collection of a clinical sample and public availability of its sequence averages ∼3 months, complicating the 12-month forecasting problem by reducing our understanding of current clade frequencies. Despite continued methodological improvements to forecasting models, these constraints of a 12-month forecast horizon and 3-month submission lags impose an upper bound on any model's accuracy. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed that modern vaccine technology reduces forecast horizons to 6 months and expanded sequencing support reduces submission lags to 1 month on average. We quantified the potential effects of these public health policy changes on forecast accuracy for A/H3N2 populations. Reducing forecast horizons to 6 months reduced average absolute forecasting errors to 25% of the 12-month average, while reducing submission lags decreased uncertainty in current clade frequencies by 50%. These results show the potential to improve the accuracy of existing forecasting models through realistic changes to public health policy.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Extracellular Vesicle and Virus Co-Purified Fractions Produced by Contemporary Influenza A and B Viruses in Different Human Cell Lines.
Abstract: Influenza virus is one of the most frequent causes of respiratory infection in humans. Recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs)-small particles released by cells during influenza virus infection-can influence the immune response and viral pathogenesis. However, during viral replication, infected cells can also release EVs, which may include different subtypes. This study aimed to purify and characterize viral preparations and EVs using sequential ultracentrifugation methods. Influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus strains were produced in human Calu-3 and A549 cell lines. Viral supernatants then underwent a series of differential ultracentrifugation steps at 3000× <i>g</i>, 17,000× <i>g</i>, and 100,000× <i>g</i>. Dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS) validated size heterogeneity for all three types of EVs. Measurement of infectious virus particles for all three pellets showed virus enrichment at 17,000× <i>g</i> and 100,000× <i>g</i>. Dot blot analysis confirmed the enrichment of virus particles in these fractions and the presence of EV protein. This study demonstrates the presence of EVs in virus preparations and highlights the need for improved separation methods to characterize them better and explore their role in viral infection pathogenesis.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Essential Oils Against Avian Influenza Virus H7N3 In Vitro and In Ovo Models.
Abstract: The poultry industry is continually seeking efficient, practical strategies to control infectious diseases. Among these new alternatives are essential oils (EOs), naturally occurring compounds with antimicrobial properties. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated in various studies that focus on their broad antiviral properties. The present experiment evaluated the antiviral efficacy of an EOs formulation against the H7N3 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) by directly mixing virus and EOs (virus/EOs mixture) through an in vitro model in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKs). The experiment used a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) by virus/EOs mixture, as well as the application of EOs 24 h before infection, through a viral inhibition test using a chicken embryo (CE) in ovo model. The results demonstrated the antiviral activity of the EOs formulation against the H7N3 in vitro model (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 20.4 and 38.3 ppm and selective index (SI) values of 9.4 and 5.1) and in ovo model (decreasing hemagglutination titers to 1 HA unit, 10<sup>5.28</sup> embryo infectious dose 50% (EID<sub>50</sub>) per mL, and viral loads to approximately 10<sup>11.4</sup> copies/mL) when applied in CE, 24 h before viral infection, representing the lowest replication indicators recorded during the experiment. According to the results, the EOs formulation demonstrated antiviral activity against AIV H7N3 both as a virus/EOs mixture and through application in ovo 24 h before infection. Application 24 h before infection in CE showed a significant effect compared with the virus/EOs mixture, demonstrating an antiviral effect in the ovo infection model. This study demonstrates both the virucidal and antiviral capacity of the compounds in the EOs formulation against AIV H7N3 and their efficacy when applied 24 h before infection in the in ovo model.

Title: Plant-Derived Carotenoid Lutein Demonstrates Multifunctional Antiviral Activity against Influenza A Virus <i>in vitro</i>.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections remain a major global health concern, causing annual outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality. The emergence of drug resistance and adverse effects from existing antivirals underscores the need for new therapeutic agents. This study presents the first evaluation of the antiviral activity and mechanisms of the dietary carotenoid lutein against influenza viruses. Lutein exhibited strong virucidal activity against influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but showed only weak effects against the non-enveloped rotavirus, suggesting a preference for enveloped viruses. Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed that lutein disrupted viral particle integrity, causing aggregation and a reduction in particle numbers. Functional assays further demonstrated that lutein inhibited the activities of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Lutein also suppressed viral replication when applied to cells both before and after infection, indicating its prophylactic and therapeutic potential. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that lutein exerts multifunctional antiviral effects through virucidal activity, inhibition of HA and NA activity, and suppression of viral replication. As the first report to elucidate lutein's multifaceted antiviral mechanisms, this study supports its potential as a natural antiviral candidate. <i>In vivo</i> studies will be essential to further assess its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety for therapeutic applications against influenza.

Title: Development of Nanobody-Expressing Nanosomes for Neutralization of Influenza Virus.
Abstract: Influenza viruses remain a persistent threat to both human and animal health, whereas current countermeasures-vaccination and livestock culling-offer only delayed, partial, or economically burdensome protection. Here, we describe the development of a mucosal nanotherapy based on chromosome-free minicells derived from <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>, engineered to surface-display a broadly reactive anti-hemagglutinin nanobody. These therapeutic agents, termed "neutralizing nanosomes" present nanobody molecules anchored on the minicell surface that retain full binding functionality against a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, including H1N1. Importantly, intranasal administration of neutralizing nanosomes effectively neutralized H1N1 infection <i>in vivo</i>, alleviating physiological symptoms and suppressing viral replication in the respiratory tract of a preclinical mouse model. Unlike vaccines, which require weeks to confer protection, our neutralizing nanosomes provide an immediate barrier at the respiratory mucosa-the primary portal of influenza entry-offering a promising adjunct to existing vaccines and antiviral drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development of nanobody-expressing nanosomes for neutralizing influenza virus infection in vivo, focusing on therapeutic application rather than explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Expression of NEAT1 induced by influenza virus infection is regulated by activated STAT3 and contributes to STAT3-mediated antiviral immunity.
Abstract: The transcription factor STAT3 is integral to the immune response during viral infections, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are actively implicated in the modulation of viral pathogenesis. However, the relationship between STAT3 and lncRNAs during viral infection is poorly understood. Here, we observed that robust expression of NEAT1, an important lncRNA, was induced by infections with influenza A virus (IAV) and several other viruses, but the virus-induced NEAT1 expression was significantly suppressed by inactivation of STAT3 both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, we identified that expression of NEAT1 was regulated via MDA5 and TLR3 signaling pathways involving NF-κB, IL-6, and IFN-β during IAV infection. Disruption of NEAT1 expression markedly facilitated the replication of IAV, whereas overexpression of NEAT1 attenuated the viral replication. NEAT1 knockout mice were further employed and showed that deficiency of NEAT1 significantly enhanced the IAV replication and virulence in the animals. Importantly, we found that activation of STAT3 by innate immune signaling inhibited IAV infection through upregulating the expression of NEAT1, and NEAT1 promoted the production of several vital antiviral molecules including interferons (IFNs) to suppress the viral replication. Moreover, our experiments exhibited that NEAT1 contributed to activation of TBK1 during the IAV infection. Together, these results reveal that NEAT1 functions downstream of STAT3, acting as a regulator of STAT3-mediated immunity by activating TBK1 and thereby enhancing antiviral responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host cellular factors (STAT3 and lncRNA NEAT1) regulating antiviral immunity during influenza virus infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Persistent Leukoencephalopathy Following H1N1 Infection Associated With a Novel MYRF Variant (p.Gly735Asp).
Abstract: Mutations in myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) are linked to demyelinating disorders. We report a 38-year-old male who developed acute symmetric leukoencephalopathy mimicking a stroke following an influenza A virus infection. While clinical symptoms markedly improved with corticosteroids, MRI revealed persistent white matter lesions, contrasting with the known phenotype of MYRF-related mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization (MMERV). Genetic analysis identified a novel MYRF variant (c.2204G>A, p.Gly735Asp) in its C-terminal domain, with familial cosegregation confirming autosomal dominant inheritance. This case demonstrates that viral infections can trigger severe MYRF-related pathology and establishes persistent leukoencephalopathy as a novel clinical phenotype within the MYRF disease spectrum.
Relevant: False
Reason: The report describes a clinical case of leukoencephalopathy associated with a novel human MYRF variant triggered by influenza infection, focusing on host genetics rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Role of long non-coding RNA Lnc9101 and Lnc8475 in regulation of innate immune response to influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of various biological processes, yet their roles in chicken host-virus interactions remain largely unknown. This study investigated the impact of influenza A virus (IAV) H9N2 infection on the expression of two lncRNAs, Lnc9101 and Lnc8475, and the regulatory roles of these lncRNAs in the innate immune response. The results demonstrated that the expression of both lncRNAs were significantly upregulated in H9N2-infected chickens and could be induced by viral genomic RNA, poly (I:C) or LPS. Disruption of Lnc9101 expression in DF-1 cells enhanced the IAV replication, while its overexpression suppressed it. Conversely, Lnc8475 had the opposite effect on the IAV replication compared with Lnc9101. Silencing Lnc8475 expression in DF-1 cells attenuated IAV replication, while its overexpression promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found that both lncRNAs regulated the expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs), thereby affecting multiple interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) expression and STAT1 activation upon IAV infection. Moreover, Lnc9101 knockdown impaired the expression of TLR7 and MDA5 and reduced IRF7 phosphorylation, whereas Lnc8475 knockdown promoted the expression of TLR3 and TLR7. In summary, Lnc9101 inhibits IAV replication by positively regulating the innate immune response, whereas Lnc8475 promotes IAV replication by suppressing it. These findings suggest that LncRNA9101 and Lnc8475 play important roles in pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)-dependent innate immune signaling and antiviral responses, advancing a better understanding of lncRNA functioning in chickens.

Title: Stockholm Paradigm in the Study of Influenza H1N1 Viruses: A New Approach to the Study of Zoonotic Risk Coupling Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Multi-Locus Phylogenies.
Abstract: The Stockholm Paradigm, a multilevel framework for studying coevolutionary interactions, it is a promising method for obtaining a globally relevant understanding of the emergence of present and past host-parasite and insect-plant interactions. This research aimed to expand the application of the Paradigm to virus-host interactions, considering that viruses are being subjected to the same evolutionary forces as any other living organism. By applying different data science techniques, we described and discussed capacity and opportunity traits for Influenza A H1N1 strains, and how they might influence the pathogen's host repertoire evolution, and thus ranked different strains according to their emergence risk in the human population. We hope to contribute to the application of different methods for understanding disease emergence, and consequently to the development of new public health strategies for preventing (re)emerging diseases.

Reason: The paper applies a computational framework to study host-virus interactions and emergence risk but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Curcumin-like diarylpentanoid analogues exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in influenza A virus-infected A549 lung epithelial cells by inhibiting multiple retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated pathways.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics and occasionally pandemics. Curcumin, a well-known phytochemical, has been reported to exhibit anti-IAV effects; however, most studies were not comprehensive and utilized Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Curcumin-like diarylpentanoid analogues, namely 2-benzoyl-6-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexen-1-ol (BDHBC) and 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)penta-2,4-dien-1-one (DHHPD), exhibit improved drug-like properties, including increased solubility and stability, along with stronger antiviral effects against rhinovirus (RV). Thus, this study evaluates the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of BDHBC and DHHPD using A549 lung epithelial cells infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), and compared their antiviral effects with curcumin in different treatment modes (pre-, co- and post-treatment). Like curcumin, BDHBC and DHHPD significantly reduced virus yield in the post-treatment mode and exhibited direct virucidal activity. Post-treatment with BDHBC and DHHPD also significantly suppressed viral replication as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10) and interferons (IFN-β and IFN-λ1) at both the gene and protein levels. The stronger antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of DHHPD were attributed to its inhibition of multiple retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated signalling pathways, including NF-κB, AP-1, MAPKs (p38 and Erk1/2), IRF3 and Akt. Only some of these pathways were affected by BDHBC treatment. Neither compound affected RIG-I or IRF7 expression, which is consistent with their lack of impact on Stat1 activation. Interestingly, DHHPD also demonstrated significant prophylactic effect against IAV infection, which was not observed for BDHBC and curcumin. In conclusion, BDHBC and DHHPD inhibit IAV replication and cytokine responses by targeting host signalling pathways. Further investigation in vivo is required.
Relevant: False

Title: Research note: Use of in vitro and in ovo approaches to characterise avian influenza viruses and assess species specific responses to infection.
Abstract: Circulation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in domestic and wild birds poses a major health threat, requiring a rapid approach to characterize and identify high-risk strains. We evaluated virus replication kinetics and host viability with low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H6N1 and genetically modified avian influenza GM-AIV09 viruses in embryonated eggs and avian cell lines. Virus titres increased steadily in a 72-hour infection in DF-1 cells and embryonated hens' eggs but peaked at 48 hours in CCL-141 cells and embryonated duck eggs. CCL-141 cells exhibited greater virus-induced cell death than DF-1 cells, whereas duck embryos maintained higher viability than chicken embryos. Additional work is needed to establish if there are breed specific differences which may impact categorisation of AIVs using embryonated eggs. Use of embryonated eggs better mirrored relative avian species survivability to AIV infection than use of avian cells.

Title: Influenza virus infection reprograms cholesterol biosynthesis to facilitate virus replication by the TAK1-RORγ axis.
Abstract: Infection and replication of enveloped viruses require host cells to supply substantial amounts of cellular cholesterol for processes such as binding, entry, trafficking, assembly, and budding. However, the mechanisms by which influenza A virus (IAV) regulates cholesterol biosynthesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IAV infection induces the expression of the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ), an orphan nuclear receptor, which cooperates with the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) to regulate the expression of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. RORγ knockout and treatment with two RORγ inhibitors, XY018 and GSK805, suppress IAV-induced HMGCR expression, cholesterol biosynthesis, and viral replication. Notably, exogenous cholesterol rescues the inhibitory effect of XY018 on viral replication. Mechanistically, we show that IAV infection activates RORγ expression through the TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and its downstream kinases, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the IκB kinase (IKK), which in turn activate AP1 and NF-κB. In vivo, RORγ knockout reduces IAV replication, alleviates body weight loss, and prolongs survival in infected mice. Furthermore, XY018 treatment reduces both viral replication and inflammation in the lungs of IAV-infected mice. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how IAV infection upregulates cholesterol biosynthesis to facilitate viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host cholesterol biosynthesis regulation by influenza virus infection and its impact on viral replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Visualizing influenza A virus assembly by in situ cryo-electron tomography.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) forms pleomorphic particles that package eight ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), each carrying a distinct RNA genome segment. vRNPs assemble in the nucleus and undergo selective sorting during Rab11a-mediated trafficking to the plasma membrane. Virion assembly is orchestrated by matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms a layer beneath the viral envelope containing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, molecular details of vRNP distribution, cytosolic trafficking, and coordination of IAV assembly remains unclear. Using in situ cryo-ET, we reveal that HA-containing membranes provide Rab11a-dependent platforms for membrane-assisted vRNP clustering, reducing inter-vRNP distances. In the absence of HA, vRNPs cluster on NA-containing membranes and virus assembly remains intact, indicating that vRNP clustering and trafficking is membrane-assisted but HA independent. The characteristic 7 + 1 vRNP bundle forms concomitantly with budding and is orchestrated by M1 layer assembly that precedes plasma membrane attachment. We further reveal that intracellular M1 forms multilayered helical assemblies of antiparallel dimers, structurally distinct from the M1 layer in virions. These assemblies are compact in the nucleus but partially dissociate in the cytoplasm, likely serving as a reservoir for budding. Together, our findings uncover membrane-assisted vRNP clustering and molecular details of M1 coordinated influenza virus assembly.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes structural and assembly mechanisms of influenza A virus particles but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of influenza virus replication by artificial proteins (αReps) targeting its RNA-polymerase.
Abstract: Seasonal epidemics and pandemics caused by influenza A viruses still represent a main public health burden in the world. Influenza viruses replicate and transcribe their genome in the nucleus of the infected cells, two functions that are supported by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (FluPol) through extensive structural rearrangements and differential interactions with host cell factors. To get insights into its functioning, we screened a phage-display library of biosynthetic proteins (named αReps and built on a rigid alpha-helicoidal HEAT-like scaffold) against the structurally invariant FluPol core and several flexibly-linked domains of the FluPol PB2 subunit. Several αReps specific of the cap binding domain [CBD], the 627-domain and the NLS domain of PB2 displayed FluPol inhibitory and virus neutralization activities when transiently expressed in the cytosol. Furthermore, intracellular ectopic inducible expression of the αReps C3 and F3 (specific of the CBD and the 627-domain, respectively) in influenza virus permissive cells blocked multiplication of viruses representative of the H1N1, H3N2 and H7N1 subtypes, even when induced at late times post-infection. Bispecific αReps constructs (C3-F3 and F3-C3) display a higher FluPol inhibitory activity than their monomeric counterparts. These results suggest that interfering with FluPol structural rearrangements may represent a promising strategy to block virus multiplication and to design new types of antivirals such as dual binders targeting distant sites on FluPol. Furthermore, we found that the 627-domain constitutes a new possible target for engineering influenza antivirals.

Title: Quantitative analysis of proteomic changes in two monoclonal suspension MDCK cell lines infected with human influenza A virus (H1N1).
Abstract: Suspension MDCK cells are a substrate for producing influenza A virus (IAV) and typically show very high virus yields compared to other animal cells. Due to the significant heterogeneity within cell populations, studying and comparing clonal cell lines with regard to specific properties, such as superior growth or higher productivity, could facilitate process optimization. In this study, we analyzed the expressed proteins of two clonal cell lines to identify intrinsic characteristics of effective IAV producers. We compared proteome changes in two human IAV PR8 (H1N1, A/PR/8/34) infected monoclonal suspension MDCK cell lines: C59, a low-yield IAV producer with fast cell growth and small cell diameter, and C113, a high-yield IAV producer with average cell growth and large cell diameter. We examined growth rate, size, metabolism and IAV production. A total of 5177 host cell proteins were detected in both cell lines using DIA-PASEF mode with a TimsTOFpro mass spectrometer. Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that fatty acid oxidation and branched-chain amino acid degradation were upregulated in highly productive cells. In contrast, steroid biosynthesis and DNA replication were more active in faster-growing cells. Following infection, 122 proteins were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05, log2-fold change ≥1) in the high-producing cell line. These proteins were associated with membrane trafficking, interactions with the IAV-NS1 protein and virus production. Additionally, 98 proteins associated with antiviral pathways such as the proto-oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase MET and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling were downregulated (p < 0.05, log2-fold change ≤1). In the cell line that produced lower IAV PR8 titers, 77 proteins were downregulated and 57 were upregulated after infection. RNA metabolism appeared to be downregulated, while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the stress response were both upregulated. In the high-yield C113 clone, only proteins associated with apoptosis and the target of rapamycin kinase (TOR) were expressed following infection. This may indicate a more effective release of virus particles. A comparison of intracellular IAV PR8 protein levels demonstrated that M1 and NA levels were 4-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, for the high-yield C113 cell line. These findings again suggest an improved virus release.

Title: Human bocavirus NP1 antagonizes host type I interferon response through repressing the nuclear transport of STAT1.
Abstract: Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), first identified in human nasopharyngeal specimens in 2005, is a relatively recent member of the respiratory virus family and is primarily associated with respiratory tract infections. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying HBoV1 pathogenesis remain poorly understood, primarily due to the lack of suitable cell lines and animal models, as well as the complicating factor of co-infections with other pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate that the non-structural protein 1 (NP1) of HBoV1 antagonizes the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway. NP1 interacts with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and the importing β-binding (IBB) domain of karyopherin subunit alpha-1 (KPNA1), thereby disrupting the formation of the STAT1/KPNA1/KPNB1 complex and subsequently inhibiting STAT1 nuclear translocation, a critical step in IFN-I signaling. Furthermore, we show that HBoV1 NP1 facilitates the replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which bocavirus proteins antagonize the host's innate immune response and provide new evidence that bocavirus may exacerbate the symptoms of clinical respiratory viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on how human bocavirus NP1 protein antagonizes host immune response and facilitates replication of other viruses, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A chicken lncRNA is identified as a critical regulator that increases influenza virus replication by impairing innate antiviral responses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant global health threat to both humans and animals. Increasing evidence highlights long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as critical regulators of various physiological and pathological processes, but their roles in virus‒host interactions in chickens remain elusive. This study identified chicken lncRNAs and further investigated their functional involvement in IAV-host interactions. Transcriptome sequencing of chicken DF-1 cells revealed that 2118 lncRNAs were differentially expressed following H9N2 avian influenza virus infection. Among these, a lncRNA that we named lncRNA-up4 was significantly upregulated by H9N2 infection. LncRNA-up4 was predominantly localized in the nucleus but also detected in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we found that the virus-induced expression of lncRNA-up4 was regulated by the pattern recognition receptor-dependent NF-κB signalling pathway. Functional analysis demonstrated that silencing lncRNA-up4 impaired IAV replication by upregulating the expression of several critical antiviral molecules, including IFN-β, MX1, and OAS-1. Conversely, overexpression of lncRNA-up4 increased viral replication, as evidenced by increased viral NP protein and virus titers. Moreover, we observed that lncRNA-up4 positively regulated the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β but suppressed the expression of IFN-β at the mRNA level. These results reveal that the newly identified lncRNA-up4 plays an important role in influenza virus replication through the regulation of cytokine production and antiviral gene expression in chicken cells. This study provides valuable insight into the regulatory function of chicken lncRNAs in innate immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study identifies a chicken lncRNA regulating influenza virus replication via host antiviral responses, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A vaccine central in A(H5) influenza antigenic space confers broad immunity.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) viruses globally impact wild and domestic birds, and have caused severe infections in mammals, including humans, underscoring their pandemic potential<sup>1-5</sup>. The antigenic evolution of the A(H5) haemagglutinin (HA) poses challenges for pandemic preparedness and vaccine design<sup>6</sup>. Here the global antigenic evolution of the A(H5) HA was captured in a high-resolution antigenic map. The map was used to design immunogenic and antigenically central vaccine HA antigens, eliciting antibody responses that broadly cover the A(H5) antigenic space. In ferrets, a central antigen protected as well as homologous vaccines against heterologous infection with two antigenically distinct viruses. This work showcases the rational design of subtype-wide influenza A(H5) pre-pandemic vaccines and demonstrates the value of antigenic maps for the evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses through antibody profiles.

Title: CD26 acts as a host restriction factor to inhibit Influenza A virus (H1N1) infection.
Abstract: The frequent mutations and emerging drug resistance of Influenza A virus (IAV) pose a persistent global health challenge. The identification of host restriction factors that can inhibit viral infection is crucial for the development of novel antiviral therapies. CD26 acts as a host restriction factor in inhibiting H1N1 infection and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our findings collectively demonstrate that CD26 inhibits H1N1 infection. In vitro, soluble CD26 (2.5 μg/ml) reduces H1N1 titers, specifically suppresses IL-6 upregulation in H1N1-infected A549 cells via NF-κB/IRF3/STAT1 signaling, and dose-dependently inhibits viral hemagglutinin (HA) expression. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays confirm direct binding between sCD26 and H1N1 HA with a dissociation constant of 616 nM, while confocal microscopy demonstrates their colocalization, supporting the interaction. As compared with H1N1-infected Wild-Type mice, H1N1-infected CD26 knockout mice showed uncontrolled viral spread, more severe lung pathology, altered lung immune cell proportions, and elevated CXCL2/IL-1β/IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Overall, this study identifies CD26 as a host restriction factor against H1N1, thereby providing a potential therapeutic avenue for managing influenza-induced lung complications.

Title: Feline high pathogenicity avian influenza H5N1 infection: past and present.
Abstract: Since 2020, the emergence and global dissemination of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b infection has had devastating effects in wild and domestic bird populations, and resulted in spillover events in many terrestrial and marine mammalian species, including susceptible captive big cat collections, and feral and domestic feline species. The recent outbreaks in dairy herds in the USA following proposed exposure to infection from wild birds, with subsequent spread to in-contact mammals, demonstrates successful interspecies transmission of this virus and warrants close monitoring.

Title: Bioluminescent reporter influenza A viruses to track viral infections.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) infect a wide range of mammalian and bird species and are responsible for seasonal outbreaks and occasional pandemics of great consequences in humans. Studying IAVs requires methods to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells or animal models. Recombinant IAV-expressing fluorescent proteins has allowed monitoring of viral infection in cultured cells and <i>ex vivo</i> in the organs of infected animals. However, fluorescent-expressing IAVs are often attenuated and are not suited for the imaging of infected animals using <i>in vivo</i> imaging systems (IVISs). To overcome this limitation, we generated a recombinant pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (pH1N1)-expressing nanoluciferase (Nluc) from the non-structural viral segment, hereafter referred to as pH1N1-Nluc. The pH1N1-Nluc replicates efficiently <i>in vitro</i>, with growth kinetics and plaque morphology comparable to wild-type pH1N1 (pH1N1-WT). We used this pH1N1-Nluc to demonstrate its ability to effectively identify neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and antivirals, with neutralization and inhibition results comparable to pH1N1-WT. In mice, pH1N1-Nluc was able to induce similar body weight loss and mortality, and viral titers comparable to pH1N1-WT, results that were also recapitulated in a ferret model of IAV infection. Using IVIS, pH1N1-Nluc enabled non-invasive, real-time tracking of viral infection <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> following infection of mice with viral titers in tissues comparable to pH1N1-WT. The flexibility of this approach was further demonstrated by the generation of a Nluc-expressing recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8-Nluc). Altogether, our results demonstrate that Nluc-expressing recombinant IAVs represent a valuable tool for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, including the identification of antivirals and/or neutralizing antibodies, and to assess the protective efficacy of vaccines.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a threat to human and animal health. Mechanisms that control IAV replication and pathogenesis are incompletely understood due to the lack of experimental approaches to visualize and quantify viral dynamics in real time. The use of replication-competent fluorescent-expressing IAV <i>in vivo</i> has been challenging because such viruses typically have reduced replication fitness and are not suited for imaging of entire animals. Herein, we developed replication-competent recombinant IAV-expressing nanoluciferase (Nluc) that can be used to visualize viral infection in living animals. Infection with Nluc-expressing IAV could be monitored in real time using <i>in vivo</i> imaging systems. Importantly, the Nluc reporter overcomes several shortcomings of fluorescent proteins and provides a new and sensitive tool to interrogate viral dynamics and immune responses <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This technology can be applied to advance studies and accelerate the development of new prophylactics and therapeutics against IAV.

Title: Role of Atypical MAPK p38 Signaling in the Progression of Influenza A-Induced Acute Lung Injury.
Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 plays a key role in driving the pathology of acute lung injury (ALI), but effective therapeutic targeting remains elusive. Atypical p38 signaling, mediated by interaction with the adaptor protein Tumor Growth Factor β Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1) Binding Protein 1 (TAB1), has so far only been observed during pathological responses, representing a selective and alternative target during pulmonary injury. However, atypical signaling has not been investigated in the context of pulmonary injury and immune responses related to the onset and progression of ALI. Here, we utilized a genetic knock-in mouse to block influenza A-induced lung injury mediated by atypical signaling. We report that the loss of TAB1-p38 interaction reduces weight loss and recovery time, reduces histopathological scores associated with influenza-induced lung injury early during infection, and prompts earlier recruitment of monocytes to the lungs following infection. These results were found to be independent of viral replication and infectivity, representing the first evidence for the roles of atypical signaling as a driver of host-mediated pulmonary injury following influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host signaling pathways (MAPK p38) in influenza-induced lung injury, focusing on host response and pathology rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Swine influenza-modified pulmonary microbiota.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a major health concern in both humans and animals, with pigs serving as key reservoirs for generating novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential. Respiratory microbiome alterations during infection may facilitate secondary bacterial complications. This study investigates the lung microbiota of pigs naturally infected with IAV across different regions in Spain, using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize associated bacterial communities. Our results show a higher bacterial genus diversity in IAV-infected animals compared to healthy controls, with significant differences in both presence and relative abundance of bacterial taxa. Infected lungs exhibited increased proportions of potential pathogens, particularly <i>Glaesserella</i> spp., detected in approximately 60% of infected samples, often as the dominant genus. Other pathogenic genera, including <i>Pasteurella</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Mycoplasma</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium</i>, were also strongly associated with infection. Clustering analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles that clearly separated infected from non-infected animals, identifying specific bacterial signatures predictive of infection status. These findings suggest that IAV infection significantly alters the pulmonary microbiota, potentially creating a permissive environment for secondary bacterial infections. This study underscores the relevance of microbiota shifts during IAV infection in swine and highlights the importance of understanding microbial dynamics in respiratory disease progression. Additionally, we present a novel, rapid, and practical experimental pipeline based on ONT long-read sequencing to investigate the respiratory microbiota in swine infection models. This approach offers a valuable tool for future research and potential diagnostic applications in both veterinary and human medicine.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on changes in pulmonary microbiota associated with swine influenza infection, emphasizing host microbiome alterations rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 knockout leads to increased viral propagation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza virus in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and A549 cells: implications in cancer therapy.
Abstract: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) remains a significant global health burden, particularly affecting young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients. The antiapoptotic protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is rapidly upregulated following RSV infection; however, its functional significance in viral pathogenesis remains poorly defined. We investigated the role of Mcl-1 during RSV infection using Mcl-1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (ΔMcl-1 MEFs) and human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells subjected to small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Mcl-1 knockdown. Viral replication was quantified by plaque assays, and phenotypic effects were assessed through syncytia formation and apoptosis assays. To assess broader implications, influenza A virus replication was also evaluated in ΔMcl-1 MEFs and Mcl-1-silenced A549 cells. RSV replication was significantly enhanced in ΔMcl-1 MEFs compared to wild-type (WT) controls, with increased viral titers, larger syncytia formation, and elevated apoptosis during the late stages of infection. Consistent results were observed in A549 cells following Mcl-1 knockdown, where RSV titers increased by more than 3 log₁₀. Influenza A virus replication was also markedly elevated in ΔMcl-1 MEFs and siRNA-treated A549 cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 exerts a broad antiviral effect across multiple respiratory viruses. These findings indicate that Mcl-1 upregulation during RSV and influenza virus infection functions as a critical host antiviral defense mechanism, rather than a viral evasion strategy. Clinically, our results raise concerns regarding therapies that target Mcl-1, such as certain anticancer treatments, which may inadvertently increase susceptibility to severe viral infections. Careful monitoring and potential prophylactic antiviral interventions may be warranted in patients receiving Mcl-1 inhibitor therapies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host protein Mcl-1's role in viral replication and pathogenesis but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Betrixaban is a broad anti-virus inhibitor by activating innate immunity.
Abstract: The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against viral infections. Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, in particular, plays a crucial role in mediating antiviral immunity. Here, we identify Betrixaban (BT), a novel small-molecule compound that activates innate immune responses, leading to broad-spectrum antiviral effects. BT induces IFN-β production and upregulates interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), effectively suppressing the replication of multiple viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and influenza A virus (IAV). BT's antiviral activity relies on innate immune activation, with IRF3 playing a key role. The antiviral effect was significantly reduced upon loss of ISGs induction, including Mx1 and Mx2. <i>In vivo</i>, BT treatment markedly induced IFNB1 expression across multiple mouse tissues and significantly inhibited viral replication in VSV-infected wild-type mice, confirming the essential role of innate antiviral immune activation. These findings establish BT as a potent stimulator of the innate immune system, demonstrating broad-spectrum antiviral potential and highlighting its promise as a therapeutic agent.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a host-targeting antiviral compound activating innate immunity, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Lung cell fates during influenza.
Abstract: Roughly 1 billion people are infected by Influenza A viruses (IAVs) worldwide each year, resulting in approximately half a million deaths. Particularly concerning is the threat of IAV spillover from avian and other animal reservoirs. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in US dairy cows highlights this concern. While viruses that enter human populations from such zoonotic transmission typically lack the ability to transmit effectively between humans, they may be only a few mutations from acquiring this capacity. These newly adapted viruses have the potential to be significantly more virulent than seasonal strains. A major contributor to influenza pathology is the over-exuberant immune response to the virus, particularly when the infection is present in distal pulmonary tissues. Maladaptive immune pathway over-activation can drive tissue damage and pathology, often independently of effective viral control. Anti-inflammatories targeting host-initiated pathological processes hold promise, but these avenues require a thorough understanding of virus-triggered lung inflammation before they can be fully exploited. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the cell types that are targeted by IAV, the consequences of IAV infection on the biology of these cells, and their contribution to lung pathology in influenza. We will also discuss how virus-induced hyper-inflammatory responses present new entry-points for therapeutic intervention, showcasing Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated necroptosis as an example of one such pathway.

Title: Revealing Reassortment in Influenza A Viruses with TreeSort.
Abstract: Reassortment among influenza A viruses (IAV) facilitates evolution and has been associated with interspecies transmission and pandemics. We introduce a novel tool called TreeSort that accurately identifies recent and ancestral reassortment events on datasets with thousands of IAV whole genomes. TreeSort uses the phylogeny of a selected IAV segment as a reference and finds the branches on the phylogeny where reassortment has occurred with high probability. The tool reports the particular gene segments that were involved in reassortment and how different they are from prior gene pairings. Using TreeSort, we studied reassortment patterns of different IAV subtypes isolated in avian, swine, and human hosts. Avian IAV demonstrated more reassortment than human and swine IAV, with the avian H7 subtype displaying the most frequent reassortment. Reassortment in the swine and human H3 subtypes was more frequent than in the swine and human H1 subtypes, respectively. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b had elevated reassortment rates in the 2020 to 2023 period; however, the surface protein-encoding genes (HA, NA, and MP) co-evolved together with almost no reassortment among these genes. We observed similar co-evolutionary patterns with very low rates of reassortment among the surface proteins for the human H1 and H3 lineages, suggesting that strong co-evolution and preferential pairings among surface proteins are a consequence of high viral fitness. Our algorithm enables real-time tracking of IAV reassortment within and across different hosts and can identify novel viruses for pandemic risk assessment. TreeSort is available at https://github.com/flu-crew/TreeSort.

Reason: The paper focuses on detecting reassortment events using phylogenetic methods but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza viruses in the Izumi plain reveals the role of wild ducks in the introduction of H5N1 HPAIVs during the 2023/24 winter season.
Abstract: The Izumi plain, located in the southern part of Japan, serves as a major overwintering site for endangered crane species, including the hooded crane (Grus monacha) and the white-naped crane (Grus vipio). Since the 2012/13 winter season, continuous surveillance of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in environmental water and wild birds has been conducted in this region. During the 2023/24 winter season, 45 isolates of H5N1 high pathogenicity AIVs (HPAIVs) and 24 isolates of low pathogenicity AIVs (LPAIVs) were obtained at different time points from crane roost water. Additionally, H5N1 HPAIVs were detected in four wild ducks in November 2023 and in eight cranes in December 2023. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all H5N1 HPAIVs belonged to subclade G2d of clade 2.3.4.4b, with early winter isolates-particularly those from wild ducks and roost water-occupying more ancestral phylogenetic positions. These findings suggest that wild ducks likely introduced HPAIVs into the overwintering site. Genotype analysis based on the genetic constellations of all eight gene segments indicated the co-introduction of multiple HPAIV genotypes into the Izumi plain and suggested bidirectional gene segment exchange between HPAIVs and LPAIVs. Hemagglutination inhibition assays detected no H5 HA-specific antibodies in six overwintering cranes, implying a limited role for cranes in virus dissemination. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of continued virological surveillance and genetic monitoring of AIVs at major overwintering sites, where close ecological interactions between wild ducks and cranes facilitate cross-species transmission.

Title: Novel influenza A(H1N2) seasonal reassortant virus identified in a patient, Sweden, April 2025.
Abstract: In April 2025, a human seasonal reassortant influenza A(H1N2) virus with a 7:1 genetic constellation was detected in Sweden in a patient seeking primary care for influenza-like illness. The neuraminidase gene of this virus was from A(H3N2) and the remaining genes from A(H1N1)pdm09. The patient recovered. No additional cases have been detected through routine surveillance. This is so far the only identified A(H1N2) reassortant among three seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) reassortants reported in GISAID from Europe during the 2024/25 season.

Title: Atypical Influenza A(H3N2) Activity Patterns in Germany, 2021-2023, and Characterization of Newly Emerged Virus Clades.
Abstract: The first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic were accompanied by an unprecedented decrease of influenza activity which persisted throughout the 2020/21 and 2021/22 winter seasons. Here, we report on the unusual influenza circulation patterns that followed in the year 2022, which was dominated throughout by A(H3N2) influenza viruses. After a delayed spring wave in 2022, A(H3N2) influenza viruses circulated at low levels throughout the summer and rose to a prominent, prematurely-timed fall/winter wave peaking in December, with highest positivity rates observed in 10-12-years old children. This winter wave ended abruptly with the national school holidays, when positivity rates decreased sharply not only in children but also in other age groups. Genetic analysis of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) showed cocirculation of 10 A(H3N2) clades, of which three (2a.1b, 2a.3a.1, and 2b) became dominant in late 2022. All A(H3N2) viruses, including those assigned to the new clades, displayed high titers in HA inhibition tests with postinfection ferret antiserum raised against the A(H3N2) vaccine strains A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 and A/Darwin/9/2021. All viruses were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors and the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, but carried the M2-S31N substitution conferring adamantane resistance. Our findings shed light on disturbed seasonality of A(H3N2) circulation in the post-COVID-19 era.

Title: An intranasal quadruple variant vaccine approach using SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A: Delta, Omicron, H1N1and H3N2.
Abstract: Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are both responsible for respiratory tract infections that have caused global outbreaks. Due to frequent mutations, the CDC recommends annual COVID-19 vaccination (CDC Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines, 2025), and studies confirm the safety of co-administering it with the flu shot (CDC Getting a Flu Vaccine and Other Recommended Vaccines at the Same Time, 2025). A combination vaccine streamlines dual immunization, reducing the need for separate vaccinations. This study evaluates the immune response elicited by an intranasal microparticulate combination multivalent vaccine for Influenza and COVID-19. The intranasal route can generate mucosal antibodies that recognize and inhibit the virus at its point of entry. The nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, consisting of circulating immune cells that drain into lymphatic circulation to generate a systemic immune response. This non-invasive route of administration can also significantly benefit patients with needle phobia and vaccine hesitancy. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants, along with the H1N1 and H3N2 variants of Influenza A were encapsulated into separate PLGA (co-polymer of lactic and glycolic acids) microparticle matrices utilizing a double emulsion method. The adjuvanted vaccine microparticles were administered to mice as one primary vaccination followed by one booster dose via the intranasal route. Serum and lung supernatant analysis revealed significantly higher antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses than controls. Isolated lymph nodes and spleens showed increased cytotoxic and helper T-cell activation. The intranasal vaccine effectively elicited a significant immune response which was comparable in relation to the intramuscular control vaccination. This supports the potential of an intranasal microparticulate combination vaccine as an effective, needle-free alternative for simultaneous immunization for Influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

Title: A bacteria-based search for drugs against avian and swine flu yields a potent and resistance-resilient channel blocker.
Abstract: Influenza represents a significant threat with seasonal epidemics that can transition to global pandemics, and cross-species infection presenting a continuous challenge. While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus's validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure-activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus's channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo's potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.

Title: Nanchangmycin suppresses influenza A virus infection by blocking endosomal acidification.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) constitute a major threat to human and animal health. Currently, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors have been applied clinically as therapeutics against IAVs. However, IAVs possess adaptive mutations to these inhibitors, especially M2 ion channel and NA inhibitors. Thus, novel antiviral agents should be developed. In the present study, we screen approximately 5500 compounds and identify an IAV inhibitor, nanchangmycin, which possesses a robust antiviral activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, it exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity for additional virus infections, including pseudorabies virus, herpes virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Most importantly, it has antiviral activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains in sub-μM ranges and promotes the survival of MDCK cells infected with the oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus strain. Further studies reveal that it blocks the nuclei migration of viral nuclear proteins (NPs), resulting in NP accumulation in the cytoplasm, particularly within perinuclear endosomes. Also, it inhibits IAVs by blocking endosomal acidification. Overall, nanchangmycin has the potential to be developed as an anti-influenza agent.

Title: Evaluation of pandemic potential of the genotype 4 (G4) swine influenza virus using <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> cultures of the human respiratory tract.
Abstract: Recent studies have reported a genotype 4 (G4) reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus in swine, demonstrating a potential pandemic threat in humans. Here, we have compared the tropism, replication competence and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine induction of the two G4 EA H1N1 strains in parallel with 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1/pdm/09) and A/Quail/HK/G1/1997 H9N2 (G1) using <i>ex vivo</i> culture of the human respiratory tract and <i>in vitro</i> culture of human peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Our results showed that G4 strains could replicate in <i>ex vivo</i> cultures of human lung and bronchus with a similar replication competence to H1N1/pdm/09. The cytokine induction levels of G4 were similar to H1N1/pdm/09 in macrophages. Taken together, we could extrapolate that the G4 EA H1N1 swine influenza may pose a notable public health threat towards human and should not underestimate this threat.

Title: A Strand-Specific Quantitative RT-PCR Method for Detecting vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA of H7N9 Avian Influenza Virus in a Mouse Model.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) remains a persistent threat to both the poultry industry and human health. Among the AIV subtypes posing public health threats, H7N9 AIV is responsible for five epidemic waves of human infection in China. Here, a detection system based on a mouse model was established, which can simultaneously and quantitatively analyze the dynamic changes in the viral genomic RNA (vRNA), complementary RNA (cRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) of H7N9 AIV by using reverse transcription primers with tag sequences to reverse transcribe the three species of RNAs into corresponding cDNA templates, which are then absolutely quantified using the TaqMan quantitative PCR method. This system specifically targets the PB2 and NA genes and, for the first time, enables a spatiotemporal analysis of all three viral RNA species within an animal model. Our results revealed that H7N9 AIV exhibits characteristic replication kinetics, with all three species of viral RNAs showing a rapid increase followed by a certain degree of decline. This system offers a powerful tool for us to further advance our understanding of the replication dynamics of AIV in mice.

Title: Repurposing of Some Nucleoside Analogs Targeting Some Key Proteins of the Avian H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b to Combat the Circulating HPAI in Birds: An In Silico Approach.
Abstract: (1) Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is an emerging threat that poses a great risk to the poultry industry. A few human cases have been linked to the infection with this clade in many parts of the world, including the USA. Unfortunately, there are no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs that could help prevent and treat the infection caused by this virus in birds. Our major objective is to identify/repurpose some (novel/known) antiviral compounds that may inhibit viral replication by targeting some key viral proteins. (2) Methods: We used state-of-the-art machine learning tools such as molecular docking and MD-simulation methods from Biovia Discovery Studio (v24.1.0.321712). The key target proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), Matrix-2 protein (M2), and the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PB2/CBD) homology models were validated through structural assessment via DOPE scores, Ramachandran plots, and Verify-3D metrics, ensuring reliable structural representations, confirming their reliability for subsequent in silico approaches. These approaches include molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation for 50 nanoseconds (ns), highlighting the structural stability and compactness of the docked complexes. (3) Results: Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities for both sofosbuvir and GS441524, particularly with the NA and PB2/CBD protein targets. Among them, GS441524 exhibited superior interaction scores and a greater number of hydrogen bonds with key functional residues of NA and PB2/CBD. The MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further supported these findings, as GS441524 displayed more favorable binding energies compared to several known standard inhibitors, including F0045S for HA, Zanamivir for NA, Rimantadine and Amantadine for M2, and PB2-39 for PB2/CBD. Additionally, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the structural stability and compactness of the GS441524-PB2/CBD complex, further supporting its potential as a promising antiviral candidate. Furthermore, hydrogen bond monitor analysis over the 50 ns simulation confirmed persistent and specific interactions between the ligand and proteins, suggesting that GS441524 may effectively inhibit the NA, and PB2/CBD might potentially disrupt PB2-mediated RNA synthesis. (4) Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with previous evidence supporting the antiviral activity of certain nucleoside analog inhibitors, including GS441524, against various coronaviruses. These results further support the potential repurposing of GS441524 as a promising therapeutic candidate against H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b. However, further functional studies are required to validate these in silico predictions and support the inhibitory action of GS441524 against the targeted proteins of H5N1, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b.

Title: Detection of a Novel Gull-like Clade of Newcastle Disease Virus and H3N8 Avian Influenza Virus in the Arctic Region of Russia (Taimyr Peninsula).
Abstract: Wild waterbirds are circulating important RNA viruses, such as avian coronaviruses, avian astroviruses, avian influenza viruses, and avian paramyxoviruses. Waterbird migration routes cover vast territories both within and between continents. The breeding grounds of many species are in the Arctic, but research into this region is rare. This study reports the first Newcastle disease virus (NDV) detection in Arctic Russia. As a result of a five-year study (from 2019 to 2023) of avian paramyxoviruses and avian influenza viruses in wild waterbirds of the Taimyr Peninsula, whole-genome sequences of NDV and H3N8 were obtained. The resulting influenza virus isolate was phylogenetically related to viruses that circulated between 2021 and 2023 in Eurasia, Siberia, and Asia. All NDV sequences were obtained from the Herring gull, and other gull sequences formed a separate gull-like clade in the sub-genotype I.1.2.1, Class II. This may indirectly indicate that different NDV variants adapt to more host species than is commonly believed. Further surveillance of other gull species may help to test the hypothesis of putative gull-specific NDV lineage and better understand their role in the evolution and global spread of NDV.

Title: Phylogenetic and Mutation Analysis of Hemagglutinin Gene from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5 Clade 2.3.4.4b in South America.
Abstract: The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) H5 clade 2.3.4.4b has caused severe outbreaks in domestic and wild birds worldwide since its emergence in 2014, and especially since 2020, with outbreaks in Europe and North America. The introduction of the virus into South America was reported for the first time in Colombia in October 2022, followed by outbreaks in other South American countries affecting poultry, wild birds, mammals, and humans. In this study, a phylogenetic and mutation analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of HPAIV H5N1 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated in South America was performed to analyze its evolution and its transmission and zoonotic potential. The analysis shows an increase in the viral effective population size between April and June 2022, which was followed by multiple outbreaks of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in South America. Moreover, the virus variants evolved from a recent common ancestor estimated to have existed in June 2017. The mean rate of evolution of the HA gene was 6.95 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year, and the sequence analysis of HA identified a mutation (D171N) located at antibody binding sites and viral oligomerization interfaces, with implications for immune response evasion and new host species infection. Additionally, viral strains from South America share the substitutions L104M, T156A, P181S, and V210A, compared to the vaccine strain A/chicken/Ghana/AVL763/2021. Understanding the dynamics of viral evolution and transmission is essential for effective prevention strategies to mitigate future outbreaks.

Title: Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity of Pyridobenzothiazolone Analogues Against Respiratory Viruses.
Abstract: Cell-based phenotypic screening of a privileged in-house library composed of pyridobenzothiazolone (PBTZ) analogues was conducted against representative viruses responsible for common respiratory tract infections in humans, i.e., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus type OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and influenza virus type A (IFV-A). We identified a compound with broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against multiple strains of RSV, HCoV, and IFV, with EC<sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range and cell-independent activity. Its antiviral activity and cytocompatibility were confirmed in a fully differentiated 3D model of the bronchial epithelium mimicking the in vivo setting. The hit compound enters cells and localizes homogeneously in the cytosol, inhibiting replicative phases in a virus-specific manner. Overall, the selected PBTZ represents a good starting point for further preclinical development as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that could address the continuous threat of new emerging pathogens and the rising issue of antiviral resistance.

Title: Phylogeographic Analysis of Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in Serbia Reveals Repeated Introductions and Spread Across the Balkans.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 continues to pose a major threat to animal and public health. Since its emergence, clade 2.3.4.4b has become the dominant global lineage, associated with widespread outbreaks in Europe. This study aimed to characterise the H5N1 strains detected in backyard chickens in Serbia and investigate their phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships with historical and currently circulating strains in Serbia and the broader region. Samples collected in 2024 were tested by qRT-PCR, and positive samples were propagated in MDCK cells. Whole genome sequencing of isolated virus was performed using the MinION Mk1C platform (ONT, Oxford, UK). Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were conducted using BEAST X and SPREAD3 v.9.6. The results revealed three independent introductions of H5N1 into Serbia between 2020 and 2024. The spatiotemporal diffusion patterns confirmed both north-south and west-east viral spread from Northern and Central Europe into the Balkans. Additionally, Serbia was identified as a critical transit and divergence point in the regional transmission network, highlighting its role in the spread of H5N1 between Western and Eastern Europe. These findings underscore the importance of continued genomic surveillance in both domestic and wild bird populations to better understand and reduce HPAI spread.

Title: Emerging highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza triggers fibrotic remodeling in human airway organoids.
Abstract: The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.

Title: Applying Field and Genomic Epidemiology Methods to Investigate Transmission Networks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in Domestic Poultry in British Columbia, Canada (2022-2023).
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A (H5N1) was first detected in North America in 2021. Ongoing spillover events from wild to domestic birds and subsequent transmission between domestic birds resulted in Canada's largest recorded epidemic of HPAI. Between December 2021 and April 2024, 422 A (H5N1) outbreaks in domestic birds were confirmed in Canada. Of these, 158 (37%) occurred in British Columbia (BC). This study integrates field and genomic epidemiology (GE) results to investigate the potential for lateral or local spread between infected poultry farms in BC. Five genetically distinct viral clusters were identified during this period. Among the 31 noncommercial premises, 27 (87.1%) were classified as independent introductions, while four premises (12.9%) were attributed to local spread within 10 km of a phylogenetically connected infected premises (IP). No lateral spread events were identified among noncommercial premises. All infected noncommercial premises housed birds with outdoor access, emphasizing their susceptibility to wild bird exposure. Of the 127 infected commercial poultry premises, 21 (16.5%) were classified as independent introductions, 82 (64.6%) as local spread, 18 (14.2%) with potential for lateral spread, five (3.9%) with potential for both local and/or lateral spread, and one (0.8%) for which sequencing was unavailable. Local spread emerged as a prominent feature, with most IP in proximity to one another having genetically similar viruses. Results suggest that proximity (<200 m) to an IP was a more reliable predictor of future infection status than contact with an IP. These findings underscore the critical value of combining field and GE to understand outbreak dynamics comprehensively. This integrative approach improves resource allocation, informs targeted containment strategies, and supports the need for effective biosecurity measures to mitigate future risks, particularly in densely populated poultry production regions. Robust interventions are needed to address both independent introductions and secondary spread pathways.

Title: Genotype B3.13 influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from dairy cattle demonstrate high virulence in laboratory models, but retain avian virus-like properties.
Abstract: In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses were first detected in U.S. dairy cattle. Similar viruses have since caused 70 zoonotic human infections. To assess changes to zoonotic potential, we characterized A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated from cows' milk and birds. Bovine-derived viruses are lethal in mice and ferrets and transmit to direct but not airborne contact ferrets. All viruses replicate in human bronchial epithelial cells despite preferentially binding avian virus-like receptors. The bovine-derived viruses remain susceptible to FDA-approved antivirals, and they are inhibited by sera from ferrets vaccinated with WHO-recommended candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) or human sera from clade 2.3.4.4c vaccinees. While 2.3.4.4b viruses induce severe disease in mammalian models, they retain many avian virus-like characteristics. Combined, we conclude that the risk of contemporary bovine-derived viruses to humans not in contact with affected animals is low. However, heightened vigilance remains essential to promptly detect and respond to any changes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes bovine-derived H5N1 viruses for virulence and receptor binding but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Anti-influenza activity of Blumea Balsamifera (L.) DC. Extract: In vitro and in vivo evaluation against multiple influenza virus strains.
Abstract: Influenza virus epidemics occur annually, posing significant public health challenges. Although anti-influenza drugs are available, newly emerged viral strains frequently develop resistance, necessitating the discovery of new antiviral reagents. This study aims to evaluate the anti-influenza virus activity of Blumea Balsamifera (L.) DC. Extract (BBE) in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The antiviral activity of BBE was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo assay and the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, targeting influenza virus strains H1N1, H3N2, and four influenza B viruses. Specifically, BBE demonstrated significant inhibition of MDCK cell lesions caused by the A subtypes A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), as well as the B subtypes B/Darwin/58/2019 (Yamagata), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata), B/Sichuan Gaoxin/531/2018 (Victoria), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria). The extract showed inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 8.71, 11.38, 10.14, 4.66, 3.17, and 4.29 μg/mL, respectively. Time-of-drug-addition assay results indicated that BBE inhibits the early stages of influenza virus replication. Additionally, in vivo studies in murine models further confirmed the protective effects of BBE, where it reduced viral-induced weight loss, delayed mortality, and mitigated lung tissue damage. These findings suggest that Blumea Balsamifera (L.) DC. extract holds promise as a potential reagent against influenza viruses and warrants further investigation.

Title: Using homologous network to identify reassortment risk in H5Nx avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: The resurgence of H5Nx reassortment has caused multiple epidemics resulting in severe disease even death in wild birds and poultry. Assessing H5Nx reassortment risk is crucial for designing targeted interventions and enhancing preparedness efforts to manage H5Nx outbreaks effectively. However, the complexity in H5Nx reassortment, driven by the diversity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and wide range of hosts, has hindered the effective quantification of reassortment risk. In this study, we utilized a network approach to explore the reassortment history using a large-scale dataset. By inferring genomic homogeneity among IAVs, we constructed an IAVs homologous network with reassortment history embedded within it. We estimated the communities within the IAVs homologous network to represent the reassortment risk of various viruses, revealing diverse reassortment risks across different H5Nx viruses. Our analysis also identified the primary hosts contributing to reassortment: domestic poultry in China, and wild birds in North America and Europe. These primary hosts are critical targets for future H5Nx reassortment interventions. Our study provides a framework for quantifying and ranking H5Nx reassortment risk, contributing to enhanced preparedness and prevention efforts.

Title: The mechanism of action in Mussaenda pubescens (Yuye Jinhua) against influenza A virus: Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is recognized as a predominant etiological agent responsible for severe contagious diseases in both humans and animals, characterized by elevated pathogenicity and mortality rates. Mussaenda pubescens (Yuye Jinhua, YYJH), a traditional medicinal herb known for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties, has been predominantly utilized in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities to manage influenza virus infections. However, the standalone therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of YYJH against IAV infection remain insufficiently clarified. This study sought to elucidate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of YYJH through both in vivo and in vitro investigations, thereby unveiling its potential mechanisms in mitigating IAV-induced pulmonary injury. In vitro assessments encompassed the evaluation of cytotoxicity, optimal administration strategies, and antiviral efficacy of YYJH against IAV utilizing the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. In vivo experiments included monitoring changes in body weight, survival rates, lung index, histopathological alterations, viral replication levels, serum inflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte subsets to appraise the protective effects of YYJH in IAV-infected murine models. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) analysis, integrated with network pharmacology, was employed to identify probable molecular targets and enriched signaling pathways associated with YYJH's anti-influenza activity. The modulation of key proteins participating in the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling cascade, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and phospho-NF-κB (p-NF-κB), was subsequently verified through Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis. YYJH exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, with CC<sub>50</sub> values determined as 42.83 mg/ml for MDCK cells and 36.34 mg/ml for A549 cells. In MDCK cell-based assays, YYJH demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of viral progeny production, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis. The CCK-8 assay further confirmed YYJH's significant inhibitory effects across various stages of the influenza viral replication cycle, including pre-infection, post-infection, and co-infection phases. In vivo, YYJH administration (12.34 g/kg/d) markedly extended the survival duration of infected mice, notably reduced mortality rates, suppressed viral replication, decreased lung index values, and ameliorated histopathological damage within pulmonary tissues. Moreover, YYJH effectively downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, upregulated IFN-γ, in both A549 cell models and infected mice, while simultaneously enhancing T-lymphocyte subset profiles in viral pneumonia conditions. A sum of 37 bioactive compounds were identified through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Based on 55 identified components via HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and database predictions, network pharmacology analyses pinpointed the TLR-MyD88/NF-κB pathway as the pivotal signaling cascade mediating YYJH's antiviral effects. Subsequent validation by WB and immunofluorescence corroborated YYJH's regulatory influence on TLR/MyD88/NF-κB pathway-associated proteins in lung tissues. Collectively, these observations underscore the antiviral potential of YYJH, evidenced by its capacity to ameliorate pulmonary histopathological alterations and restore immune homeostasis, with its mechanistic actions likely mediated through the modulation of the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling cascade.

Title: Multidisciplinary Tracking of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak in Griffon Vultures, Southern Europe, 2022.
Abstract: Since 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus has affected wild bird populations globally. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), a species hitherto considered unexposed, experienced an HPAI H5N1 outbreak in 2022 in southern Europe, leading to moderate mortality and reduced breeding success. The integration of virological, serologic, phylogenetic, and ecologic data revealed a short yet intense viral circulation and a probable common source of infection. The dissemination across Spain and France was likely caused by frequent interpopulation movements of birds. This integrated overview of the 2022 HPAI outbreak in vultures provides novel insights into the role of large-scale movements of wild birds in the spread of such disease. Understanding the epidemiologic dynamics of HPAI H5N1 in these scavenger species is crucial because the birds play vital roles in ecosystem functioning. Their susceptibility to this virus highlights potential broader ecologic effects of the ongoing outbreaks.

Title: Transmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) Viruses in Wild Birds, South Korea, 2023-2024.
Abstract: We analyzed 15 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus infections detected in wild birds in South Korea during September 2023-March 2024. We isolated and sequenced 8 H5N1 and 7 H5N6 viruses. We investigated spatiotemporal transmission dynamics by using a Bayesian discrete trait phylodynamic model that incorporated geographic and host species information. Our source-sink dynamics support introductions of H5N1 viruses from northern Japan to South Korea and subsequent spread through multiple regions in South Korea. The H5N6 viruses were most likely introduced into southwestern South Korea and spread northeastward. Wild waterfowl, especially wild ducks, played a key role in transmission of both H5N1 and H5N6 viruses. Our data showed multiple introductions and extensive spread of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b viruses and bidirectional transmission between Japan and South Korea. Our results highlight the value of enhanced active surveillance for monitoring HPAI viruses, which can provide insight into preventing future outbreaks.

Title: Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the North American A(H5N1) outbreak reveals successive lineage replacements by descendant reassortants.
Abstract: The November 2021 introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b into North America triggered a devastating outbreak, affecting more than 180 million domestic birds and spreading to more than 80 wildlife species across Canada and the US. From this outbreak, we have sequenced 2955 complete A(H5N1) viral genomes from samples collected in Canada and, in conjunction with previously published data, performed multifaceted phylodynamic analyses. These analyses reveal extensive diversification of A(H5N1) viruses via reassortment with low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We find evidence of repeated ancestral strain replacement by direct descendants, indicative of compounding viral fitness increases. Spatiotemporal modeling identified critical geographic areas facilitating transcontinental spread and demonstrated genotype-specific host dynamics, offering essential data for ongoing control and prevention strategies.

Title: Mitochondrial dysfunction enhances influenza pathogenesis by up-regulating de novo sialic acid biosynthesis.
Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger metabolic adaptations that resemble those induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we show that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, modeled by <i>Ndufs4</i> deficiency, reprograms lung epithelial metabolism to promote IAV pathogenesis. In both <i>Ndufs4</i> knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. In <i>Ndufs4</i> KO models, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses in <i>Ndufs4</i> KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic.

Title: Host cellular protein RAB33B facilitates influenza viral replication and modulates M2 trafficking by enhancing autophagy.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a major global health threat. Its M2 protein plays crucial roles in viral fusion, transportation, assembly, and release. Recent studies have shown that IAV impairs host autophagy flux to enhance viral replication. However, the precise mechanisms by which IAV M2 manipulates host cellular autophagy during virus replication remain unclear. In this study, we analysed cellular transcriptional responses of cells to IAV M2 overexpression and identified RAB GTPase protein RAB33B as a key factor. RAB33B was significantly up-regulated by IAV M2 and promoted IAV replication by enhancing autophagy. We further found that autophagy regulates the interaction of IAV M2, RAB33B, and LC3, facilitating M2 membrane trafficking through autophagic-like vesicles. In addition, ATG16L1 (an effector of RAB33B) and TBC1D25 (a GTPase-activating protein for RAB33B) contributed to IAV M2-induced autophagy, thereby affecting viral replication. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism in which RAB33B is essential for IAV M2 trafficking to the plasma membrane, facilitating viral replication through enhanced autophagy. These insights shed new light on the autophagy-based cellular transport mechanisms of IAV M2 and highlight potential antiviral targets.

Title: Inhibitory effects of a hot-water extract of cumin fruit on influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) is an extremely contagious virus responsible for both seasonal flu and global pandemics. Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L., family Apiaceae) is a spice widely used in numerous Asian nations. The cumin fruit, commonly termed 'cumin seed', has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments; however, its effect on IAV is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of cumin fruit hot-water extract (CWE) on IAV infection. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with IAV (H1N1) and used for in vitro experiments. Pre-infection treatment of the target cells with CWE suppressed M1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas post-infection treatment had no such effect. CWE at concentrations of 12.5 µg/mL or higher also inhibited IAV-induced haemagglutination and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Even, a plaque formation assay was also conducted to confirm the efficacy of CWE on virus replication. The assay results showed that CWE significantly reduced IAV replication. However, the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated antiviral protein genes was not affected by CWE in the virus-infected cells. Furthermore, the presence of cuminaldehyde in CWE was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Cuminaldehyde was not detected in the CWE used in this study. Moreover, cells that were pre-treated with a cuminaldehyde standard did not show any inhibition of IAV infection. The current in vitro study showed that CWE inhibited IAV infection without harming host cells. Thus, CWE may be used to prevent IAV infections by limiting viral attachment and absorption.

Title: A branched peptide targets virus and host to block influenza virus and rhinovirus entry.
Abstract: The global burden of influenza virus and rhinovirus, along with significant mortality and severe case reports, underscores the urgent need for new antivirals. Human defensins serve as the first line of defense against viruses; however, the antiviral activity of defensin peptides is often sensitive to salt, which affects their effectiveness. This study investigates a branched human-defensin peptide H30 (4H30) that can more effectively inhibit influenza virus and rhinovirus compared to the linear form of H30. Mechanistic studies reveal that 4H30 binds to influenza HA to aggregate the virus, thereby blocking viral entry. 4H30 can also cross-link H1N1 virus with cell surface glycosaminoglycans to prevent viral release. The dual-functional peptide 4H30 protects mice from the lethal challenge of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, demonstrating a high barrier to viral resistance after 15 viral-culture passages in the presence of 4H30. Notably, 4H30 interferes with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to impede the entry of minor group rhinovirus and significantly inhibits rhinovirus replication in RD cells, nasal organoids, and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that the branched peptide 4H30, targeting both the virus and host, can more effectively inhibit influenza and rhinovirus than the linear H30, providing a new avenue for antiviral peptide development.

Title: Efficacy of baloxavir marboxil against bovine H5N1 virus in mice.
Abstract: Since the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) in U.S. dairy cattle in early 2024, the virus has spread rapidly, posing a major public health concern as the number of human cases continues to rise. Although human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed, experimental data suggest that the bovine H5N1 virus can transmit via respiratory droplets in ferrets, highlighting its pandemic potential. With no vaccines currently available, antiviral drugs remain the only treatment option. Here, we investigate the efficacy of the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (BXM) against this virus in mice. We find that early treatment post-infection is effective, but delayed treatment significantly reduces BXM efficacy and increases the risk of BXM resistance, underscoring the importance of timely BXM administration for effective treatment.

Title: Amplicon sequencing of pasteurized retail dairy enables genomic surveillance of H5N1 avian influenza virus in United States cattle.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses with H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (clade 2.3.4.4b) are causing an ongoing panzootic in wild birds. Circulation of these viruses is associated with spillover infections in multiple species of mammals, including a large, unprecedented outbreak in American dairy cattle. Before widespread on-farm testing, there was an unmet need for genomic surveillance. Infected cattle can shed high amounts of HPAI H5N1 viruses in milk, allowing detection in pasteurized retail dairy samples. Over a 2-month sampling period in one Midwestern city, we obtained dairy products processed in 20 different states. Here we demonstrate that a tiled-amplicon sequencing approach produced over 90% genome coverage at greater than 20x depth from 5 of 13 viral RNA positive samples, with higher viral copies corresponding to better sequencing success. The sequences clustered phylogenetically within the rest of the cattle outbreak sequences reported. A combination of RT-qPCR testing and sequencing from retail dairy products can be a useful component of a One Health framework for responding to the avian influenza outbreak in cattle.

Title: Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Styrene Maleic-Acid Copolymer Lipid Particle Nanodiscs for pH-Responsive Irreversible Virus Inactivation.
Abstract: Respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, continue to pose significant global health challenges. Current antivirals, which are often specific to a single virus, face limitations due to rapid mutations and the emergence of new strains. In this study, we introduce styrene maleic acid copolymer lipid particle nanodiscs (SMALP-NDs) as a broad-spectrum antiviral platform that employs a dual mode of action. First, SMALP-NDs bind to positively charged viral proteins via their negatively charged surfaces, thereby blocking viral entry. Second, they induce the collapse of viral envelopes under acidic conditions similar to those in the endosome, leading to virus inactivation via a cell-mediated mechanism. SMALP-NDs demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against influenza A/B and multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron JN.1, as well as herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and vaccinia virus, underscoring their versatility. Intranasal administration of SMALP-NDs has successfully protected mice from lethal H1N1 and H5N2 influenza A viruses as well as SARS-CoV-2. These findings underscore that SMALP-NDs effectively counteract the increasing positive charge of emerging viral proteins through their negatively charged surfaces while leveraging pH-responsive virus inactivation mechanisms to achieve high antiviral efficacy with low toxicity, offering a significant advantage over traditional antiviral nanomaterials.

Title: Antiviral effects of heme oxygenase-1 against canine coronavirus and canine influenza virus in vitro.
Abstract: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Emerging evidence shows that HO-1 also exhibits antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and Ebola virus. Its antiviral effects are mediated not only by its enzymatic function but also through the modulation of interferon-related pathways, thereby inhibiting viral replication. In this study, we investigated the antiviral effects of HO-1 on canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 using cell-based assays. To determine whether HO-1 suppresses CCoV and CIV, cells were treated with hemin to induce HO-1 expression. Hemin treatment successfully induced HO-1 expression in A72 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, resulting in the suppression of CCoV and CIV replication. The canine HO-1 gene was cloned into an expression vector and transfected into cells to achieve transient overexpression. Recombinant canine HO-1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using an expression vector. HO-1 overexpression suppressed CCoV and CIV replication in cells. Following viral infection, treatment with purified HO-1 protein led to a reduction in viral protein levels. Therefore, both HO-1 expression and exogenous protein treatment effectively inhibited CCoV and CIV replication. Elevated HO-1 protein levels consistently reduced viral RNA and protein expression in vitro. These findings suggest that HO-1 could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for managing viral infections in dogs.

Title: A genome-wide base-editing screen uncovers a pivotal role of paxillin δ ubiquitination in influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Dissecting host factors critical for viral infection and understanding their mechanisms of action is critical for identifying drug targets. Here, we leverage a genome-wide CRISPR base-editing screen to identify functional lysine residues in host factors required for influenza A virus (IAV) replication. Multiple host genes, including GSTM4, FLNC, HMGB1, ZNF236, GRIP1, and PXN, along with regulatory lysine codons, are identified. Among these, paxillin (encoded by PXN) is identified as an important host entry factor. Depletion of paxillin significantly reduces IAV infection in both cell cultures and mice. Further analysis suggests that the δ isoform of paxillin, rather than the canonical β isoform, plays the key role. Additionally, our data indicate that lysine 68 of paxillin δ undergoes K6-linked ubiquitination and regulates influenza virus replication via modulating endosome-dependent viral entry. These observations contribute to understanding how influenza viruses interact with host factors and may inform therapeutic development.

Title: Contrasting interferon-mediated antiviral responses in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Abstract: Lung cancers develop from lung epithelial cells after a series of genetic and epigenetic changes, and these cells are major sites of influenza virus infection. Thus, we explored how changes found in patient-derived lung cancer cell lines impacted influenza virus replication and identified two lines with opposite responses to influenza A viral infection. We show that the NCI-H820 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is resistant to influenza A virus and VSV infection, while LUAD line NCI-H322 is highly susceptible to infection by both viruses. H322 cells have a homozygous deletion in a region of chromosome 9 encoding IFNαgenes, IFNβ1, IFNω1, and IFNε genes, leading to downregulation of immune response and high infection rates. In contrast, the resistant H820 cell line has three copies of these same interferon genes and shows increased expression of interferon-regulated genes. We found that the resistance of H820 cells to influenza infection is likely linked to impaired viral entry-due to high basal levels of interferon-induced proteins known to inhibit endocytosis (IFITM1/2/3, NCOA7, and CH25H)-and to increased expression of mRNAs that encode other antiviral factors. In contrast, H322 cells show the absence or low levels of interferon-regulated genes involved in the inhibition of viral entry. These results suggest that the opposite phenotypes on viral entry of H322 and H820 cells may be at least in part associated with impaired or enhanced interferon response, respectively. Since most lung cancer patients have genomic characterization of their tumors, individualized differences in interferon responses may have therapeutic and patient management implications. Lung cancers develop from genetic and epigenetic changes that can dramatically influence patients' susceptibility to viral infection and replication. This study evaluates the responses to influenza virus infection of two patient-derived lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the cell lines investigated are of the same cancer type, lung adenocarcinomas, yet one cell line is highly susceptible, while the other cell line is highly resistant to viral infection. This is in part due to contrasting genetic alterations that lead to changes in the interferon response pathways, which differentially impact viral entry. Thus, identifying these risk factors can inform the prognosis of patients infected with influenza virus and guide their personalized treatment plans.

Reason: Focuses on host cell genetic and epigenetic factors affecting viral infection susceptibility, without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: KRT6A Restricts Influenza A Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Nuclear Import and Assembly of Viral Ribonucleoprotein Complex.
Abstract: The transcription and replication of the genome of influenza A virus (IAV) take place in the nucleus of infected cells, which is catalyzed by the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. The nuclear import of the vRNP complex and its component proteins is essential for the efficient replication of IAV and is therefore prone to be targeted by host restriction factors. Herein, we found that host cellular protein keratin 6A (KRT6A) is a negative regulator of IAV replication because siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>KRT6A</i> expression increased the growth titers of IAV, whereas exogenous overexpression of KRT6A reduced viral yields. The nuclear import of incoming vRNP complexes and newly synthesized nucleoprotein (NP) was significantly impaired when KRT6A was overexpressed. Further studies showed that KRT6A interacts with the four vRNP complex proteins-polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic protein (PA), and NP. Notably, the interaction between KRT6A and vRNP complex proteins had no effect on the nuclear import of PB2 or the PB1-PA heterodimer but impaired the interaction between NP and the nuclear import adaptor importin α3, thereby inhibiting the nuclear import of incoming vRNP complexes and newly synthesized NP. Moreover, KRT6A was further shown to suppress the assembly of the vRNP complex and consequently reduce viral polymerase activity. Together, our data uncover a novel role of KRT6A in counteracting the nuclear import and functions of the vRNP complex, thereby restricting the replication of IAV.

Title: Novel Minimal Absent Words Detected in Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza is a communicable disease caused by RNA viruses. Strains A (affecting animals, humans), B (affecting humans), C (affecting rarely humans and pigs), and D (affecting cattle) comprise a variety of substrains each. Influenza A strain, affecting both humans and animals, is considered the most infectious, causing pandemics. There is an emerging need for the accurate classification of the different influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, elucidating their mode of infection, as well as their fast and accurate diagnosis. Notably, in recent years, oligomeric sequences (words) that are present in the pathogen genomes and entirely absent from the host human genome were suggested to provide robust biomarkers for virus classification and rapid detection. To this end, we performed updated phylogenetic analyses of the IAV hemagglutinin genes, focusing on the sub H1N1 and H5N1. More importantly, we applied in silico methods to identify minimum length "words" that exist consistently in the IAV genomes and are entirely absent from the human genome; these sequences identified in our current analysis may represent minimal signatures that can be utilized to distinguish IAV from other influenza viruses, as well as to perform rapid diagnostic tests.
Relevant: False
Reason: In silico identification of genomic sequence signatures for virus classification and detection, without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Improving Influenza Nomenclature Based on Transmission Dynamics.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) evolve rapidly, exhibit zoonotic potential, and frequently adapt to new hosts, often establishing long-term reservoirs. Despite advancements in genetic sequencing and phylogenetic classification, current influenza nomenclature systems remain static, failing to capture evolving epidemiological patterns. This rigidity has led to delays or misinterpretations in public health responses, economic disruptions, and confusion in scientific communication. The existing nomenclature does not adequately reflect real-time transmission dynamics or host adaptations, limiting its usefulness for public health management. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic exemplified these limitations, as it was mischaracterized as "swine flu" despite sustained human-to-human transmission and no direct pig-to-human transmission reported. This review proposes a real-time, transmission-informed nomenclature system that prioritizes host adaptation and sustained transmissibility (R<sub>0</sub> > 1) to align influenza classification with epidemiological realities and risk management. Through case studies of H1N1pdm09, H5N1, and H7N9, alongside a historical overview of influenza naming, we demonstrate the advantages of integrating transmission dynamics into naming conventions. Adopting a real-time, transmission-informed approach will improve pandemic preparedness, strengthen global surveillance, and enhance influenza classification for scientists, policymakers, and public health agencies.
Relevant: False
Reason: A review proposing improved influenza nomenclature based on transmission dynamics, without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 are essential for an optimal T cell response to influenza.
Abstract: Inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR1/2/3/5 (iCCRs) play an important role in the recruitment of immune cells involved in innate immune functions and orchestrating the adaptive immune response. Here we utilise an influenza A virus (IAV) challenge to investigate the combinatorial roles of the iCCRs in the anti-IAV immune response. We did not observe any gross differences in infection-driven pathology in the absence of iCCRs. iCCR deletion resulted in decreased numbers of some antigen-presenting cell types in the lung (B cells, DC1s, monocytes and inflammatory macrophages), though cell numbers in the draining lymph node were not affected. Whilst the total number of T cells was similar in lungs of iCCR-deficient mice, the number of IAV-specific CD4 but not CD8 T cells in the lung was strongly reduced in the absence of iCCRs. Furthermore, fewer CD4, but not CD8, T cells produced IFN-γ. This CD4 T cell phenotype persisted into the memory stage of infection, with fewer IAV-specific and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> CD4 but not CD8 T cells at 29 days post infection. In conclusion, despite having limited impact on antigen-presenting cell migration between the lung and the draining lymph node, iCCR deletion is associated with an altered CD4 T cell response to IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host immune response and chemokine receptor roles in T cell responses to influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Metabolic modeling elucidates phenformin and atpenin A5 as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against RNA viruses.
Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reemphasized the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. We developed a computational workflow using scRNA-Seq data to assess cellular metabolism during viral infection. With this workflow we predicted the capacity of cells to sustain SARS-CoV-2 virion production in patients and found a tissue-wide induction of metabolic pathways that support viral replication. Expanding our analysis to influenza A and dengue viruses, we identified metabolic targets and inhibitors for potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatment. These targets were highly enriched for known interaction partners of all analyzed viruses. Indeed, phenformin, an NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase inhibitor, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus replication. Atpenin A5, blocking succinate dehydrogenase, inhibited SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus with high selectivity indices. In vivo, phenformin showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a Syrian hamster model. Our work establishes host metabolism as druggable for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies, providing invaluable tools for pandemic preparedness.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host metabolism and antiviral drug effects without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Baicalin enhances respiratory mucosal immunity by modulating antiviral protein expression and T-cell homeostasis during H9N2 infection.
Abstract: The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus's suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). These dual protective effects highlight baicalin's potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the effect of baicalin on host immune responses and antiviral protein expression during H9N2 infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza during 2023.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a record 15,014 human influenza-positive samples during 2023. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic, and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or embryonated hens' eggs for potential use in seasonal influenza virus vaccines. During 2023, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria viruses predominated, accounting for 37% and 28% respectively of all viruses received, compared to 12% for influenza A(H3N2). The majority of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically and genetically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the southern hemisphere in 2023. Of 5,531 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, seven A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition against oseltamivir.
Relevant: False
Reason: The report summarizes antigenic, genetic, and antiviral susceptibility properties of influenza viruses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral potential of diosmin against influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza poses a global health threat. With drug-resistant strains emerging, there is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs. This study explores antiviral potential of flavonoids against influenza A virus (IAV) and their mechanism of action. By utilizing in silico docking as a screening approach, diosmin, orientin, and fisetin were identified as flavonoids with the strongest interactions with viral proteins. Out of them, diosmin was found to effectively inhibit IAV replication in vitro, particularly at the attachment and post-entry stages, with significant inhibition observed at 0-h post-infection (hpi) and 2 hpi, while also demonstrated prophylactic activity, peaking at - 2 hpi. Following that, diosmin significantly increases the expression of antiviral genes, which may relate to the discovery of its prophylactic activity. Proteomics analysis showed that diosmin treatment during the post-entry stage of IAV replication reduced viral protein levels, confirming its antiviral activity at this point. Additionally, diosmin also modulated host proteins related to innate immunity, inducing type I interferon and anti-inflammatory responses during the infection. These findings provide preliminary evidence of diosmin's antiviral and prophylactic activity against IAV, paving the way for further research on its mechanism of action.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral activity of diosmin and host immune modulation without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Taurultam shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus are highly contagious respiratory viruses that continuously pose major threats to human and public health. The high frequency of viral mutations led to the emergence of resistant isolates and caused virus epidemics repeatedly, emphasizing the urgent need to develop new antivirals. Taurultam is a metabolite of taurolidine. Moreover, taurolidine has been shown to have potent antiviral activities against multiple viruses and to have antiviral effects through its metabolites. In this study, we sought to determine the antiviral activities of taurultam against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in Vero-E6, Huh7, 293T-ACE2, and MDCK cell lines and mouse infection models. The results showed that taurultam exhibited potent antiviral activity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) virus and influenza B virus, in vitro. Moreover, in influenza A (H1N1) virus, influenza B virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection models, taurultam significantly reduced viral loads, increased survival, improved mouse body weight and lung injury. Surprisingly, taurultam treatment not only inhibited the influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, but also benefited for therapy of mixed infection of these two viruses in vitro, demonstrating the great antiviral potential of taurultam for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections. Together, our findings identify taurultam as a new candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections, especially virus-induced lung pathology. Not applicable.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of taurultam against viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: USP1 inhibits influenza A and B virus replication in MDCK cells by mediating RIG-I deubiquitination.
Abstract: The post-translational modification and stability regulation of RIG-I play critical roles in promoting IFN-I production and maintaining immune homeostasis. In this study, we found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 1 (USP1) promotes RIG-I protein stability through deubiquitination, which in turn enhances antiviral immunity through the production of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits the replication of influenza virus in MDCK cells. In contrast, USP1 knockdown inhibited the deubiquitination of RIG-I, decreased the RIG-I protein level, and significantly increased the influenza virus titer. Meanwhile, inhibition of USP1 expression did not have a significant effect on the proliferation of MDCK cells, suggesting that USP1 could be used as a target gene to establish a vaccine-producing MDCK cell line. The above results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the function of USP1 and the antiviral response mechanism, and provide a theoretical and methodological basis for the screening of target genes for the artificial establishment of high-yield MDCK cell lines for vaccine production.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of USP1 in host antiviral immunity without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation mechanism using violet-blue light (405 nm).
Abstract: The study evaluated the effects of violet-blue light (VBL) on cell viability and replication, carbonylation of three structural proteins (S, E, and N) and one non-structural protein (NSP13), and direct damage to the RNA of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was exposed to increasing doses of VBL along with influenza A and B viruses to compare their susceptibility. At the highest dose (21.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), SARS-CoV-2 was significantly more susceptible to VBL than the influenza viruses, with a reduction in viral titer of 2.33 log<sub>10</sub>. Viral RNA did not show significant changes after exposure to VBL, as demonstrated by next-generation sequencing and real-time PCR quantification, suggesting that the inactivation process does not involve direct nucleic acid damage. To exclude the role of the culture suspension in the inactivation process, virus viability experiments were performed using different dilutions of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The results indicated that the suspension medium played a secondary role in virus inactivation, as viability did not increase with increasing DMEM dilution. Subsequent tests with three different antioxidants (NAC, AsA, and SOD) at different concentrations prevented viral inactivation, from 99.99% to 85.43% (with SOD 0.003 mM). Carbonylation of S and E proteins was more pronounced when viruses were suspended in DMEM rather than PBS, although the tests demonstrated that the intrinsic properties of the viral membrane were a crucial element to consider in relation to its susceptibility to VBL.IMPORTANCELight-based disinfection methods are often used in combination with other cleaning methods due to their non-invasive nature, versatility, and environmental benefits. VBL is an effective approach as it induces the production of reactive oxygen species that reduce microbial viability. In this study, lipid peroxidation was identified as an important factor affecting the structural integrity and function of the viral envelope, reducing its ability to interact with host cells and consequently its ability to be infectious. The lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2, composed mainly of glycerophospholipids and lacking cholesterol and sphingolipids, appears to be the critical factor in its susceptibility, distinguishing it from influenza viruses, which have a lipid profile richer in components that protect against oxidative stress.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates viral inactivation mechanisms by violet-blue light focusing on viral structural and lipid components, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus interferes with respiratory syncytial virus in mice and reconstituted human airway epithelium.
Abstract: Epidemiological studies suggest that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) might interfere with each other. Viral interference mainly relies on interferon production elicited by a first virus that reduces the replication of a second virus. In this paper, we first investigated the interactions between RSV-A2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in BALB/c mice infected with each single virus or both viruses simultaneously or sequentially before, at the peak of interferon elicited by each virus, or after that peak. IAV reduced by almost 3.0 logs the replication of RSV administered at the peak of interferon induced by influenza, but the opposite was not true. However, IAV-infected mice challenged with RSV or the vehicle lost more weight and had a lower survival rate compared to single infections. Interferon expression, cytokine levels, and pulmonary inflammation were almost similar between groups. Disease worsening was attributed to an aggravation of IAV-induced pulmonary congestion following intranasal instillation of fluid (with or without RSV). In human airway epithelia, IAV also interfered with RSV replication. Viral interference was dependent on the timing and sequence of infections but not on differential interferon susceptibilities. Overall, our results help to understand the mechanisms of the interaction between two major respiratory viruses.IMPORTANCERespiratory syncytial and influenza viruses may interfere with each other based on epidemiological studies. It is suggested that a first virus may induce the production of interferon and interfere with the replication of a second unrelated virus. Our data showed that the influenza A virus interferes with respiratory syncytial virus replication in mouse lungs, but the opposite was not observed. In reconstituted human airway epithelia, viral interference was dependent on the timing and sequence of infections but not on differential interferon susceptibilities. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between respiratory viruses may help the development of prophylactic or therapeutic modalities.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines viral interference between influenza A and RSV focusing on host immune responses, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Trypstatin as a Novel TMPRSS2 Inhibitor with Broad-Spectrum Efficacy against Corona and Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, exploit host proteases like TMPRSS2 for entry, making TMPRSS2 a prime antiviral target. Here, the identification and characterization of Trypstatin, a 61-amino acid Kunitz-type protease inhibitor derived from human hemofiltrate are reported. Trypstatin inhibits TMPRSS2 and related proteases with high potency, exhibiting half-maximal inhibitory concentration values in the nanomolar range, comparable to the small molecule inhibitor camostat mesylate. In vitro assays demonstrate that Trypstatin effectively blocks spike-driven entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-NL63, as well as hemagglutinin-mediated entry of influenza A and B viruses. In primary human airway epithelial cultures, Trypstatin significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication and retained activity in the presence of airway mucus. In vivo, intranasal administration of Trypstatin to SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters reduces viral titers and alleviates clinical symptoms. These findings highlight Trypstatin's potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against TMPRSS2-dependent respiratory viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes Trypstatin as a host protease inhibitor with antiviral activity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Screening of neurotransmitter receptor modulators reveals novel inhibitors of influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza presents a significant public health threat, as severe cases can lead to excessive inflammation and complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Current antiviral agents targeting viral proteins may lead to the development of resistance, highlighting the need for new agents targeting host factors. Neurotransmitter receptors are vital for cellular signaling and cell cycle modulation, making them promising antiviral therapeutic targets. Recent research has demonstrated that screening libraries of compounds aimed at these receptors can help identify inhibitors that prevent the replication of various viruses, including filoviruses and SARS-CoV-2. We screened a neurotransmitter receptor modulator library in influenza-infected U937 cells and found that many adrenergic, histamine, dopamine, and serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists exhibit antiviral activity. We identified 20 candidate compounds with IC50 values below 20 μM, suggesting a critical role for these receptors in influenza replication. Three representative compounds (isoxsuprine, ciproxifan, and rotigotine) inhibited H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner in multiple cell lines, and were effective against H1N1, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B strains. Mechanistic studies indicated that these compounds affect virus internalization during the early infection stages. In a mouse model of lethal influenza, isoxsuprine significantly decreased lung viral titers, mitigated pulmonary inflammation, and enhanced survival rates. These findings highlight neurotransmitter receptors as potential targets for developing novel anti-influenza agents, providing a foundation for further optimization of the identified compounds as potential therapeutic agents.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study screens neurotransmitter receptor modulators for antiviral activity targeting host factors, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Anti-Influenza Activity of 6BIGOE: Improved Pharmacological Profile After Encapsulation in PLGA Nanoparticles.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections continue to threaten public health. Current strategies, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs, are limited due to their time-consuming development and drug-resistant strains. Therefore, new effective treatments are needed. Here, virus-supportive cellular factors are promising drug targets, and the encapsulation of candidate substances in poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) is intended to improve their bioavailability. This study investigates the potential of the indirubin derivative 6-bromoindirubin-3'-glycerol-oxime ether (6BIGOE), a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)β inhibitor, for its potential to regulate IAV replication in vitro. The effects of 6BIGOE-loaded PLGA NPs on cell metabolism were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays in A549 and Calu-3 cells. Viral replication and spread were monitored in various IAV-infected cell lines in the absence and presence of free and 6BIGOE-loaded PLGA NPs via plaque assays and Western blot analysis. The encapsulation of 6BIGOE in PLGA NPs resulted in reduced negative side effects on cell viability while maintaining antiviral efficacy. Both encapsulated and free 6BIGOE exhibited antiviral activity, potentially through GSK-3β inhibition and the disruption of key signaling pathways required for viral replication. The data indicate 6BIGOE, particularly after encapsulation in NPs, as a potential candidate for further investigation and development as an antiviral agent to treat IAV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates antiviral activity of 6BIGOE and its encapsulation effects on host cells and viral replication, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Hypercapnia Increases Influenza A Virus Infection of Bronchial Epithelial Cells by Augmenting Cellular Cholesterol via mTOR and Akt.
Abstract: Hypercapnia, the elevation of CO<sub>2</sub> in blood and tissue, is a risk factor for mortality in patients with severe lung disease and pulmonary infections. We previously showed that hypercapnia increases viral replication and mortality in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> also augmented cholesterol content and pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 entry in bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, cellular cholesterol facilitates IAV uptake, replication, assembly, and egress from cells. Here, we report that hypercapnia increases viral protein expression in airway epithelium of mice infected with IAV. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> also enhanced IAV adhesion and internalization, viral protein expression, and viral replication in bronchial epithelial cells. Hypercapnia increased the expression and activation of the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), resulting in elevated expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes, decreased expression of a cholesterol efflux transporter, and augmented cellular cholesterol. Moreover, reducing cellular cholesterol with an SREBP2 inhibitor or statins blocked hypercapnia-induced increases in viral adhesion and internalization, viral protein expression, and IAV replication. Inhibitors of mTOR and Akt also blocked the effect of hypercapnia on viral growth. Our findings suggest that targeting cholesterol synthesis and/or mTOR/Akt signaling may hold promise for reducing susceptibility to influenza infection in patients with advanced lung disease and hypercapnia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines how hypercapnia affects host cell cholesterol and influenza virus infection, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Nucleophosmin 1 inhibits the replication of influenza A virus by competitively binding viral RNA with viral proteins.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses that continually challenge animal and human health. In IAV-infected cells, host RNA-binding proteins play key roles in the life cycle of IAV by directly binding to viral RNA. Here, we examined the role of the host RNA-binding protein nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) in IAV replication. We found that, as a nucleolar phosphoprotein, NPM1 directly binds to viral RNA (vRNA) and inhibits the replication of various subtypes of IAV. NPM1 binding to vRNA competitively reduces the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the viral polymerase activity, thereby reducing the generation of progeny viral RNA and virions. The RNA-binding activity of NPM1, with the key residues T199, T219, T234, and T237, is essential for its anti-influenza function. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NPM1 acts as an RNA-binding protein and interacts with IAV vRNA to suppress viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host protein NPM1 interaction with viral RNA and its effect on viral replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses: knowns, unknowns, and challenges.
Abstract: Since 2020, the clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused unprecedented outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry globally, resulting in significant ecological damage and economic losses due to the disease and enforced stamp-out control. In addition to the avian hosts, the H5N1 viruses have expanded their host range to infect many mammalian species, potentially increasing the zoonotic risk. Here, we review the current knowns and unknowns of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 viruses, and we highlight common challenges in prevention. By integrating our knowledge of viral evolution and ecology, we aim to identify discrepancies and knowledge gaps for a more comprehensive understanding of the virus. Ultimately, this review will serve as a theoretical foundation for researchers involved in related avian influenza virus studies, aiding in improved control and prevention of H5N1 viruses.

Title: Comparative Analysis of the Evolutionary Dynamics of Seasonal Influenza Viruses in Madagascar Before and Since the Pandemic Period of COVID-19.
Abstract: Madagascar has maintained an influenza surveillance program for decades. Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, the country implemented strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that disrupted influenza circulation. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in Madagascar over a 5-year period, spanning both the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 pandemic periods: 2019-2023. We showed that global genetic evolution profiles for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses occurred from the pre-pandemic to the pandemic period of COVID-19 in Madagascar. In addition, we observed distinct patterns of viral re-emergence following the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures. This study underscores the importance of sustaining continuous surveillance of influenza virus circulation to monitor the emergence of new variants and identify clade-specific isolates. In addition, these results suggest that targeted NPIs could complement vaccination strategies in reducing influenza transmission and should be integrated into a comprehensive approach for effective influenza control.

Title: A genetically engineered therapeutic lectin inhibits human influenza A virus infection and sustains robust virus-specific CD8 T cell expansion.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza continues to be a global health problem. Current existing vaccines and antivirals against influenza have limited effectiveness, and typically do not stay ahead of the viral evolutionary curve. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents that are effective therapeutically and prophylactically are much needed. We have created a promising new broad-spectrum anti-influenza agent using molecular engineering of a lectin from bananas, H84T, which is well-tolerated and protective in small animal models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and influenza-specific immune responses are undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited influenza A virus (IAV) replication in primary human dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from blood and tonsil, preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Excitingly, H84T-treated DCs subsequently initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell expansion. Our data support H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it not only effectively inhibits IAV infection, but also preserves induction of robust pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.
Relevant: False

Title: Antiviral Effect of Erdosteine in Cells Infected with Human Respiratory Viruses.
Abstract: Respiratory viral infections trigger immune and inflammatory responses that can be associated with excessive oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) depletion, and a cytokine storm that drives virus-induced cell/tissue damage and severe disease. Erdosteine is a thiol-based drug with proven mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, but less is known about its antiviral effects. We performed in vitro studies to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of erdosteine in A549-hACE2 human lung epithelial cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells infected with influenza A virus (H1N1). The cells were treated with different concentrations of erdosteine or its active metabolite 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MET-1) before and after viral infection. The viral replication/load in the cell culture supernatants was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay and digital droplet PCR. The gene expression of innate immune response signaling pathways and oxidative stress was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR custom-array. The results showed that erdosteine and its active metabolite, at concentrations consistent with an approved therapeutic human dosage, were not directly cytotoxic and had significant antiviral effects in cells pre-infected with SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and H1N1. The transcriptome analysis showed that erdosteine activated innate immune responses by stimulating overexpression of type I interferon and inflammasome pathways and modulated oxidative stress by inducing the modulation of oxidative stress and GSH pathways. These findings suggest that erdosteine may be a useful treatment for respiratory viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: Investigates antiviral effects of erdosteine on viral replication and host responses, but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Refinement of imidazo[2,1-a]pyrimidines in pursuit of potential drug candidates against group 2 influenza A viruses.
Abstract: We discovered a series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines as potent, group 2 selective inhibitors of influenza A viruses (IAVs) that target the hemagglutinin-mediated viral entry process. Preliminary hit-to-lead optimization efforts afforded promising IAV inhibitors with improved activity against infectious H7N7 and H3N2 viruses. We now report a more comprehensive cycle of structure-activity relationship studies and optimization of metabolic stability, and overall druglike properties of this series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines, which allowed in the identification of two lead compounds that show promise as preclinical candidates. Compounds 10 and 12 inhibited pseudotyped H7N1 with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.09 and 0.47 μM, respectively. They were among the most potent compounds in the viral replication assay when tested against infectious H3N2 IAV, and they also demonstrated remarkable activity against avian influenza viruses; these data designated these imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines as potent broad-spectrum group 2 IAV inhibitors. Compounds 10 and 12 exhibit dissimilar but desirable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) profiles, and therefore they offer different options for specific and effective patient treatment.

Most of the cranes, particularly those collected in November, were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses; virus shedding was higher from the trachea than from the cloaca. The isolation rate from the cranes' roost water was not markedly higher than that of previous seasons, suggesting that the viruses might be more effectively transmitted among cranes via the respiratory route than through feces. Most wild bird-derived H5N1 isolates were phylogenetically distinct from viruses isolated on nearby chicken farms, indicating limited relationship between the wild bird and chicken isolates. Serologic analyses suggested that herd immunity had little effect on outbreak subsidence. This study deepens our understanding of the circumstances surrounding the unexpected HPAI outbreaks among these endangered cranes.

Title: Multiple antiviral mechanisms of Ephedrae Herba and Cinnamomi Cortex against influenza: inhibition of entry and replication.
Abstract: Maoto, a traditional herbal medicine widely prescribed in Japan, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza virus infection, but the mechanisms of its antiviral action remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that maoto binds to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spike proteins, thereby inhibiting their entry into host cells. In this report, a similar experiment was done to determine if maoto and its components have an anti-infective effect on the influenza virus. Our results indicate that maoto binds to the hemagglutinin (HA) spike protein, inhibiting virus entry into host cells in a manner analogous to its antiviral effect on RSV. This hemagglutinin-binding effect was observed across influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B viruses, highlighting the broad-spectrum inhibitory potential of maoto against diverse viral strains. Furthermore, maoto, internalized by cells along with the influenza virus, binds to a cap-dependent endonuclease (polymerase acidic [PA] protein) that is crucial for viral replication and inhibits its nuclease activity. Among maoto's constituent crude drugs, Ephedrae Herba (EH) and Cinnamomi Cortex (CC) were found to bind to both hemagglutinin and PA, indicating that they are responsible for the anti-infective effect of maoto. Maoto is distinctive in its multiple points of antiviral action, exhibiting a broad spectrum of antiviral properties, which makes it a versatile therapeutic agent against various viral mutations.IMPORTANCEThe influenza virus is a formidable pathogen responsible for global pandemics that claim over 300,000 lives annually. Employing an ingenious evolutionary strategy, this virus undergoes constant mutation, deftly evading the action of therapeutic agents and sustaining its relentless impact. Maoto, a traditional herbal medicine, has long been known for its efficacy against viral infections and is frequently prescribed in Japan for the treatment of influenza; however, the precise mechanisms of its action remain unclear. Our study was done to elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of maoto against the influenza virus, presenting data that supports its unique potential as a therapeutic agent capable of flexibly adapting to mutations of the influenza virus. These findings pave the way for the development of new drugs and the expansion of therapeutic options.
Relevant: False
Reason: Investigates antiviral mechanisms of herbal medicine components without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Custom barcoded primers for influenza A nanopore sequencing: enhanced performance with reduced preparation time.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza is endemic and widespread in wild birds and is causing major outbreaks in poultry worldwide and in U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases, highlighting the need for reliable and rapid sequencing to track mutations that may facilitate viral replication in different hosts. SNP analysis is a useful molecular epidemiology tool to track outbreaks, but it requires accurate whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with sufficient read depth across all eight segments. In outbreak situations, where timely data is critical for controlling the spread of the virus, reducing sequencing preparation time while maintaining high-quality standards is particularly important. In this study, we optimized a custom barcoded primer strategy for influenza A whole-genome sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform, combining the high performance of the Native Barcoding Kit with the prompt preparation time of the Rapid Barcoding Kit. Custom barcoded primers were designed to perform barcode attachment during RT-PCR amplification, eliminating the need for separate barcoding and clean-up steps, thus reducing library preparation time. We compared the performance of the custom barcoded primer method with the Native and Rapid barcoding kits in terms of read quality, read depth, and sequencing output. The results show that the custom barcoded primers provided performance comparable to the Native Barcoding Kit while reducing library preparation time by 2.3X compared to the Native kit and being only 15 minutes longer than the Rapid kit with better depth of sequencing. Additionally, the custom barcoded primer method was evaluated on a variety of clinical sample types. This approach offers a promising solution for influenza A sequencing, providing both high throughput and time efficiency, which significantly improves the time-to-result turnaround, making sequencing more accessible for real-time surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on methodological improvements in influenza A virus whole-genome sequencing using nanopore technology and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: EIDD-2801 resists to infection and co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.
Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exerted a catastrophic impact on public health. Meanwhile, the seasonal influenza outbreak overlaps with the current pandemic wave. There is still an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of co-infection of multiple respiratory viruses. This study aimed to investigate antiviral effects of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable ribonucleoside analog, and its potent therapeutic effects in co-infection of multiple respiratory viruses. BALB/c mice and hamsters were infected with IFV or SARS-CoV-2, then were dosed orally with EIDD-2801 to measure the antiviral effects of EIDD-2801. Viral replication and mRNA transcription were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and protein expression by Western Blot. Influenza viral titer was assessed using EID<sub>50</sub> assay. EIDD-2801 was found to be significantly effective against influenza A virus and influenza B virus. The antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and further co-infection with influenza virus was also distinct. EIDD-2801 had potent antiviral effects against multiple respiratory viruses both in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrated that the small-molecule compound EIDD-2801, an orally available broad-spectrum antiviral agent, significantly inhibited the infection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 and effectively protected animals from lethal influenza virus co-infection.

Title: Single influenza A viruses induce nanoscale cellular reprogramming at the virus-cell interface.
Abstract: During infection, individual virions trigger specific cellular signaling at the virus-cell interface, a nanoscale region of the plasma membrane in direct contact with the virus. However, virus-induced receptor recruitment and cellular activation are transient processes that occur within minutes at the nanoscale. Hence, the temporal and spatial kinetics of such early events often remain poorly understood due to technical limitations. To address this challenge, we develop a protocol to covalently immobilize labelled influenza A viruses on glass surfaces before exposing them to live epithelial cells. Our method extends the observation time for virus-plasma membrane association while minimizing viral modifications, facilitating live imaging of virus-cell interactions. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, we investigate virus-receptor interaction showing that viral receptors exhibit reduced mobility at the virus-binding site, which leads to a specific local receptor accumulation and turnover. We further follow the dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the single-virus level and demonstrate the recruitment of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), previously thought to be uninvolved in influenza A virus infection. Finally, we examine the nanoscale organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the virus-binding site, showing a local and dynamic response of the cellular actin cortex to the infecting virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on nanoscale imaging of virus-cell interactions and cellular responses during influenza A virus infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus RNA localisation and the interceding trafficking pathways of the host cell.
Abstract: Viruses have evolved to efficiently navigate host cells to deliver, express, and replicate their genetic material. Understanding the mechanisms underlying viral RNA localisation is paramount to designing new antivirals. In this review, we discuss Influenza A Virus (IAV) as a model system to highlight some of the ways in which RNA viruses can hijack the endomembrane systems, as well as nuclear transporters, to achieve the correct localisation of their transcripts. IAV exemplifies a nuclear-replicating RNA virus with a complex and highly regulated RNA localisation and trafficking system within host cells. The virus subverts various vesicular transport systems and nuclear transporters, altering normal cellular functions. IAV RNA trafficking begins during entry; after clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the viral genome (vRNPs) is released into the cytosol after fusion with the endosomal membrane, and it is subsequently imported into the nucleus via the importin system. There, vRNPs engage with most major subnuclear structures and exploit host chromatin, the transcription machinery and splicing apparatus to achieve efficient viral mRNA synthesis and export. Subsequently, newly synthesised vRNPs are rapidly exported from the nucleus and contact the host's recycling endosome network for transport to the plasma membrane. We discuss the critical viral remodelling of the entire endomembrane system, particularly the Rab11 recycling endosome and the endoplasmic reticulum. Lastly, replicated genomes come together into bundles to be inserted in budding virions, and we discuss the current models being proposed and the evidence behind them. Despite advances in understanding these processes, several knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the specific export of unspliced IAV transcripts, the remodelling of the endomembrane system, and segment bundling.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review focusing on viral RNA localization and trafficking mechanisms without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: B cells modulate lung antiviral inflammatory responses via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
Abstract: The rapid onset of innate immune defenses is critical for early control of viral replication in an infected host and yet it can also lead to irreversible tissue damage, especially in the respiratory tract. Sensitive regulators must exist that modulate inflammation, while controlling the infection. In the present study, we identified acetylcholine (ACh)-producing B cells as such early regulators. B cells are the most prevalent ACh-producing leukocyte population in the respiratory tract demonstrated with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mice, both before and after infection with influenza A virus. Mice lacking ChAT in B cells, disabling their ability to generate ACh (ChatBKO), but not those lacking ChAT in T cells, significantly, selectively and directly suppressed α7-nicotinic-ACh receptor-expressing interstitial, but not alveolar, macrophage activation and their ability to secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF), while better controlling virus replication at 1 d postinfection. Conversely, TNF blockade via monoclonal antibody treatment increased viral loads at that time. By day 10 of infection, ChatBKO mice showed increased local and systemic inflammation and reduced signs of lung epithelial repair despite similar viral loads and viral clearance. Thus, B cells are key participants of an immediate early regulatory cascade that controls lung tissue damage after viral infection, shifting the balance toward reduced inflammation at the cost of enhanced early viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host immune modulation by B cells and acetylcholine during viral infection, without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: High Glucose Reduces Influenza and Parainfluenza Virus Productivity by Altering Glycolytic Pattern in A549 Cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is responsible for annual epidemics and occasional pandemics leading to significant mortality and morbidity in human populations. Parainfluenza viruses also contribute to lung infections and chronic lung disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of high glucose on the productivity of influenza A and Sendai (murine parainfluenza type 1) viruses in A549 immortalized cells. A glycolytic pattern of infection was determined by monitoring the release of lactate and phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in infected and uninfected cells. qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of viral and cellular cytokine mRNA levels in cultured cells. The data show that the productivity of both influenza and Sendai viruses was reduced in A549 cells cultured in high-glucose conditions. This was accompanied by increased lactate production and altered PFK activity profile. Endogenous or virus infection-induced interferon β (IFN-β) mRNA expression was significantly decreased in high glucose compared to normal glucose status during early times of infection. Unlike in Sendai virus-infected cells, H1N1 virus reversed the significant increase in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) mRNA expression due to increased glucose concentration during early infection times. In conclusion, high glucose may have a negative effect on influenza and parainfluenza productivity in vitro. This effect may be considered when evaluating personalized therapeutic/diagnostic markers in infection-accompanied hyperglycemic status.
Relevant: False
Reason: Examines the effect of high glucose on viral productivity and host cell metabolism without explicit genotype-phenotype viral mutation analysis.

Title: Pirfenidone Mitigates Transforming Growth Factor-β-induced Inflammation after Viral Infection.
Abstract: Infection by influenza A virus (IAV) and other viruses causes disease exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Immune responses are blunted in COPD, a deficit compounded by current standard-of-care glucocorticosteroids (GCS) to further predispose patients to life-threatening infections. The immunosuppressive effects of elevated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in COPD may amplify lung inflammation during infections while advancing fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated potential repurposing of pirfenidone, currently used as an antifibrotic for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, as a nonsteroidal treatment for viral exacerbations of COPD. Murine models of lung-specific TGF-β overexpression or chronic cigarette smoke exposure with IAV infection were used. Pirfenidone was administered daily by oral gavage commencing pre- or postinfection, and inhaled pirfenidone and GCS treatment preinfection were also compared. Tissue and BAL were assessed for viral replication, inflammation, and immune responses. Overexpression of TGF-β enhanced the severity of IAV infection, contributing to unrestrained airway inflammation. Mechanistically, TGF-β reduced innate immune responses to IAV by blunting IFN-regulated gene expression and suppressing production of antiviral proteins. Prophylactic pirfenidone administration opposed these actions of TGF-β, curbing IAV infection and airway inflammation associated with TGF-β overexpression and cigarette smoke-induced COPD. Notably, inhaled pirfenidone caused greater inhibition of viral loads and inflammation than inhaled GCS. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that repurposing pirfenidone and employing a preventative strategy may yield substantial benefit over antiinflammatory GCS in COPD. Pirfenidone can mitigate damaging viral exacerbations without attendant immunosuppressive actions and merits further investigation, particularly as an inhaled formulation.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host immune response modulation by pirfenidone during viral infection, without direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Nuclear AGO2 supports influenza A virus replication through type-I interferon regulation.
Abstract: The role of Argonaute (AGO) proteins and the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery in mammalian antiviral response has been debated. Therefore, we set out to investigate how mammalian RNAi impacts influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We reveal that IAV infection triggers nuclear accumulation of AGO2, which is directly facilitated by p53 activation. Mechanistically, we show that IAV induces nuclear AGO2 targeting of TRIM71and type-I interferon-pathway genes for silencing. Accordingly, Tp53-/- mice do not accumulate nuclear AGO2 and demonstrate decreased susceptibility to IAV infection. Hence, the RNAi machinery is highjacked by the virus to evade the immune system and support viral replication. Furthermore, the FDA-approved drug, arsenic trioxide, prevents p53 nuclear translocation, increases interferon response and decreases viral replication in vitro and in a mouse model in vivo. Our data indicate that targeting the AGO2:p53-mediated silencing of innate immunity may offer a promising strategy to mitigate viral infections.

Title: Synergistic Antiviral Activity of European Black Elderberry Fruit Extract and Quinine Against SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virusa.
Abstract: The persistent threat of emerging respiratory RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus (IAV) necessitates the continuous development of effective, safe, broadly acting, and generally accessible antiviral agents. Current treatments often face limitations such as early administration requirements, resistance development, and limited global access. Natural products, like European black elderberry (<i>Sambucus nigra</i> L.; <i>S. nigra</i>) fruit extract and quinine, have been used historically against viral infections. In this study, we investigated the antiviral efficacy of a standardized black elderberry fruit extract containing 3.2% anthocyanins (EC 3.2) and, as a second natural antiviral product, quinine, against IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney II (MDCKII) cells were infected with IAV PR-8, while human Calu-3 lung epithelial cells were infected with Wuhan-type SARS-CoV-2. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of EC 3.2 and quinine either as mono- or combinational therapy. Viral replication was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR, and cell viability was evaluated using WST-1 assays. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that both EC 3.2 and quinine individually inhibited IAV replication in a dose-dependent manner, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of approximately 1:400 for EC 3.2 and 250 nM for quinine. Most importantly, the combinational treatment exhibited a strong synergistic antiviral effect, as confirmed by the Bliss independence model (synergy scores of 14.7 for IAV, and 27.8 for SARS-CoV-2), without affecting cell viability. These findings suggest that the combined use of black elderberry extract and quinine might serve as an effective antiviral strategy against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly since the synergistic effect allows for lower doses of each product while retaining therapeutic efficacy. In summary, this combinational in vitro approach, when expanded to other respiratory RNA viruses and confirmed in clinical studies, has the potential to open a promising avenue for pandemic preparedness.

Title: Cell binding, uptake, and infection of influenza A virus using recombinant antibody-based receptors.
Abstract: Human and avian influenza A viruses bind to sialic acid (Sia) receptors on cells as their primary receptors, and this results in endocytic uptake of the virus. While the role of Sia on glycoproteins and/or glycolipids for virus entry is crucial, the roles of the carrier proteins are still not well understood. Furthermore, it is still unclear how receptor binding leads to infection, including whether the receptor plays a structural or other roles beyond being a simple tether. To enable the investigation of the receptor binding and cell entry processes in a more controlled manner, we have designed a protein receptor for pandemic H1 influenza A viruses. The engineered receptor possesses the binding domains of an anti-HA antibody prepared as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused with the stalk, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic sequences of the feline transferrin receptor type-1 (fTfR). When expressed in cells that lack efficient display of Sia due to a knockout of the <i>Slc35A1</i> gene, which encodes for the solute carrier family 35 transporter (SLC35A1), the anti-H1 receptor was displayed on the cell surface, bound virus, or hemagglutinin proteins, and the virus was efficiently endocytosed into the cells. Infection occurred at similar levels to those seen after reintroducing Sia expression, and lower affinity receptor mutants displayed enhanced infections. Treatment with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitors significantly reduced viral entry, indicating that virus rescue by the antibody-based receptor follows a similar internalization route as Sia-expressing cells.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses primarily circulate among avian reservoir hosts but can also jump species, causing outbreaks in mammals, including humans. A key interaction of the viruses is with host cell sialic acids, which vary in chemical form, in their linkages within the oligosaccharide, and in their display on various surface glycoproteins or glycolipids with differing properties. Here, we report a new method for examining the processes of receptor binding and uptake into cells during influenza A virus infection, by use of an engineered HA-binding membrane glycoprotein, where antibody variable domains are used to bind the virus, and the transferrin receptor uptake structures mediate efficient entry. This will allow us to test and manipulate the processes of cell binding, entry, and infection.

Title: Meta-analysis of genomic characteristics for antiviral influenza defective interfering particle prioritization.
Abstract: Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are viral deletion mutants that hamper virus replication and are, thus, potent novel antiviral agents. To evaluate possible antiviral treatments, we first need to get a deeper understanding of DIP characteristics. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of 20 already published sequencing datasets of influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) from <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We analyzed each dataset for characteristics, such as deletion-containing viral genome (DelVG) length distributions, direct repeats, and nucleotide enrichment at the deletion site. Our analysis suggests differences in the length of the 3'- and 5'-end retained in IAV and IBV viral sequences upon deletion. Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> DelVGs tend to be shorter than those <i>in vivo</i>, which is a novel finding with potential implications for future DIP treatment design. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the presence of DelVGs with longer than expected sequences, possibly related to an alternative mechanism of DelVG formation. Finally, a joint ranking of DelVGs originating from 7 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 datasets revealed 11 highly abundant, yet unnoticed, candidates. Together, our study highlights the importance of meta-analyses to uncover yet unknown DelVG characteristics and to pre-select candidates for antiviral treatment design.

Title: Miquelianin inhibits IAV infection via the MAPK signaling pathway both <i>in vitro and in vivo</i>.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease primarily transmitted through airborne droplets. The prevalence and spread of influenza viruses have significant impacts on global economic development and public health. Current prevention and control strategies for influenza virus infections mainly rely on vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, vaccine efficacy is limited by the antigenic drift and mutation characteristics of influenza viruses, while antiviral drug resistance is increasingly prevalent. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel antiviral agents. Flavonoids, widely distributed in plants, possess various potent biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer activities, which contribute to the management and prevention of numerous diseases. This study aims to investigate the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anti-influenza A virus activity of quercetin, taxifolin, and miquelianin, as well as their underlying. <i>In vitro</i> infection model (MDCK cells) and mouse lethal infection model of Infuenza A virus were used to evaluate the antiviral activity of quercetin, taxifolin and miquelianin. Subsequently, we applied network pharmacology to elucidate the mechanism of action and validate the findings for miquelianin. Miquelianin effectively inhibits the replication of H1N1-UI182 both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and provides protection against lethal H1N1-UI182 infection in mice. Compared to virus-infected controls, miquelianin reduces lung injury. Furthermore, by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway, miquelianin prevents the overproduction of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1β, induced by viral infection, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. Miquelianin is a monomer extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, exhibiting inhibitory effects on H1N1-UI182 replication and lung injury mitigation.

Title: The ELF3-TRIM22-MAVS signaling axis regulates type I interferon and antiviral responses.
Abstract: Activation of the innate immune response is essential for host cells to restrict the dissemination of invading viruses and other pathogens. Proteins belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family are key effectors in antiviral innate immunity. Among these, TRIM22, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been recognized as a significant regulator in the pathogenesis of various diseases. In the present study, we identified TRIM22 as a critical modulator of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) activation. Loss of TRIM22 function led to reduced production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection such as influenza A virus (IAV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), thereby facilitating viral replication. Mechanistically, TRIM22 was found to enhance retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated signaling through the catalysis of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS, which, in turn, activated the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway, driving IFN-β production. Additionally, TRIM22 was shown to inhibit the assembly of the MAVS-NLRX1 inhibitory complex, further amplifying innate immune responses. Our findings also demonstrated that RNA virus infection upregulated TRIM22 expression via the nuclear translocation of ELF3, a transcription factor that activates TRIM22 gene expression. This regulatory loop underscores the role of TRIM22 in modulating the type I IFN pathway, providing critical insights into the host's antiviral defense mechanisms. Our research highlights the potential of targeting the ELF3-TRIM22-MAVS axis as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing antiviral immunity and preventing RNA virus infections.IMPORTANCEInterferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses are crucial for the host's defense against foreign pathogens and are regulated by various signaling pathways. The tripartite motif (TRIM) family, recognized for its multifaceted roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense, plays a significant part in this process. In our study, we explored the important role of TRIM22, a protein that helped regulate the host's immune response to viral infections. We found that TRIM22 enhances the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which was essential for producing type I interferons. Interestingly, we discovered that the expression of TRIM22 increases after an RNA virus infection, due to a transcription factor ELF3, which moved into the nucleus of cells to activate TRIM22 transcription. This created a feedback loop that strengthens the role of TRIM22 in modulating the type I IFN pathway. By uncovering these mechanisms, we aimed to enhance our understanding of how the immune system works and provide insights that could lead to innovative antiviral therapies.

Title: Tracking Seasonal Influenza Trends in South Tyrol During 2022/2023 Using Genomic Surveillance Data.
Abstract: Influenza seasons are characterized by a complex interplay of co-circulating strains with high spatial and temporal heterogeneities. Surveillance is crucial for monitoring the spread and evolution of the virus and design effective public health response strategies. We combined epidemiological, virological, and genomic surveillance data to provide a comprehensive analysis of influenza subtypes circulating in the South Tyrol region (Italy) during season 2022/2023, leveraging phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches. Clinical samples were collected from patients exhibiting influenza-like symptoms and evaluated by molecular diagnostics. Whole genome sequencing was conducted, and the hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. A birth-death skyline model was applied to estimate strain-specific effective reproduction numbers (Re) and attack rates. Out of 4891 samples tested, 862 tested positive for influenza, of which 224 genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene revealed A(H3N2) strains predominantly clustering in clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2b, followed by 3C.2a1b.2a.1b. A(H1N1pdm09) strains predominantly clustered in clade 6B.1A.5a.2a. Exclusive circulation of B (Victoria) subtype strains aligned with the global trend, all falling within clade V1A.3a.2. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the strains isolated in the South Tyrol region closely resembled those circulating in the rest of Italy and Austria. Re peaked at 1.16-1.35 (95%CI) for A(H3N2), 1.06-1.34 for A(H1N1pdm09) and 1.02-1.29 for B (Victoria). 95%CI of attack rates were 6.3%-33.5% for A(H3N2), 0.6%-5.0% for A(H1N1pdm09), and 0.8%-6.5% for B (Victoria). Epidemiological estimates from traditional surveillance data can be corroborated by those derived from genomic sequencing, providing more robust assessments of viral transmissibility and attack rates with limited additional effort.

Title: Inhibitory Activity of Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose on Rhinovirus and Influenza A Virus Infection of Human Nasal Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: The nasal epithelium is the primary site for entry of respiratory viruses. In comparison to oral administration, nasal drug applications directed locally to the site of infection can serve as early interventional barriers against respiratory virus pathogenesis by limiting viral spread in the upper airway. Experiments on the diffusion of methylene blue and nanoparticles in both water and low pH conditions revealed that hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) can act as an effective physical barrier. This study also evaluated the activity of HPMC as a barrier against common respiratory viruses, i.e., rhinovirus (RV) and influenza A virus (IAV) using the in vitro human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) model. Utilizing the hNEC infection model, we assessed the protective effects of HPMC in pH 3.5 and pH 7 buffers against RV and IAV. Acidic and pH-neutral buffers and HPMC dissolved in acidic and pH-neutral buffers were administered for 4 h prior to virus infection and at 4 h post-infection (hpi). The apical supernatant was harvested at 24 hpi to determine the viral loads of RV and IAV (H1N1 and H3N2). HPMC was demonstrated to exert protective effects in the infected hNECs independent of acidic pH. Pre-treatment with HPMC in acidic buffer significantly diminished viral loads for both RV and IAV infections of hNECs. Similarly, direct treatment of HPMC in acidic buffer after infection (4 hpi) also effectively decreased viral loads of both RV and IAV. Moreover, treatment using HPMC in acidic buffer before or after infection did not affect the epithelial integrity and ciliary function of hNECs. This study demonstrates the protective effects of HPMC in acidic buffer against RV and IAV infections of the human nasal epithelium.

Title: Evaluating Probenecid or Oseltamivir Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication Through Plaque Assay or Fluorescent Focus Assay Using Non-Structural Protein 1-H1N1 Venus Reporter Virus.
Abstract: It is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of influenza antiviral therapeutics to evaluate their efficacy. Virus plaque assays are commonly used to assess the antiviral effects of drugs on virus replication; however, this method is labor-intensive and can present challenges. We avoided this method by using a replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) expressing a reporter fluorescent gene fused to the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) gene. The reporter IAV was detectable in normal human bronchoepithelial (NHBE) infected cells and offered an improved method to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the antiviral drugs probenecid and oseltamivir compared to a standard plaque assay. This method provides an excellent means for evaluating therapeutic approaches against IAV.

Title: Synergistic Antiviral Activity of Xanthan Gum and Camostat Against Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory infections worldwide. Current preventive measures, though effective for decades, face limitations due to the continuous evolution of viral strains and challenges in targeting specific viral proteins. In this study, we conducted in vivo screenings to evaluate the antiviral properties of various promising polymers to overcome the limitations of current virus infection prevention strategies. Subsequently, we performed detailed physiological and pathological assessments over an extended infection period. In the animal experiments regarding weight loss, a key symptom of viral infection, the group treated with xanthan gum (XG) showed significant suppression of weight loss compared to the untreated group starting from 3 DPI. Throughout the experiment, the treated group maintained a body weight similar to that of the uninfected group. In the virus titration and lung tissue pathology analysis, the group treated with the test substance showed a significantly lower viral load and tissue pathology results closer to normal compared to the untreated group. Additionally, we conducted in vitro combination treatment experiments to evaluate the antiviral ability of XG in conjunction with camostat, a previously known TMPRSS2 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that in the combination-treated groups, XG and camostat exhibited significantly higher cell viability at lower concentrations compared to the single-treatment groups for influenza A H1N1, A H3N2, and B type. These results indicate that XG possesses potential capabilities in inhibiting respiratory viruses and may be utilized in conjunction with existing antiviral treatments.

Title: Exploring the Preventive Potential of Solubilized Sturgeon Oil on Acute Infection with Respiratory Viruses.
Abstract: Acute respiratory viral infections (ARIs) represent a significant global health challenge, contributing heavily to worldwide morbidity and mortality rates. Recent efforts to combat ARIs have focused on developing nasal spray formulations that effectively target the nasal mucosa. However, challenges such as irritation, discomfort, and safety concerns highlight the need for natural, eco-friendly ingredients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of solubilized sturgeon oil (SSO), prepared as an oil-in-water nanoemulsion from Siberian sturgeon, as an eco-friendly preventive nasal spray agent against ARIs. Intranasal pre-treatment with SSO effectively inhibited respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Additionally, it suppressed viral replication in both nasal and lung tissues. This antiviral effect was linked to reduced pulmonary inflammation, characterized by decreased infiltration of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes and Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils, along with lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Histopathological analyses confirmed that nasal SSO administration significantly mitigated lung inflammation progression caused by viral infections. Notably, the protective effects of SSO against SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and RSV persisted for at least six hours following nasal application. These findings highlight SSO as a promising eco-friendly and safe candidate for nasal spray formulations, providing a potential frontline defense against ARIs.

Title: Aging shapes infection profiles of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 in human precision-cut lung slices.
Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines infection profiles and immune responses in lung tissue slices but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Polyphenol rich sugarcane extract restricts select respiratory viruses depending on their mode of entry.
Abstract: We previously showed that Polyphenol rich sugarcane extract (PRSE) displayed significant inhibitory effect against influenza A virus (IAV). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action (MOA) of PRSE against respiratory viruses in human-derived cells. We showed that PRSE treatment does not promote an antiviral state via expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). We subsequently investigated any potential perturbation on the viral entry process and observed that PRSE treatment did not affect caveolin-mediated endocytosis but led to a significant attenuation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We confirmed this inhibitory effect on IAV entry, as infection was unaffected by PRSE when IAV fusion was induced at the plasma membrane, instead of endosomal membranes. Based on these findings we observed significant inhibitory effect of PRSE against respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, which utilise clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but not human parainfluenza virus type 3, which fuses at the plasma membrane. In conclusion, we show that PRSE has broad antiviral activity and potentially perturbs virus entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to inhibit viral replication in vitro.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral mechanism of a sugarcane extract on virus entry but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Nebulized 2-deoxylated glucose analogues inhibit respiratory viral infection in advanced in vitro airway models.
Abstract: Respiratory viral infections, such as those caused by rhinoviruses (RVs) and human corona viruses (HCoV), result in a serious strain on healthcare systems and public health, underscoring an urgent need for inhaled broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. However, their development is challenging, as no standardized in vitro methodologies that can fully replicate the in vivo environment have been established. In this work, we aimed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect of three 2-deoxylated glucose analogues (2-DGA): 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose (2-FDM), by utilizing advanced in vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) airway models. We demonstrated that commonly used ALI models have variable susceptibility to RV, HCoV and influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Further, we showed that 2-DGA have an anti-inflammatory effect and suppress respiratory viral replication in models mimicking the upper and lower respiratory airways. Moreover, we confirmed that 2-DGA can be delivered via nebulization in vitro, highlighting their potential to be used as broad-spectrum inhaled antivirals. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating complex in vitro methodologies, such as primary cell ALI cultures and aerosol exposure, at an early stage of drug development.

Title: Phylogenetic Study of Local Patterns Influenza A(H3N2) Virus Transmission in a Semi-Isolated Population in a Remote Island in Japan Between 2011 and 2013.
Abstract: Influenza A outbreak risk is impacted by the potential for importation and local transmission. Reconstructing transmission history with phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences can help assess outbreak risk but relies on regular collection of genetic sequences. Few influenza genetic sequences are collected in Japan, which makes phylogenetic analysis challenging, especially in rural, remote settings. We generated influenza A genetic sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) samples collected using rapid influenza diagnostic tests and used them to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza in a remote island in Japan. We generated 229 whole genome sequences of influenza A/H3N2 collected during 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons in Kamigoto Island, Japan, of which 178 sequences passed the quality check. We built time-resolved phylogenetic trees from hemagglutinin sequences to classify the circulating clades by comparing the Kamigoto sequences to global sequences. Spatiotemporal transmission patterns were then analyzed for the largest local clusters. Using a time-resolved phylogenetic tree, we showed that the sequences clustered in six independent transmission groups (1 in 2011/12, 5 in 2012/13). Sequences were closely related to strains from mainland Japan. All 2011/12 strains were identified as clade 3C.2 (n = 29), while 2012/13 strains fell into two clades: clade 3C.2 (n = 129) and 3C.3a (n = 20). Clusters reported in 2012/13 circulated simultaneously in the same regions. The spatiotemporal analysis of the largest cluster revealed that while the first sequences were reported in the busiest district of Kamigoto, the later sequences were scattered across the island. Kamigoto Island was exposed to repeated importations of Influenza A(H3N2), mostly from mainland Japan, sometimes leading to local transmission and ultimately outbreaks. As independent groups of sequences overlapped in time and space, cases may be wrongly allocated to the same transmission group in the absence of genomic surveillance, thereby underestimating the risk of importations. Our analysis highlights how NPS could be used to better understand influenza transmission patterns in little-studied settings and improve influenza surveillance in Japan.

Title: Host-targeted repurposed diltiazem enhances the antiviral activity of direct acting antivirals against Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Viral respiratory infections remain a major and recurrent public health threat. Among them, influenza viruses are responsible for ⁓500,000 deaths worldwide and a high economic burden. The recurrent threat of emerging zoonotic or pandemic viruses worsens this scenario, being SARS-CoV-2 and the millions of COVID-19 deaths the most recent example. The rapid evolution of circulating influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses allows the emergence and dissemination of variant strains carrying mutations resulting in suboptimal vaccine protection and/or reduced efficacy of current limited therapeutic arsenal. In this context, host-targeted approaches constitute a promising antiviral strategy aiming to achieve broad-spectrum activity and mitigate the emergence of viral resistance against classic direct acting antivirals. Here, we demonstrated that diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker currently used to treat angor, induces an ISG expression profile characteristic of an antiviral cellular state mainly driven by IFN-λ. We then evaluated the potential of the diltiazem-baloxavir combination against Influenza A wild-type and the PA I38T resistant strain in cell culture and human airway epithelia (HAE). We analogously evaluated the diltiazem-molnupiravir combination against SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern. Our results demonstrate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of diltiazem against Influenza A viruses, including resistant strains, as well as the capacity to potentiate the antiviral effect of baloxavir. The diltiazem-molnupiravir combination further reduced viral production and protected the integrity of HAE infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study highlights the major interest of combining direct acting and host-targeted agents as a promising strategy against circulating and emerging viruses.

Title: Molecular analysis of influenza A(H3N2) in a remote tropical island during 2014-2019 to identify the frequency of introduction and local circulation.
Abstract: The sources of new antigenic Influenza A(H3N2) variants and the role of tropical regions in the global A(H3N2) circulation remain unclear. By conducting molecular analysis, this study aimed to identify A(H3N2) introduction events and the duration of local circulation in a geographically remote tropical island. Nasopharyngeal/nasal samples were collected from symptomatic children under 5 years old in a remote tropical island of the Philippines between 2014 and 2019. From the 330 A(H3N2) strains detected, 150 were sequenced for the Hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) gene. Time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified introduction events from global A(H3N2) circulation. We estimated the duration of local circulation and its association with detected amino acid substitutions. Six different A(H3N2) clades/subclades circulated during the study period. Of the 15 introduction events identified during this period, 13 resulted in local circulation lasting less than 3 months, while one led to 5-month-long circulation. Another 10-month-long local circulation event, by definition, was more likely the result of two distinct introduction events with local circulation lasting less than 3 months, respectively. Most amino acid substitutions that emerged during local circulation were sporadic. No fixed substitutions appeared at the seven key amino acid sites for antigenic changes, suggesting that introduced strains were maintained without the emergence of new antigenic variants. In our study population, A(H3N2) circulation resulted from multiple introduction events, followed by local circulation lasting less than 3 months, with occasional long-term persistence. Our study indicates that tropical regions may contribute to maintaining globally circulating strains but may not be a source of antigenic variants.

Reason: The study focuses on molecular epidemiology and phylogenetics of H3N2 virus introductions and circulation without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Impact of Viral Co-Detection on the Within-Host Viral Diversity of Influenza Patients.
Abstract: Numerous studies have documented the evidence of virus-virus interactions at the population, host, and cellular levels. However, the impact of these interactions on the within-host diversity of influenza viral populations remains unexplored. Our study identified 13 respiratory viral pathogens from the nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPSs) of influenza-like-illness (ILI) patients during the 2012/13 influenza season using multiplex RT-PCR. Subsequent next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A infections revealed all samples as subtype A/H3N2. Out of the 2305 samples tested, 538 (23.3%) were positive for the influenza A virus (IAV), while rhinovirus (RV) and adenoviruses (Adv) were detected in 264 (11.5%) and 44 (1.9%) samples, respectively. Among these, the co-detection of more than one virus was observed in ninety-six samples, and five samples showed co-detections involving more than two viruses. The most frequent viral co-detection was IAV-RV, identified in 48 out of the 96 co-detection cases. Of the total samples, 150 were processed for whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and 132 met the criteria for intra-host single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) calling. Across the genome, 397 unique iSNVs were identified, with most samples containing fewer than five iSNVs at frequencies below 10%. Seven samples had no detectable iSNVs. Notably, the majority of iSNVs (86%) were unique and rarely shared across samples. We conducted a negative binomial regression analysis to examine factors associated with the number of iSNVs detected within hosts. Two age groups-elderly individuals (>64 years old) and school-aged children (6-18 years old)-were significantly associated with higher iSNV counts, with incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.06) and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.01-1.90), respectively. Our findings suggest a minor or negligible contribution of these viral co-detections to the evolution of influenza viruses. However, the data available in this study may not be exhaustive, warranting further, more in-depth investigations to conclusively determine the impact of virus-virus interactions on influenza virus genetic diversity.

Title: Epidemiology and Genetic Evolutionary Analysis of Influenza Virus Among Children in Hainan Island, China, 2021-2023.
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we continuously monitored the epidemiology of influenza virus among pediatric patients from January 2021 to December 2023 in Hainan Island, China. In this study, we collected 54,974 nasopharyngeal swab samples for influenza A Virus (IAV) testing and 53,151 samples for influenza B Virus (IBV) testing from pediatric outpatients. Additionally, we also collected 19,687 nasopharyngeal swab samples from pediatric inpatients for IAV and IBV testing. Outpatient samples were screened for influenza viruses (IVs) infection by the colloidal gold method. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (tNGS) was used to detect influenza virus infections in inpatients. Influenza virus types were identified by analyzing the HA/NA partial regions. The findings revealed a significant decrease in the infection rate of IBV over the specified period, while the infection rate of IAV exhibited a rising trend. Additionally, B/Victoria lineage was the dominant epidemic strain in 2021, while the epidemic strains in 2022 and 2023 underwent a dynamic transformation from A/H3N2 to A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relationships among the circulating strains. Nonetheless, because the sample size is limited, additional research is required. Our findings suggest that the predominant types of influenza viruses in the pediatric population are undergoing dynamic changes, influenced by the implementation and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. These findings highlight the need for adaptive influenza vaccination and containment strategies, particularly in tropical regions like Hainan, where climate and public health policies significantly impact viral transmission patterns. The insights gained from this study could inform more effective public health strategies in similar regions to mitigate the impact of influenza outbreaks in the future.

Title: Comparison of air-liquid interface transwell and airway organoid models for human respiratory virus infection studies.
Abstract: Complex <i>in vitro</i> respiratory models, including air-liquid interface (ALI) transwell cultures and airway organoids, have emerged as promising tools for studying human respiratory virus infections. These models address several limitations of conventional two-dimensional cell line and animal models. However, the lack of standardized protocols for the application of these models in infection studies limits the possibilities for comparing results across different research groups. Therefore, we applied a collaborative approach to harmonize several aspects of experimental methodology between different research laboratories, aiming to assess the comparability of different models of human airway epithelium in the context of respiratory viral infections. In this study, we compared three different models of human respiratory epithelium: a primary human bronchial epithelial cell-derived ALI transwell model, and two airway organoid models established from human airway- and lung-derived adult stem cells. We first assessed the presence of various differentiated cell types using immunofluorescence microscopy. Using a shared stock of influenza A virus, we then assessed viral growth kinetics, epithelial cytokine responses, and serum-mediated inhibition of infection. The presence of club, goblet, and ciliated cells was confirmed in all models. We observed similar viral replication kinetics with a >4-log increase in virus titre across all models using a TCID50 assay. Following infection, a reproducible antiviral cytokine response, including a consistent increase in CXCL10, IL-6, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2/3, and IFN-β, was detected across all models. Finally, neutralization was assessed by pre-incubation of virus with human serum. Reduced viral replication was observed across all models, resulting in a 3- to 6-log decrease in virus titres as quantified by TCID50. In conclusion, all three models produced consistent results regardless of the varying cell sources, culturing approaches, and infection methods. Our collaborative efforts to harmonize infection experiments and compare ALI transwell and airway organoid models described here aid in advancing our understanding and improving the standardization of these complex <i>in vitro</i> respiratory models for future studies.

Title: Molecular Analysis of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Group B Strains Isolated in Kenya Before and During the Emergence of Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1.
Abstract: We conducted a retrospective study to explore molecular insights into human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) group B strains among patients attending outpatient clinics at government medical facilities both prior and during the onset of Influenza A/H1N1/2009 pandemic outbreak. We screened 2300 nasopharyngeal swabs using multiplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We amplified a segment of the first and second hypervariable regions, as well as the conserved portion of the third domain of the G-gene using HRSV-B specific primers, sequenced by Sanger di-deoxy chain termination method and thereafter analyzed the sequences. We characterized the circulating strains into three known genotypes: SAB4 (1.4%), BA7 (1.4%), and multiple variants of BA9 (97.2%). The majority of BA9 viruses were uniquely Kenyan with only 4% aligning with BA9 lineages found elsewhere. The mean evolutionary rate of the HRSV-B was estimated to be 3.08 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year. Our findings indicate that the circulating HRSV-B viruses in Kenya underwent a slower evolution during the period of 2007-2010. Additionally, our findings reveal the existence of a unique lineage as well as new variants that have not been reported elsewhere to date.

Title: Simultaneous coinfection with influenza virus and an arbovirus impedes influenza-specific but not Semliki Forest virus-specific responses.
Abstract: Outbreaks of respiratory virus infections and arbovirus infections both pose a substantial threat to global public health. Clinically, both types of infection range from mild to severe and coinfections may occur more commonly than supposed. Our previous experimental coinfection study in mice demonstrated that prior infection with the arbovirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) negatively impacted immune responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we investigate whether simultaneous coinfection impacts the outcome of immune responses or disease. Simultaneous SFV and IAV infection did not lead to exacerbated or attenuated disease compared with the single virus infection control groups. SFV brain virus titers and brain pathology, including inflammation and immune responses, were comparable in the coinfection and single infection groups. By contrast, there was enhanced IAV replication, but no exacerbated lung pathology in coinfected mice. The magnitude of IAV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in the lungs was lower compared with IAV-only infection. Considered along with our previous study, this study provides evidence that the timing of viral coinfection is pivotal in determining effects on immune responses, pathological changes and disease outcome.

Title: CRISPR editing of candidate host factors that impact influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen with a segmented negative-sense RNA genome that can cause epidemics and pandemics. The host factors required for the complete IAV infectious cycle have not been fully identified. Here, we examined three host factors for their contributions to IAV infectivity. We performed CRISPR-mediated knockout of cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CMAS) as well as CRISPR-mediated overexpression of beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B4GALNT2) and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in the human bronchial epithelial A549 cell line and evaluated the impact on IAV and other RNA viruses. We confirmed that knockout of <i>CMAS</i> or overexpression of <i>B4GALNT2</i> restricts IAV infection by diminishing binding to the cell surface but has no effect on vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Although ADAR1 overexpression does not significantly inhibit IAV replication, it has a pro-viral effect with coxsackie B virus (CVB) infection. This pro-viral effect is not likely secondary to reduced type I interferon (IFN) production, as the induction of the IFN-stimulated genes <i>ISG15</i> and <i>CXCL10</i> is negligible in both parent and ADAR1-overexpressing A549 cells following CVB challenge. In contrast, <i>ISG15</i> and <i>CXCL10</i> production is robust and equal for parent and ADAR1-overexpressing A549 cells challenged with IAV. Taken together, these data provide insights into how host factors can be further explored to understand the dynamics of pro- and anti-viral factors.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A virus (IAV) remains a global threat due to its ability to cause pandemics, making the identification of host factors essential for developing new antiviral strategies. In this study, we utilized CRISPR-based techniques to investigate host factors that impact IAV infectivity. Knockout of CMAS, a key enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis, significantly reduced IAV binding and infection by disrupting sialic acid production on the cell surface. Overexpression of B4GALNT2 had similar effects, conferring resistance to IAV infection through diminished cell-surface binding. Overexpression of ADAR1, known for its role in RNA editing and immune regulation, impacted IAV replication minimally but enhanced coxsackie B virus replication. Such findings reveal the diverse roles of host factors in viral infection, offering insights for targeted therapeutic development against IAV and other pathogens.

Title: Replication-incompetent VSV-based vaccine elicits protective responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses lead to severe respiratory illnesses and death in humans, exacerbated in individuals with underlying health conditions, remaining substantial global public health concerns. Here, we developed a bivalent replication-incompetent single-cycle pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine that incorporates both a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lacking a furin cleavage site and a full-length influenza A virus neuraminidase protein. Vaccination of K18-hACE2 or C57BL/6J mouse models generated durable levels of neutralizing antibodies, T cell responses, and protection from morbidity and mortality upon challenge with either virus. Furthermore, the vaccine provided heterologous protection upon challenge with a different influenza virus strain, supporting the advantage of using NA to increase the breadth of vaccine protection. Now, no bivalent vaccine is approved for use against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Our study supports using this platform to develop safe and efficient vaccines against multiple viruses.

Title: Investigating Pb2 CAP-binding domain inhibitors from marine bacteria for targeting the influenza A H5N1.
Abstract: The ongoing increase in the prevalence and mutation rate of the influenza virus remains a critical global health issue. A promising strategy for antiviral drug development involves targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, specifically the PB2-cap binding domain of Influenza A H5N1. This study employs an in-silico approach to inhibit this domain, crucial for viral replication, using potential inhibitors derived from marine bacterial compounds. Utilizing the MTi-OpenScreen web server, we screened a library of compounds to assess their molecular interactions with the target. This process identified four potential inhibitors: CMNPD25830, CMNPD18675, CMNPD18676, and CMNPD27216. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations, conducted using the Amber software suite, evaluated their binding affinities and dynamic interactions with the PB2 protein. Notably, CMNPD25830 and CMNPD27216 emerged as the most promising candidates, exhibiting higher binding affinities and more favourable interaction profiles compared to the control molecule. Additional analyses, including post-simulation free energy calculations and free energy landscape analysis, strengthened the potential of these compounds as effective PB2-cap binding domain inhibitors. This comprehensive computational investigation identifies CMNPD27216 and CMNPD25830 as standout candidates due to their superior binding energies and dynamic stability, suggesting their strong potential as therapeutic agents against influenza. This research sets the stage for further in vitro validation and optimization of these lead compounds, potentially supporting the development of more effective influenza treatments.

Title: Fluorofurimazine, a novel NanoLuc substrate, enhances real-time tracking of influenza A virus infection without altering pathogenicity in mice.
Abstract: Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using engineered bioluminescent viruses has emerged as a powerful tool for real-time, noninvasive monitoring of viral replication in living animals. While traditional luciferase-based systems, such as firefly luciferase, have been widely used, the NanoLuc luciferase system offers distinct advantages, including its significantly smaller gene size, increased brightness, and independence from ATP as a cofactor, allowing for extracellular detection. However, the utility of NanoLuc has been limited by its traditional substrate, furimazine, which exhibits poor water solubility and potential cytotoxicity. In this study, we assessed fluorofurimazine (FFz), a novel substrate with improved water solubility and bioavailability, for tracking influenza A virus (IAV) replication in mice. Our findings demonstrate that FFz substantially enhances detection sensitivity in both respiratory organs and brain tissue without increasing toxicity, enabling more precise and sustained monitoring of IAV replication. <i>In vitro</i>, FFz generated higher photon flux at lower concentrations compared to furimazine, translating into superior <i>in vivo</i> sensitivity with reduced toxicity. Crucially, FFz did not alter the pathogenicity of IAV in mice, even at sublethal infectious doses, reinforcing its suitability for use in BLI-based viral pathogenicity studies. These results suggest that combining FFz with NanoLuc provides a more effective and less toxic approach for real-time tracking of viral infections in preclinical models. Monitoring viral infections in living animals is a valuable approach for understanding how viruses replicate and cause disease. This study focuses on bioluminescent influenza A virus infection in a mouse model and evaluates fluorofurimazine, a new substrate that enhances bioluminescence imaging. Fluorofurimazine allows researchers to monitor viral spread more effectively than the traditional substrate, furimazine, which is often toxic and less reliable. It offers better sensitivity and lower toxicity, enabling longer and more accurate tracking of viral replication in the lungs and even the brain. Importantly, fluorofurimazine does not alter the pathogenicity of the virus, providing an unaltered representation of the infection process. This advancement has the potential to significantly improve how scientists study bioluminescent viral infections and evaluate antiviral drugs and vaccines, making it a valuable tool for research on influenza and other respiratory viruses.

Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are highly contagious pathogens that cause zoonotic disease with limited availability of antiviral therapies, presenting ongoing challenges to both public health and the livestock industry. Unveiling host proteins that are crucial to the IAV life cycle can help clarify mechanisms of viral replication and identify potential targets for developing alternative host-directed therapies. Using a four-dimensional (4D), label-free methodology coupled with bioinformatics analysis, we analyzed the expression patterns of cellular proteins that changed following H9N2 virus infection. Compared to the control group, the H9N2 infected group displayed 732 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with 298 proteins showing upregulation and 434 proteins showing downregulation. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis showed that DEPs were catalog in 11 biological processes, three cellular components, and eight molecular functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEPs were involved in processes including cytokine signaling pathways induced by virus infection and protein digestion and absorption. Proteins including TP53, DDX58, and STAT3 were among the top hub proteins in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, suggesting that these signaling cascades could be essential for the propagation of IAVs. Furthermore, the host protein SNAPIN was chosen to ascertain the accuracy of expression changes identified through a proteomic analysis. The results indicated that SNAPIN was downregulated following infection with IAVs both in vitro and in vivo, which is consistent with the proteomics results, suggesting that SNAPIN may serve as a key regulatory factor in the viral life cycle of IAVs. Our research delineates an extensive interaction map of IAV infection within the A549 cells, facilitating the discovery of pivotal proteins that contribute to the virus's propagation, potentially offering target candidates to screen for antiviral therapeutics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes host proteomic changes after H9N2 infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Deficient neutrophil responses early in influenza infection promote viral replication and pulmonary inflammation.
Abstract: Neutrophils play key protective roles in influenza infections, yet excessive neutrophilic inflammation is a hallmark of acute lung injury during severe infections. Phenotypic heterogeneity is increasingly recognized in neutrophil populations; however, how functional variation in neutrophils between individuals determine the diverse outcomes of influenza remains unclear. To examine immunologic responses that may drive varying outcomes in influenza, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) and A/J mice with mouse-adapted influenza A virus A/PR/8/34 H1N1. A self-resolving dose in B6 mice was lethal in A/J mice, which had increased viral load throughout infection accompanied by prominent bronchoalveolar neutrophilia and pulmonary vascular leakage preceding mortality. Notably, the B6 mice heavily recruited neutrophils to lungs early in infection while A/J mice failed to do so. Neutrophils from A/J mice additionally displayed reduced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to B6 mice early in infection, suggesting the failure to control virus in A/J mice was a product of deficient neutrophil response. To determine if variation in neutrophils between strains governed viral control and inflammation, we adoptively transferred bone marrow neutrophils from B6 or A/J donors to A/J recipients early in infection and found that the transfer of B6 neutrophils enhanced viral clearance and abrogated the dissemination of CXCL1 and IL-6. The transfer of A/J neutrophils, however, failed to achieve either. Furthermore, B6 neutrophils were capable of greater levels of viral killing in vitro than their A/J counterparts. These results suggest that a key moderator of inflammation in influenza infection is the control of virus by neutrophils early in infection. Thus, host-specific differences in both the recruitment of these cells as well as interindividual variation in neutrophil ability to support viral clearance may in part dictate differing susceptibility to respiratory viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host neutrophil responses affecting viral replication and inflammation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Ecological drivers of evolution of swine influenza in the United States: a review.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a major public health threat due to their wide host range and pandemic potential. Pigs have been proposed as "mixing vessels" for avian, swine, and human IAVs, significantly contributing to influenza ecology. In the United States, IAVs are enzootic in commercial swine farming operations, with numerous genetic and antigenic IAV variants having emerged in the past two decades. However, the dynamics of intensive swine farming systems and their interactions with ecological factors influencing IAV evolution have not been systematically analysed. This review examines the evolution of swine IAVs in commercial farms, highlighting the role of multilevel ecological factors. A total of 61 articles published after 2000 were reviewed, with most studies conducted after 2009 in Midwestern US, followed by Southeast and South-central US. The findings reveal that ecological factors at multiple spatial scales, such as regional transportation networks, interconnectedness of swine operations, farm environments, and presence of high-density, low-genetic diversity herds, can facilitate virus transmission and enhance virus evolution. Additionally, interactions at various interfaces, such as between commercial swine and feral swine, humans, or wild birds contribute to the increase in genetic diversity of swine IAVs. The review underscores the need for comprehensive studies and improved data collection to better understand the ecological dynamics influencing swine IAV evolution. This understanding is crucial for mitigating disease burden in swine production and reducing the risk of zoonotic influenza outbreaks.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of ecological drivers of swine influenza evolution, without explicit new data linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: G-quadruplex-forming small RNA inhibits coronavirus and influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: Future pandemic threats may be caused by novel coronaviruses and influenza A viruses. Here we show that when directly added to a cell culture, 12mer guanine RNA (G12) and its phosphorothioate-linked derivatives (G12(S)), rapidly entered cytoplasm and suppressed the propagation of human coronaviruses and influenza A viruses to between 1/100 and nearly 1/1000 of normal virus infectivity without cellular toxicity and induction of innate immunity. Moreover, G12(S) alleviated the weight loss caused by coronavirus infection in mice. G12(S) might exhibit a stable G-tetrad with left-handed parallel-stranded G-quadruplex, and inhibit the replication process by impeding interaction between viral nucleoproteins and viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Unlike previous antiviral strategies that target the G-quadruplexes of the viral genome, we now show that excess exogenous G-quadruplex-forming small RNA displaces genomic RNA from ribonucleoprotein, effectively inhibiting viral replication. The approach has the potential to facilitate the creation of versatile middle-molecule antivirals featuring lipid nanoparticle-free delivery.

Title: Pharmacologically induced proteolysis of histone deacetylase-6 attenuates influenza virus replication despite limited anti-tumor effects.
Abstract: The protein deacetylase HDAC6 has been controversially linked to cancer cell proliferation and viral propagation. We analyzed whether a pharmacological depletion of HDAC6 with a recent proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) kills tumor cells. We show that low micromolar doses of the cereblon-based PROTAC TH170, but not its inactive analog TH170E, induce proteasomal degradation of HDAC6. The elimination of HDAC6 by TH170 does not compromise leukemia cell growth and survival, DNA integrity, and the stability of selected cancer-relevant proteins. Increasing the doses of TH170 generates a hook-effect on HDAC6 degradation and the apoptosis-associated fragmentation of HDAC6. Unlike the specific elimination of HDAC6 that low doses of TH170 evoke, this fragmentation of HDAC6 is linked to apoptosis and an accumulation of acetylated histones. Thus, like HDAC6 inhibitors, pharmacological degraders of HDAC6 do not induce leukemic cell death unless they are used in non-selective concentrations. Bioinformatic analyses of 91 lymphoid, 37 myeloid, and 125 lung cancer cells in which HDAC6 was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 corroborate these data. HDAC6 is expressed in various bronchus and lung cell types. In a human lung cell model, TH170 reduces influenza A virus replication dependent on the strain and without compromising cell vitality. These data suggest that pharmacologically amenable kinase-independent functions of HDAC6 control viral replication. Eliminating HDAC6 could be a promising anti-viral strategy with a benign impact on host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the effect of pharmacological depletion of a host protein (HDAC6) on influenza virus replication, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: RTP4 restricts influenza A virus infection by targeting the viral NS1 protein.
Abstract: The influenza A virus evades the host innate immune response to establish infection by inhibiting RIG-I activation through its nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Here, we reported that receptor-transporting protein 4 (RTP4), an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), targets NS1 to inhibit influenza A virus infection. Depletion of RTP4 significantly increased influenza A virus multiplication, while NS1-deficient viruses were unaffected. Mechanistically, RTP4 interacts with NS1 in an RNA-dependent manner and sequesters it from the TRIM25-RIG-I complex, thereby restoring TRIM25-mediated RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitination and subsequent activation of IRF3. Antiviral activity of RTP4 requires the evolutionarily conserved CXXC motifs and an H149 residue in the zinc finger domain, mutations of which disrupted RTP4-NS1 interaction and abrogated the ability of RTP4 to rescue RIG-I-mediated signaling. Collectively, our findings provided insights into the mechanism by which an ISG restricts influenza A virus replication by reactivating host antiviral signaling.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host protein RTP4 targeting viral NS1 protein to inhibit infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Modulation of cytokeratin and cytokine/chemokine expression following influenza virus infection of differentiated human tonsillar epithelial cells.
Abstract: The tonsils have been identified as a site of replication for Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, human papillomavirus, and other respiratory viruses. Human tonsil epithelial cells (HTECs) are a heterogeneous group of actively differentiating cells. Here, we investigated the cellular features and susceptibility of differentiated HTECs to specific influenza viruses, including expression of avian-type and mammalian-type sialic acid (SA) receptors, viral replication dynamics, and the associated cytokine secretion profiles. We found that differentiated HTECs possess more abundant α2,3-linked SA (preferentially bound by avian influenza viruses) than α2,6-linked SA (preferentially bound by mammalian strains). This dual receptor expression suggests a role in influenza virus adaptation and tropism within the tonsils by facilitating the binding and entry of multiple influenza virus strains. Our results indicated the susceptibility of differentiated HTECs to a wide range of influenza viruses from human, swine, and avian hosts. Virus production for most strains was detected as early as 1 day post-infection (dpi), and typically peaked by 3 dpi. However, pandemic H1N1 virus showed remarkably delayed replication kinetics that did not peak until at least 7 dpi. Notably, influenza virus infection impacted the expression of cytokeratins in HTEC cultures, which correlated with altered cytokine secretion patterns. These patterns varied within the strains but were most distinct in swine H3N2 infection. In conclusion, differentiated HTECs exhibited a strain-specific pattern of influenza virus replication and innate immune responses that included changes in cytokeratin and cytokine expression. These studies shed light on the complex interplay between influenza viruses and host cells in the tonsils. To develop effective interventions against influenza, it is important to identify host factors affecting pathogenesis and immune responses. Tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs characterized by infiltration of B and T lymphocytes into the squamous epithelium of tonsillar crypts, beneath which germinal centers play key roles in antigen processing and the immune response. Influenza virus tropism in the human upper respiratory tract is a key determinant of host-range, pathogenesis, and transmission. Accordingly, experimental models using primary cells from the human respiratory tract are relevant for assessing virus tropism and replication competence. Our study addresses the dynamics of influenza virus replication in HTECs, including cellular tropism, infectivity, and cytokeratin and cytokine expression. The results of this study highlight the complex interplay between structural proteins and immune signaling pathways, all of which provide valuable insights into host-virus interactions.

Title: Detection and characterisation of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (H5N1/H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4b, Hong Kong SAR, China, 2021 to 2024.
Abstract: We isolated three genotypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) clade 2.3.4.4b from wild birds infected with H5N1 (n = 12) and H5N8 (n = 1) in Hong Kong SAR 2021-2024. Viruses from two spoonbills from late 2022 were genetically related to a virus from a human in China. Four tested viruses exhibited variable virulence in mice but were susceptible to approved antivirals. No neutralising antibody was detected in 63 age-stratified human sera, suggesting potential risk should the virus adapt to humans.

Title: Long-term immune responses induced by low-dose infection with high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses can protect mallards from reinfection with a heterologous strain.
Abstract: Migratory water birds are considered to be carriers of high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). In Japan, mallards are often observed during winter, and HPAIV-infected mallards often shed viruses asymptomatically. In this study, we focused on mallards as potential carriers of HPAIVs and investigated whether individual wild mallards are repeatedly infected with HPAIVs and act as HPAIV carriers multiple times within a season. Mallards were experimentally infected with H5N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs that were isolated recently in Japan and phylogenetically belong to different hemagglutinin groups (G2a, G2b, and G2d). All of these strains are more infectious to mallards than to chickens, and the infected mallards shed enough virus to infect others, regardless of whether they exhibited clinical signs. Serum antibodies to the homologous antigen, induced by a single infection with a low virus dose (10 times the 50% mallard infectious dose), were maintained at detectable levels for 84 days. Immunity at 84 days post-inoculation fully protected the mallards from a challenge with the homologous strain, as demonstrated by a lack of viral shedding, and antibody levels did not increase significantly in most of these birds. Protection against heterologous challenge was also observed despite undetectable levels of antibodies to the challenge strain. Our findings suggest that repeated infections with homologous and heterologous HPAIV strains do not occur frequently in individual wild mallards within a season, particularly at low viral doses, and the frequency with which they act as carriers may be limited.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies immune responses and protection in mallards after infection with different HPAIV strains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Disruption of seasonal influenza circulation and evolution during the 2009 H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics in Southeastern Asia.
Abstract: East, South, and Southeast Asia (together referred to as Southeastern Asia hereafter) have been recognized as critical areas fuelling the global circulation of seasonal influenza. However, the seasonal influenza migration network within Southeastern Asia remains unclear, including how pandemic-related disruptions altered this network. We leveraged genetic, epidemiological, and airline travel data between 2007-2023 to characterise the dispersal patterns of influenza A/H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses both out of and within Southeastern Asia, including during perturbations by the 2009 A/H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent autumn-winter movement waves from Southeastern Asia to temperate regions were interrupted for both subtype/lineages, however the A/H1N1 pandemic only disrupted A/H3N2 spread. We find a higher persistence of A/H3N2 than B/Victoria circulation in Southeastern Asia and identify distinct pandemic-related disruptions in A/H3N2 antigenic evolution between two pandemics, compared to interpandemic levels; similar patterns are observed in B/Victoria using genetic distance. The internal movement structure within Southeastern Asia markedly diverged during the COVID-19 pandemic season, and to a lesser extent, during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic season. Our findings provide insights into the heterogeneous impact of two distinct pandemic-related disruptions on influenza circulation, which can help anticipate the effects of future pandemics and potential mitigation strategies on influenza dynamics.

Title: Respiratory Virus-Specific and Time-Dependent Interference of Adenovirus Type 2, SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus H1N1pdm09 During Viral Dual Co-Infection and Superinfection In Vitro.
Abstract: Understanding the interference patterns of respiratory viruses could be important for shedding light on potential strategies to combat these human infectious agents. To investigate the possible interactions between adenovirus type 2 (AdV2), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) using the A549 cell line. Single infections, co-infections, and superinfections (at 3 and 24 h after the first virus infection) were performed by varying the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Virus replication kinetics and the mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 were assessed by real-time qPCR. Co-infection experiments showed different growth dynamics, depending on the presence of the specific virus and time. AdV2 replication remained stable or possibly enhanced in the presence of co-infection with each of the two H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses used. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 replication was facilitated by H1N1pdm09 but hindered by AdV2, indicating possible different interactions. Finally, H1N1pdm09 replication exhibited variably effectiveness in the presence of AdV2 and SARS-CoV-2. Superinfection experiments showed that the replication of all viruses was affected by time and MOI. The mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 showed divergent results depending on the virus used and the time of infection. Further investigation of co-infection or superinfection may be helpful in understanding the potential relationship involved in the outcome of viral respiratory infection in the human population.

Title: Phlorotannin-Rich <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i> Seaweed Extract Inhibits Influenza Infection.
Abstract: Seaweed-derived compounds are a renewable resource utilised in the manufacturing and food industry. This study focuses on an enriched seaweed extract (ESE) isolated from <i>Ascophyllum nodosum.</i> The ESE was screened for antiviral activity by plaque reduction assays against influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8), A/X-31 H3N2 (X31) and A/England/195/2009 H1N1 (Eng195), resulting in the complete inhibition of infection. Time of addition assays and FACS analysis were used to help determine the modes of action. The therapeutic potential of ESE was then explored using differentiated human bronchiole epithelial cells at the air-liquid interphase and a murine model challenged with IAV. The data indicates that ESE primarily interacts directly with virions, reducing mean virus-cell binding by 79.3% with 0.01 mg/mL ESE. Interestingly, ESE also inhibits the early and late stages of the influenza A lifecycle when treatment occurs after cell binding. This inhibitory effect appears to reduce the internalisation of the virus and the release of progeny virus by targeting neuraminidase activity, with IC50 values of 0.5 μg/mL for X31, 3.2 μg/mL for Eng195 and 12.8 μg/mL for PR8. The intranasal administration of 5 mg/kg ESE in mice infected with IAV reduced the viral load in lung tissue. ESE may be a promising broad-acting antiviral agent in the treatment of influenza infections.

Title: Coinfection of avian hepatitis E virus and different serotypes of fowl adenovirus in chicken flocks in Shaanxi, China.
Abstract: In poultry, fowl adenovirus (FAdV) and co-infected viruses (such as avian hepatitis E virus, aHEV) are likely to cause decreased egg production, inclusion body hepatitis, and pericardial effusion syndrome. From July to September 2023, eight poultry farms of commercial broilers and commercial layers suffered from increased mortality, decreased egg production, and the presence of hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome-like gross lesions in Shaanxi province, China. To determine the source of the infection, the viruses of aHEV, FAdV, avian leukosis virus (ALV), Marek's disease virus (MDV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) were detected. A total of 240 liver samples were collected from eight farms and detected by molecular etiology methods. The samples were tested positive for FAdV and aHEV and negative for NDV, MDV, ALV, and H9N2 AIV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the hexon loop-1 gene showed that these isolates were clustered into three distinct serotypes: FAdV serotype 4 (FAdV-4), FAdV-8a, and FAdV-8b. The partial ORF2 gene sequences obtained in this study shared the highest identity (76%-97%) with corresponding sequences of other known avian HEV isolates and belonged to gene type 3 avian HEV. Meanwhile, the isolated FAdV in this study could multiply in leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells. Overall, the disease may be mainly caused by FAdV and aHEV coinfection on these farms, and this is the first study to discover FAdV-4/8a/8b and avian HEV coinfection in a farm in China. Last year, eight poultry farms of commercial broilers and commercial layers suffered a serious disease in Shaanxi province, China. After molecular etiological investigation, the disease may be mainly caused by fowl adenovirus (FAdV) (FAdV-4, FAdV-8a, and FAdV-8b) and avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV) (genotype 3 avian HEV) coinfection on these flocks, and this is the first study to find FAdV-4/8a/8b and avian HEV coinfection in a farm. It provides a valuable foundation for the prevention and control of FAdV and avian HEV coinfection in chicken farms.

Title: Antiviral Activity of (1<i>S</i>,9a<i>R</i>)-1-[(1,2,3-Triazol-1-yl)methyl]octahydro-1<i>H</i>-quinolizines from the Alkaloid Lupinine.
Abstract: Influenza is a disease of significant morbidity and mortality. The number of anti-influenza drugs is small; many of them stimulate the appearance of resistant strains. This article presents the results of assessing the antiviral activity of 1,2,3-triazole-containing derivatives of alkaloid lupinine for their ability to suppress the reproduction of orthomyxoviruses (influenza viruses: A/Vladivostok/2/09 (H1N1) and A/Almaty/8/98 (H3N2)). The ability of (1<i>S</i>,9a<i>R</i>)-1-[(1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-methyl]octahydro-1<i>H</i>-quinolizines with aryl-, 4-((4-formylphenoxy)methyl)- or 4-((3-tert-butyl-5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-benzoyloxy)methyl)- substituents at the C-4 position of the triazole ring to reduce the infectivity of the virus when processing virus-containing material was established, indicating good prospects for the studied compounds as virucidal agents affecting extracellular virions. The experimental results demonstrated that the triazolyl lupinine derivatives exhibited varying degrees of affinity for both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Furthermore, these compounds demonstrated inhibitory effects on the replication of influenza viruses with different antigenic subtypes. The obtained biological data are in agreement with the results of molecular docking, which showed strong binding energies of the investigated compounds under study with biological targets-hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Following the evaluation of antiviral efficacy among the studied triazolyl derivatives of lupinine, four compounds have been identified for subsequent comprehensive in vitro and in vivo investigations to further elucidate their antiviral properties.

Abstract: This study focuses on the elucidation of the structure and antiviral properties of six nitrogen-containing compounds including amino acid derivates (1 and 2) and heterocyclic compounds (3-6) isolated from the fruiting bodies of Sarcodon imbricatus, particularly Compound 2, an (S)-2-(hydroxyimino)-3-methylpentanoic acid ethyl ester. Their antiviral effects were tested against influenza A virus (IAV) in A549 cells. Particularly, Compound 2 exhibited significant antiviral activity in post-treatment assays, reducing viral protein expression and inhibiting viral replication with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 14.9 μmol/L. Additionally, it demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by reducing levels of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β as well as the oxidative stress induced by IAV infection, while inhibiting necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. Thus, our findings demonstrate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of Compound 2, making it a promising candidate for further research as an anti-influenza agent.

Title: Improved influenza A whole-genome sequencing protocol.
Abstract: Influenza A virus poses significant public health challenges due to its high mutation rate and zoonotic potential. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is crucial for monitoring and characterizing these viruses. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms are commonly used, with ONT being advantageous for its long-read capabilities, portability, and unique ability to access raw data in real-time during sequencing, making it suitable for rapid outbreak responses. This study optimizes the ONT Ligation Sequencing Influenza A Whole Genome protocol by refining RT-PCR kits, primers, and purification methods, and evaluating automation for high-throughput processing. The alternative RT-PCR kits, combined with alternative primers, significantly improved read depth coverage and reduced short, untargeted reads compared to the original ONT protocol. The improvement was particularly evident in the minimum read depth coverage of polymerase segments, which often face challenges with achieving uniform coverage, displaying higher coverage at the 5' and 3' termini, and lower coverage in the central regions. This optimized protocol for targeted influenza A WGS not only enhances sequencing quality and efficiency, but is applicable to all NGS platforms, making it highly valuable for studying influenza adaptation and improving surveillance. Additionally, this protocol can be further refined and adapted for the sequencing of other pathogens, broadening its utility in various pathogen monitoring and response efforts.

Title: SNARE mimicry by the CD225 domain of IFITM3 enables regulation of homotypic late endosome fusion.
Abstract: The CD225/Dispanin superfamily contains membrane proteins that regulate vesicular transport and membrane fusion events required for neurotransmission, glucose transport, and antiviral immunity. However, how the CD225 domain controls membrane trafficking has remained unknown. Here we show that the CD225 domain contains a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with cellular SNARE fusogens. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) encodes a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with neuronal SNARE proteins; mutations in this region disrupt SNARE binding and are linked to neurological disease. Another CD225 member, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), protects cells against influenza A virus infection. IFITM3 interacts with SNARE proteins that mediate late endosome-late endosome (homotypic) fusion and late endosome-lysosome (heterotypic) fusion. IFITM3 binds to syntaxin 7 (STX7) in cells and in vitro, and mutations that abrogate STX7 binding cause loss of antiviral activity against influenza A virus. Mechanistically, IFITM3 disrupts assembly of the SNARE complex controlling homotypic fusion and accelerates the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes. Our results suggest that SNARE modulation plays a previously unrecognized role in the diverse functions performed by CD225 proteins.

Title: Inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase synergize with the broad antiviral activity of 4'-fluorouridine.
Abstract: RNA viruses present a constant threat to human health, often with limited options for vaccination or therapy. Notable examples include influenza viruses and coronaviruses, which have pandemic potential. Filo- and henipaviruses cause more limited outbreaks, but with high case fatality rates. All RNA viruses rely on the activity of a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). An antiviral nucleoside analogue, 4'-Fluorouridine (4'-FlU), targets RdRp and diminishes the replication of several RNA viruses, including influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, through incorporation into nascent viral RNA and delayed chain termination. However, the effective concentration of 4'-FlU varied among different viruses, raising the need to fortify its efficacy. Here we show that inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis, can synergistically enhance the antiviral effect of 4'-FlU against influenza A viruses, SARS-CoV-2, henipaviruses, and Ebola virus. Even 4'-FlU-resistant mutant influenza A virus was re-sensitized towards 4'-FlU by DHODH inhibition. The addition of uridine rescued influenza A virus replication, strongly suggesting uridine depletion as a mechanism of this synergy. 4'-FlU was also highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster model of COVID. We propose that the impairment of endogenous uridine synthesis by DHODH inhibition enhances the incorporation of 4'-FlU into viral RNAs. This strategy may be broadly applicable to enhance the efficacy of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues for antiviral therapy.

Title: The Effects of Viral Structural Proteins on Acidic Phospholipids in Host Membranes.
Abstract: Enveloped viruses rely on host membranes for trafficking and assembly. A substantial body of literature published over the years supports the involvement of cellular membrane lipids in the enveloped virus assembly processes. In particular, the knowledge regarding the relationship between viral structural proteins and acidic phospholipids has been steadily increasing in recent years. In this review, we will briefly review the cellular functions of plasma membrane-associated acidic phospholipids and the mechanisms that regulate their local distribution within this membrane. We will then explore the interplay between viruses and the plasma membrane acidic phospholipids in the context of the assembly process for two enveloped viruses, the influenza A virus (IAV) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Among the proteins encoded by these viruses, three viral structural proteins, IAV hemagglutinin (HA), IAV matrix protein-1 (M1), and HIV-1 Gag protein, are known to interact with acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and/or phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. These interactions regulate the localization of the viral proteins to and/or within the plasma membrane and likely facilitate the clustering of the proteins. On the other hand, these viral proteins, via their ability to multimerize, can also alter the distribution of the lipids and may induce acidic-lipid-enriched membrane domains. We will discuss the potential significance of these interactions in the virus assembly process and the property of the progeny virions. Finally, we will outline key outstanding questions that need to be answered for a better understanding of the relationships between enveloped virus assembly and acidic phospholipids.

Reason: This is a review focusing on viral structural proteins and their interactions with host membrane lipids, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A physical model for M1-mediated influenza A virus assembly.
Abstract: Influenza A virus particles assemble at the plasma membrane of infected cells. During assembly all components of the virus come together in a coordinated manner to deform the membrane into a protrusion eventually forming a new, membrane-enveloped virus. Here, we integrate recent molecular insights of this process, particularly concerning the structure of the matrix protein 1 (M1), within a theoretical framework describing the mechanics of virus assembly. Our model describes M1 polymerization and membrane protrusion formation, explaining why it is efficient for M1 to form long strands assembling into helices in filamentous virions. Eventually, we find how the architecture of M1 helices is controlled by physical properties of viral proteins and the host cell membrane. Finally, by considering the growth force and speed of viral filaments, we propose that the helical geometry of M1 strands might have evolved to optimize for fast and efficient virus assembly and growth.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a theoretical physical model of virus assembly focusing on M1 protein mechanics, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic interventions reshaped the global dispersal of seasonal influenza viruses.
Abstract: The global dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses inform the design of surveillance, intervention, and vaccination strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic's onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on global dispersal and lineage movement of seasonal influenza viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic, without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: The deadly dance of alveolar macrophages and influenza virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the leading causes of respiratory infections. The lack of efficient anti-influenza therapeutics requires a better understanding of how IAV interacts with host cells. Alveolar macrophages are tissue-specific macrophages that play a critical role in lung innate immunity and homeostasis, yet their role during influenza infection remains unclear. First, our review highlights an active IAV replication within alveolar macrophages, despite an abortive viral cycle. Such infection leads to persistent alveolar macrophage inflammation and diminished phagocytic function, alongside direct mitochondrial damage and indirect metabolic shifts in the alveolar micro-environment. We also discuss the "macrophage disappearance reaction", which is a drastic reduction of the alveolar macrophage population observed after influenza infection in mice but debated in humans, with unclear underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we explore the dual nature of alveolar macrophage responses to IAV infection, questioning whether they are deleterious or protective for the host. While IAV may exploit immuno-evasion strategies and induce alveolar macrophage alteration or depletion, this could potentially reduce excessive inflammation and allow for the replacement of more effective cells. Despite these insights, the pathophysiological role of alveolar macrophages during IAV infection in humans remains understudied, urging further exploration to unravel their precise contributions to disease progression and resolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review focusing on alveolar macrophage responses to influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Discriminating North American Swine Influenza Viruses with a Portable, One-Step, Triplex Real-Time RT-PCR Assay, and Portable Sequencing.
Abstract: Swine harbors a genetically diverse population of swine influenza A viruses (IAV-S), with demonstrated potential to transmit to the human population, causing outbreaks and pandemics. Here, we describe the development of a one-step, triplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay that detects and distinguishes the majority of the antigenically distinct influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) clades currently circulating in North American swine, including the IAV-S H1 1A.1 (α), 1A.2 (β), 1A.3 (γ), 1B.2.2 (δ1) and 1B.2.1 (δ2) clades, and the IAV-S H3 2010.1 clade. We performed an in-field test at an exhibition swine show using in-field viral concentration and RNA extraction methodologies and a portable real-time PCR instrument, and rapidly identified three distinct IAV-S clades circulating within the N.A. swine population. Portable sequencing is used to further confirm the results of the in-field test of the swine triplex assay. The IAV-S triplex rRT-PCR assay can be easily transported and used in-field to characterize circulating IAV-S clades in North America, allowing for surveillance and early detection of North American IAV-S with human outbreak and pandemic potential.

Title: Molecular Characterization of a Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus from a 2022 Outbreak in Layer Chickens in the Philippines.
Abstract: H5 subtype high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to devastate the poultry industry and threaten food security and public health. The first outbreak of H5 HPAI in the Philippines was reported in 2017. Since then, H5 HPAI outbreaks have been reported in 2020, 2022, and 2023. Here, we report the first publicly available complete whole-genome sequence of an H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus from a case in Central Luzon. Samples were collected from a flock of layer chickens exhibiting signs of lethargy, droopy wings, and ecchymotic hemorrhages in trachea with excessive mucus exudates. A high mortality rate of 96-100% was observed within the week. Days prior to the high mortality event, migratory birds were observed around the chicken farm. Lungs, spleen, cloacal swabs, and oropharyngeal-tracheal swabs were taken from two chickens from this flock. These samples were positive in quantitative RT-PCR assays for influenza matrix and H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes. To further characterize the virus, the same samples were subjected to whole-virus-genome amplification and sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore method with mean coverages of 19,190 and 2984, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes revealed that the H5N1 HPAI virus from Central Luzon belongs to the Goose/Guangdong lineage clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. Other segments also have high sequence identity and the same genetic lineages as other clade 2.3.4.4b viruses from Asia. Collectively, these data indicate that wild migratory birds are the likely source of H5N1 viruses from the 2022 outbreaks in the Philippines. Thus, biosecurity practices and surveillance for HPAI viruses in both domestic and wild birds should be increased to prevent and mitigate HPAI outbreaks.

Title: Evolution of Influenza A(H3N2) Viruses in Bhutan for Two Consecutive Years, 2022 and 2023.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses pose a significant public health threat globally and are characterized by rapid evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene causing seasonal epidemics. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of A(H3N2) circulating in Bhutan during 2022 and 2023. We analysed 166 whole-genome sequences of influenza A(H3N2) from Bhutan, obtained from the GISAID database. We employed a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, with a curated global dataset of HA sequences from regions with significant migration links to Bhutan. Phylogenetic, temporal, and phylogeographic analyses were conducted to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics and spatial dissemination of the viruses. Our phylogenetic analysis identified the circulation of influenza A(H3N2) Clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 in Bhutan during 2022 and 2023, with viruses further classified into three subclades: 2a.3 (39/166), 2a.3a.1 (58/166) and 2a.3b (69/166). The TMRCA estimates suggest that these viral lineages originated approximately 1.93 years prior to their detection. Phylogeographic analysis indicates introductions from the United States in 2022 and Australia in 2023. The mean evolutionary rate across all gene segments was calculated to be 4.42 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 3.19 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 5.84 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), with evidence of purifying selection and limited genetic diversity. Furthermore, reassortment events were rare, with an estimated rate of 0.045 events per lineage per year. Our findings show that primary forces shaping the local evolution of the influenza A(H3N2) in Bhutan are largely stochastic, with only sporadic instances of adaptive change, and thus underscore the importance of continuous surveillance to mitigate the impact of evolving strains.

Title: Recombinant Influenza A Viruses Expressing Reporter Genes from the Viral NS Segment.
Abstract: Studying influenza A viruses (IAVs) requires secondary experimental procedures to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells or animals. The ability to generate recombinant (r)IAV using reverse genetics techniques has allowed investigators to generate viruses expressing foreign genes, including fluorescent and luciferase proteins. These rIAVs expressing reporter genes have allowed for easily tracking viral infections in cultured cells and animal models of infection without the need for secondary approaches, representing an excellent option to study different aspects in the biology of IAV where expression of reporter genes can be used as a readout of viral replication and spread. Likewise, these reporter-expressing rIAVs provide an excellent opportunity for the rapid identification and characterization of prophylactic and/or therapeutic approaches. To date, rIAV expressing reporter genes from different viral segments have been described in the literature. Among those, rIAV expressing reporter genes from the viral NS segment have been shown to represent an excellent option to track IAV infection in vitro and in vivo, eliminating the need for secondary approaches to identify the presence of the virus. Here, we summarize the status on rIAV expressing traceable reporter genes from the viral NS segment and their applications for in vitro and in vivo influenza research.

Title: Wastewater monitoring of human and avian influenza A viruses in Northern Ireland: a genomic surveillance study.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Although endemic in humans and birds, novel IAV strains can emerge, jump species, and cause epidemics, like the latest variant of H5N1. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown capable of detecting human IAVs. We aimed to assess whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of IAVs from wastewater is possible and can be used to discriminate between circulating strains of human and any non-human IAVs, such as those of avian origin. Using a pan-IAV RT-quantitative PCR assay, six wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) across Northern Ireland were screened from Aug 1 to Dec 5, 2022. A nanopore WGS approach was used to sequence RT-qPCR-positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences relative to currently circulating human and non-human IAVs was performed. For comparative purposes, clinical data (PCR test results) were supplied by The Regional Virus Laboratory, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK). We detected a dynamic IAV signal in wastewater from Sept 5, 2022, onwards across Northern Ireland, which did not show a clear positive relationship with the clinical data obtained for the region. Meta (mixed strain) whole-genome sequences were generated from wastewater samples displaying homology to only human and avian IAV strains. The relative proportion of IAV reads of human versus avian origin differed across time and sample site. A diversity in subtypes and lineages was detected (eg, H1N1, H3N2, and several avian). Avian segment 8 related to those found in recent H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was identified. WBE affords a means to monitor circulating human and avian IAV strains and provide crucial genetic information. As such, WBE can provide rapid, cost-effective, year-round One Health surveillance to help control IAV epidemic and pandemic-related threats. However, optimisation of WBE protocols are necessary to ensure observed wastewater signals not only correlate with clinical case data, but yield information on the wider environmental pan-influenz-ome.

Title: Local patterns of spread of influenza A H3N2 virus in coastal Kenya over a 1-year period revealed through virus sequence data.
Abstract: The patterns of spread of influenza A viruses in local populations in tropical and sub-tropical regions are unclear due to sparsity of representative spatiotemporal sequence data. We sequenced and analyzed 58 influenza A(H3N2) virus genomes sampled between December 2015 and December 2016 from nine health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS), a predominantly rural region, covering approximately 891 km<sup>2</sup> along the Kenyan coastline. The genomes were compared with 1571 contemporaneous global sequences from 75 countries. We observed at least five independent introductions of A(H3N2) viruses into the region during the one-year period, with the importations originating from Africa, Europe, and North America. We also inferred 23 virus location transition events between the nine facilities included in the study. International virus imports into the study area were captured at the facilities of Chasimba, Matsangoni, Mtondia, and Mavueni, while all four exports from the region were captured from the Chasimba facility, all occurring to Africa destinations. A strong spatial clustering of virus strains at all locations was observed associated with local evolution. Our study shows that influenza A(H3N2) virus epidemics in local populations appear to be characterized by limited introductions followed by significant local spread and evolution. Knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within specific populations in understudied tropical and subtropical regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of influenza viruses and to inform vaccination strategies within these populations.

Title: Protein turnover regulation is critical for influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The abundance of a protein is defined by its continuous synthesis and degradation, a process known as protein turnover. Here, we systematically profiled the turnover of proteins in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells using a pulse-chase stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based approach combined with downstream statistical modeling. We identified 1,798 virus-affected proteins with turnover changes (tVAPs) out of 7,739 detected proteins (data available at pulsechase.innatelab.org). In particular, the affected proteins were involved in RNA transcription, splicing and nuclear transport, protein translation and stability, and energy metabolism. Many tVAPs appeared to be known IAV-interacting proteins that regulate virus propagation, such as KPNA6, PPP6C, and POLR2A. Notably, our analysis identified additional IAV host and restriction factors, such as the splicing factor GPKOW, that exhibit significant turnover rate changes while their total abundance is minimally affected. Overall, we show that protein turnover is a critical factor both for virus replication and antiviral defense.
Relevant: False

Title: The Synergistic Effect of Baloxavir and Neuraminidase Inhibitors against Influenza Viruses In Vitro.
Abstract: Influenza viruses remain a major threat to human health. Four classes of drugs have been approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, is a first-line anti-influenza drug, and baloxavir is part of the newest generation of anti-influenza drugs that targets the viral polymerase. The emergence of drug resistance has reduced the efficacy of established antiviral drugs. Combination therapy is one of the options for controlling drug resistance and enhancing therapeutical efficacies. Here, we evaluate the antiviral effects of baloxavir combined with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) against wild-type influenza viruses, as well as influenza viruses with drug-resistance mutations. The combination of baloxavir with NAIs led to significant synergistic effects; however, the combination of baloxavir with laninamivir failed to result in a synergistic effect on influenza B viruses. Considering the rapid emergence of drug resistance to baloxavir, we believe that these results will be beneficial for combined drug use against influenza.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Angelica Tenuissima Nakai against Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The influenza A virus poses a serious threat to human health and is an important global public health issue. The drugs currently used for treatment are becoming increasingly ineffective against influenza A viruses and require the development of new antiviral drugs. Angelica tenuissima Nakai (ATN), a traditional herbal medicine belonging to the Umbelliferae family, exhibits a broad range of pharmacological activities, including inflammation, headache, and cold symptoms. In the present study, based on target protein identification, functional enrichment analysis, and gene set comparisons, we first suggested that ATN has potential therapeutic effects against influenza A virus infection. Next, methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) and sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) assay results revealed that ATN exhibited low cytotoxicity in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The antiviral properties of ATN were observed against H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains. Microscopy confirmed the increased survival rate of the host cells. Further time-of-addition experiments revealed that the addition of ATN before virus adsorption showed similar results to the whole period of treatment. The pre- and co-treated groups showed lower levels of viral RNA (M1 protein). The results of this study suggest that ATN exhibits antiviral properties against the influenza A virus. These therapeutic properties of ATN can serve as a theoretical basis for further research on the applicability of ATN in the development of antiviral agents.

Title: LINC01197 inhibits influenza A virus replication by serving as a PABPC1 decoy.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) significantly impact animal and human health due to their zoonotic potential. A growing body of evidence indicates that the host's long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating host-virus interactions during IAV infection. However, numerous lncRNAs associated with IAV infection have not been well characterised. Here, in this study, we identify the LINC01197 as an antiviral host factor. LINC01197 was significantly upregulated after IAV infection, which is controlled by the NF-κB pathway. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of LINC01197 inhibited IAV replication and virus production, while knockdown of LINC01197 facilitated IAV replication. Mechanistically, LINC01197 directly interacts with poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), which in turn sequesters and restricts its functions. This work shows that LINC01197 acts as a protein decoy, suppressing IAV replication and playing a key role in controlling IAV replication.

Title: Pregnancy enhances antiviral immunity independent of type I IFN but dependent on IL-17-producing γδ<sup>+</sup> T cells in the nasal mucosa.
Abstract: Pregnancy is associated with profound changes in immunity. However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17<sup>+</sup> (IL-17<sup>+</sup>) γδ<sup>+</sup> T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.

Title: GRP78 exerts antiviral function against influenza A virus infection by activating the IFN/JAK-STAT signaling.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection that causes mild to severe illness in humans and animals. Current studies show that glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) can exert crucial functions during viral infection; however, the mechanism by which GRP78 regulates influenza A virus (IAV) infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that IAV infection increased GRP78 expression. Overexpression of GRP78 significantly inhibited IAV replication, as indicated by reduced viral mRNA levels, protein levels, and viral titers. Mechanistically, Type I interferon (IFN) response signaling is upregulated during IAV infection by GRP78. Further study showed that GRP78 interacts with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and enhances its phosphorylation, thereby activating downstream STAT1/2 and antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate an important mechanism by which GRP78 exerts in innate antiviral effect in IAV infection. This mechanism could be used as a therapeutic target for anti-influenza treatment.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host protein GRP78 antiviral function and signaling pathways without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: TMPRSS2-specific antisense oligonucleotides inhibit host cell entry of emerging viruses.
Abstract: Emerging viruses, such as novel influenza A viruses (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose a constant threat to animal and human health. Identification of host cell factors necessary for viral replication but dispensable for cellular survival might reveal novel, attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Proteolytic activation of IAV hemagglutinin (HA) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) by the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSPs), e.g. TMPRSS2 is sought to be critical for viral spread and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the secondary structure of TMPRSS2 mRNA coding sequence and designed TMPRSS2-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Several of these ASOs markedly reduced the TMPRSS2 expression and decreased IAV infection and SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.

Title: Therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza-induced acute lung injury.
Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown anti-inflammatory potential in multiple inflammatory diseases. In the March 2022 issue of the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles, it was shown that EVs from human MSCs can suppress severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and can mitigate the production and release of infectious virions. We therefore hypothesized that MSC-EVs have an anti-viral effect in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. We extended this question to ask whether also other respiratory viral infections could be treated by MSC-EVs. Adipose stem cell-derived EVs (ASC-EVs) were isolated using tangential flow filtration from conditioned media obtained from a multi-flask cell culture system. The effects of the ASC-EVs were tested  in Vero E6 cells in vitro. ASC-EVs were also given i.v. to SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian Hamsters, and H1N1 influenza virus infected mice. The ASC-EVs attenuated SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero E6 cells and reduced body weight and signs of lung injury in infected Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, ASC-EVs increased the survival rate of influenza A-infected mice and attenuated signs of lung injury. In summary, this study suggests that ASC-EVs can have beneficial therapeutic effects in models of virus-infection-associated acute lung injury and may potentially be developed to treat lung injury in humans.

Title: Farmed fur animals harbour viruses with zoonotic spillover potential.
Abstract: Animals such as raccoon dogs, mink and muskrats are farmed for fur and are sometimes used as food or medicinal products<sup>1,2</sup>, yet they are also potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens<sup>3</sup>. Here we performed single-sample metatranscriptomic sequencing of internal tissues from 461 individual fur animals that were found dead due to disease. We characterized 125 virus species, including 36 that were novel and 39 at potentially high risk of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spillover. Notably, we identified seven species of coronaviruses, expanding their known host range, and documented the cross-species transmission of a novel canine respiratory coronavirus to raccoon dogs and of bat HKU5-like coronaviruses to mink, present at a high abundance in lung tissues. Three subtypes of influenza A virus-H1N2, H5N6 and H6N2-were detected in the lungs of guinea pig, mink and muskrat, respectively. Multiple known zoonotic viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and mammalian orthoreovirus<sup>4,5</sup>, were detected in guinea pigs. Raccoon dogs and mink carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses, while viruses from the Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Sedoreoviridae families commonly infected multiple hosts. These data also reveal potential virus transmission between farmed animals and wild animals, and from humans to farmed animals, indicating that fur farming represents an important transmission hub for viral zoonoses.

Title: Detection and spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus H5N1 in the Antarctic Region.
Abstract: Until recent events, the Antarctic was the only major geographical region in which high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) had never previously been detected. Here we report on the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, respectively. We initially detected H5N1 HPAIV in samples collected from brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia on 8th October 2023. Since this detection, mortalities were observed in several avian and mammalian species at multiple sites across South Georgia. Subsequent testing confirmed H5N1 HPAIV across several sampling locations in multiple avian species and two seal species. Simultaneously, we also confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in southern fulmar and black-browed albatross in the Falkland Islands. Genetic assessment of the virus indicates spread from South America, likely through movement of migratory birds. Critically, genetic assessment of sequences from mammalian species demonstrates no increased risk to human populations above that observed in other instances of mammalian infections globally. Here we describe the detection, species impact and genetic composition of the virus and propose both introductory routes and potential long-term impact on avian and mammalian species across the Antarctic region. We also speculate on the threat to specific populations following recent reports in the area.

Title: STING Agonist Induced Innate Immune Responses Drive Anti-Respiratory Virus Activity <i>In Vitro</i> with Limited Antiviral Efficacy <i>In Vivo</i>.
Abstract: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals to treat respiratory tract infections. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key component of innate immune signaling and plays a critical role in protection of the host against viral infections. Previously the STING agonist diABZI-4, a diamidobenzimidazole-based compound, demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV-2 both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. However, its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other respiratory viruses in human airway epithelial cells, which are the primary targets of these infections, is not well established. In this study, we demonstrated that diABZI-4 stimulated robust innate immune responses protecting lung cells against a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, human rhinovirus (HRV), and human parainfluenza virus. diABZI-4 was highly active in physiologically relevant human airway epithelial tissues grown at the air-liquid interface, blocking replication of IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and HRV in these tissues. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with diABZI-4 resulted in the secretion of cytokines that protected the primary airway epithelial cells from IAV infection. Despite the promising <i>in vitro</i> pan-antiviral activity, intranasal administration of diABZI-4 in mice provided early, but not sustained, inhibition of IAV replication in the lungs. These data highlight the complexities of the relationship between timing of STING agonist-driven inflammatory responses and viral replication dynamics, emphasizing the development challenge posed by STING agonists as potential therapeutics against respiratory viruses.

Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a global threat worldwide causing pandemics, epidemics, and seasonal outbreaks. Annual modification of vaccines is costly due to continual shifts in circulating genotypes, leading to inadequate coverage in low- and middle-income countries like India. Additionally, IAVs are evolving resistance to approved antivirals, necessitating a search for alternative treatments. In this study, the antiviral role of the FDA-approved antibiotic minocycline against IAV strains was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by quantifying viral gene expression by qRT-PCR, viral protein levels by Western blotting, and viral titers. Our findings demonstrate that minocycline at a non-toxic dose effectively inhibits IAV replication, regardless of viral strain or cell line. Its antiviral mechanism operates independently of interferon signaling by targeting the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for the export of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Minocycline prevents the assembly and release of infectious viral particles by causing the accumulation of vRNPs within the nucleus. Moreover, minocycline also inhibits IAV-induced late-stage apoptosis, further suppressing viral propagation. The antiviral activity of minocycline against IAVs could offer a promising solution amidst the challenges posed by influenza and the limitations of current treatments.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral mechanism of minocycline on influenza virus replication but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The M2 Protein of the Influenza A Virus Interacts with PEX19 to Facilitate Virus Replication by Disrupting the Function of Peroxisome.
Abstract: The peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19 (PEX19) is necessary for early peroxisomal biogenesis. PEX19 has been implicated in the replication of a variety of viruses, but the details pertaining to the mechanisms of how PEX19 engages in the life cycle of these viruses still need to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that the C terminus of PEX19 interacted with the cytoplasmic tail region of the M2 protein of the influenza A virus (IAV) and inhibited the viral growth titers. IAV infection or PEX19 knockdown triggered a reduction in the peroxisome pool and led to the accumulation of ROS and cell damage, thereby creating favorable conditions for IAV replication. Moreover, a reduction in the peroxisome pool led to the attenuation of early antiviral response mediated by peroxisome MAVS and downstream type III interferons. This study also showed that the interaction between IAV M2 and PEX19 affected the binding of PEX19 to the peroxisome-associated protein PEX14 and peroxisome membrane protein 24 (PMP24). Collectively, our data demonstrate that host factor PEX19 suppresses the replication of the IAV, and the IAV employs its M2 protein to mitigate the restricting role of PEX19.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies interaction between viral M2 protein and host factor PEX19 affecting viral replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in wild rats in Egypt during 2023.
Abstract: We detected highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in wild rats collected from a rural area in Giza, Egypt, near poultry farms, markets, and backyard flocks. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the virus from the rats belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, which has been the predominant virus genotype circulating in Egypt and worldwide since 2021-2022. Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in wild and domestic mammals is recommended to prevent further spread to mammals and humans.

Title: Nasal symbiont Staphylococcus epidermidis restricts influenza A virus replication via the creation of a polyamine-deficient cellular environment.
Abstract: Studies on the immune-regulatory roles played by the commensal microbes residing in the nasal mucosa consider the contribution of antiviral immune responses. Here, we sought to identify the nasal microbiome, Staphylococcus epidermidis-regulated antiviral immune responses and the alteration of polyamine metabolites in nasal epithelium. We found that polyamines were required for the life cycle of influenza A virus (IAV) and depletion of polyamines disturbed IAV replication in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. Inoculation of S. epidermidis also suppressed IAV infection and the concentration of polyamines including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine was completely attenuated in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells. S. epidermidis activated the enzyme involved in the production of ornithine from arginine and downregulated the activity of the enzyme involved in the production of putrescine from ornithine in nasal epithelium. S. epidermidis also induced the activation of enzymes that promote the extracellular export of spermine and spermidine in NHNE cells. Our findings demonstrate that S. epidermidis is shown to be able of creating an intracellular environment lacking polyamines in the nasal epithelium and promote the balance of cellular polyamines in favor of the host to restrict influenza virus replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on how a nasal bacterium affects influenza A virus replication via cellular environment changes, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Indole-core inhibitors of influenza a neuraminidase: iterative medicinal chemistry and molecular modeling.
Abstract: Influenza viruses that cause seasonal and pandemic flu are a permanent health threat. The surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, is crucial for the infectivity of the virus and therefore an attractive target for flu drug discovery campaigns. We have designed and synthesized more than 40 3-indolinone derivatives. We mainly investigated the role of substituents at the 2 position of the core as well as the introduction of substituents or a nitrogen atom in the fused phenyl ring of the core for inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase activity and replication in vitro and in vivo. After evaluating the compounds for their ability to inhibit the viral neuraminidase, six potent inhibitors 3c, 3e, 7c, 12o, 12v, 18d were progressed to evaluate for cytotoxicity and inhibition of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 replication in in MDCK cells. Two hit compounds 3e and 12o were tested in an animal model of influenza virus infection. Molecular mechanism of the 3-indolinone derivatives interactions with the neuraminidase was revealed in molecular dynamic simulations. Proposed inhibitors bind to the 430-cavity that is different from the conventional binding site of commercial compounds. The most promising 3-indolinone inhibitors demonstrate stronger interactions with the neuraminidase in molecular models that supports proposed binding site.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on medicinal chemistry and molecular modeling of neuraminidase inhibitors, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Pertussis toxin-dependent and -independent protection by Bordetella pertussis against influenza.
Abstract: Bacterial-viral co-infections are frequent, but their reciprocal effects are not well understood. Here, we examined the effect Bordetella pertussis infection and the role of pertussis toxin (PT) on influenza A virus (IAV) infection and disease. In C57BL/6J mice, prior nasal administration of virulent B. pertussis BPSM and PT-deficient BPRA provided effective and sustained protection from IAV-induced mortality. However, BPSM or BPRA administered together with purified PT (BPRA + PT) had a stronger protective effect on weight loss compared to BPRA alone, reduced the viral load, and induced IL-17A in the lungs. In IL-17<sup>-/-</sup> mice, BPSM- and BPRA + PT-mediated protection against viral replication was abolished, while BPSM, BPRA and BPRA + PT provided similar levels of protection against IAV-induced mortality and weight loss. In conclusion, B. pertussis infection protects against influenza by two mechanisms: one reducing viral replication depending on PT and IL-17, and the other, independently of PT and IL-17, resulting in protection against influenza disease without reducing the viral load.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of Bordetella pertussis infection on influenza virus infection and disease, focusing on bacterial-viral interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Decoding the RNA viromes in shrew lungs along the eastern coast of China.
Abstract: Shrews being insectivores, serve as natural reservoirs for a wide array of zoonotic viruses, including the recently discovered Langya henipavirus (LayV) in China in 2018. It is crucial to understand the shrew-associated virome, viral diversity, and new viruses. In the current study, we conducted high-throughput sequencing on lung samples obtained from 398 shrews captured along the eastern coast of China, and characterized the high-depth virome of 6 common shrew species (Anourosorex squamipes, Crocidura lasiura, Crocidura shantungensis, Crocidura tanakae, Sorex caecutiens, and Suncus murinus). Our analysis revealed numerous shrew-associated viruses comprising 54 known viruses and 72 new viruses that significantly enhance our understanding of mammalian viruses. Notably, 34 identified viruses possess spillover-risk potential and six were human pathogenic viruses: LayV, influenza A virus (H5N6), rotavirus A, rabies virus, avian paramyxovirus 1, and rat hepatitis E virus. Moreover, ten previously unreported viruses in China were discovered, six among them have spillover-risk potential. Additionally, all 54 known viruses and 12 new viruses had the ability to cross species boundaries. Our data underscore the diversity of shrew-associated viruses and provide a foundation for further studies into tracing and predicting emerging infectious diseases originated from shrews.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes the diversity of viruses in shrew lungs but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Synergistic activity of an RNA polymerase PA-PB1 interaction inhibitor with oseltamivir against human and avian influenza viruses in cell culture and in ovo.
Abstract: In search of novel therapeutic options to treat influenza virus (IV) infections, we previously identified a series of inhibitors that act by disrupting the interactions between the PA and PB1 subunits of the viral RNA polymerase. These compounds showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against human influenza A and B viruses and a high barrier to the induction of drug resistance in vitro. In this short communication, we investigated the effects of combinations of the PA-PB1 interaction inhibitor 54 with oseltamivir carboxylate (OSC), zanamivir (ZA), favipiravir (FPV), and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) on the inhibition of influenza A and B virus replication in vitro. We observed a synergistic effect of the 54/OSC and 54/ZA combinations and an antagonistic effect when 54 was combined with either FPV or BXM. Moreover, we demonstrated the efficacy of 54 against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) both in cell culture and in the embryonated chicken eggs model. Finally, we observed that 54 enhances OSC protective effect against HPAIV replication in the embryonated eggs model. Our findings represent an advance in the development of alternative therapeutic strategies against both human and avian IV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral drug combinations against influenza viruses but does not focus on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Zinc-finger CCHC-type containing protein 8 promotes RNA virus replication by suppressing the type-I interferon responses.
Abstract: Host cells have evolved an intricate regulatory network to fine tune the type-I interferon responses. However, the full picture of this regulatory network remains to be depicted. In this study, we found that knock out of zinc-finger CCHC-type containing protein 8 (ZCCHC8) impairs the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), Sendai virus (Sev), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Further investigation unveiled that ZCCHC8 suppresses the type-I interferon responses by targeting the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway. Mechanistically, ZCCHC8 associates with phosphorylated IRF3 and disrupts the interaction of IRF3 with the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP). Additionally, the direct binding of ZCCHC8 with the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) impairs the ISRE-binding of IRF3. Our study contributes to the comprehensive understanding for the negative regulatory network of the type-I interferon responses and provides valuable insights for the control of multiple viruses from a host-centric perspective.IMPORTANCEThe innate immune responses serve as the initial line of defense against invading pathogens and harmful substances. Negative regulation of the innate immune responses plays an essential role in avoiding auto-immune diseases and over-activated immune responses. Hence, the comprehensive understanding of the negative regulation network for innate immune responses could provide novel therapeutic insights for the control of viral infections and immune dysfunction. In this study, we report that ZCCHC8 negatively regulates the type-I interferon responses. We illustrate that ZCCHC8 impedes the IRF3-CBP association by interacting with phosphorylated IRF3 and competes with IRF3 for binding to ISRE. Our study demonstrates the role of ZCCHC8 in the replication of multiple RNA viruses and contributes to a deeper understanding of the negative regulation system for the type-I interferon responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of a host protein (ZCCHC8) in viral replication and interferon response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 reduces shedding and transmission during <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> co-infection with influenza.
Abstract: Transmission is the first step for a microorganism to establish colonization in the respiratory tract and subsequent development of infectious disease. <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is a leading pathogen that colonizes the mucosal surfaces of the human upper respiratory tract and causes subsequent transmission and invasive infections especially in co-infection with influenza A virus. Host factors contributing to respiratory contagion are poorly understood. Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels have various roles in response to microoorganism. Inhibition of TRPV exacerbates invasive infection by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, but it is unclear how TRPV channels influence pneumococcal transmission. Here, we describe the effect of inhibition of TRPV1 on pneumococcal transmission. We adopted a TRPV1-deficient infant mouse model of pneumococcal transmission during co-infection with influenza A virus. We also analyzed the expression of nasal mucin or pro-inflammatory cytokines. TRPV1 deficiency attenuated pneumococcal transmission and shedding during co-infection with influenza A virus. TRPV1 deficiency suppressed the expression of nasal mucin. In addition, there were increases in the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and type I interferon, followed by the suppressed replication of influenza A virus in TRPV1-deficient mice. Inhibition of TRPV1 was shown to attenuate pneumococcal transmission by reducing shedding through the suppression of nasal mucin during co-infection with influenza A virus. Inhibition of TRPV1 suppressed nasal mucin by modulation of pro-inflammatory responses and regulation of replication of influenza A virus. TRPV1 could be a new target in preventive strategy against pneumococcal transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host factors (TRPV1) affecting bacterial transmission during co-infection with influenza virus, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Ecology and evolution of avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Four types of influenza virus have been identified in nature: influenza A, B, and C viruses are capable of infecting humans, and influenzas A and B cause annual epidemics (seasonal flu) in humans; however, influenza D is currently known to infect only pigs and cattle. The influenza A viruses (IAVs) are of greatest importance to humans, causing widespread significant morbidity and mortality, and have been responsible for at least five pandemics documented since the beginning of the 20th century (Table 1). The H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs continue to circulate in humans as seasonal influenza. In addition to humans, IAVs have a wide range of host animal species in nature, especially wild aquatic birds, the reservoir hosts of IAVs. The IAVs isolated from or adapted to an avian host are named avian influenza viruses (AIVs), and are of great concern owing to their involvement in the genesis of pandemic and outbreak strains. Moreover, the majority of AIVs persist in wild birds and domestic poultry, and novel variants continue to emerge in birds and other hosts, posing non-negligible threats to host ecology and public health.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a general review of ecology and evolution of avian influenza viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Inhibition of RAN attenuates influenza a virus replication and nucleoprotein nuclear export.
Abstract: Nuclear export of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) is a critical step in the influenza A virus (IAV) life cycle and may be an effective target for the development of anti-IAV drugs. The host factor ras-related nuclear protein (RAN) is known to participate in the life cycle of several viruses, but its role in influenza virus replication remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to determine the function of RAN in influenza virus replication using different cell lines and subtype strains. We found that RAN is essential for the nuclear export of vRNP, as it enhances the binding affinity of XPO1 toward the viral nuclear export protein NS2. Depletion of RAN constrained the vRNP complex in the nucleus and attenuated the replication of various subtypes of influenza virus. Using in silico compound screening, we identified that bepotastine could dissociate the RAN-XPO1-vRNP trimeric complex and exhibit potent antiviral activity against influenza virus both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This study demonstrates the important role of RAN in IAV replication and suggests its potential use as an antiviral target.

Title: Screening for anti-influenza virus compounds from traditional Mongolian medicine by GFP-based reporter virus.
Abstract: Screening for effective antiviral compounds from traditional Mongolian medicine not only aids in the research of antiviral mechanisms of traditional medicines, but is also of significant importance for the development of new antiviral drugs targeting influenza A virus. Our study aimed to establish high-throughput, rapid screening methods for antiviral compounds against influenza A virus from abundant resources of Mongolian medicine. The use of GFP-based reporter viruses plays a pivotal role in antiviral drugs screening by enabling rapid and precise identification of compounds that inhibit viral replication. Herein, a GFP-based reporter influenza A virus was used to identify potent anti-influenza compounds within traditional Mongolian medicine. Our study led to the discovery of three active compounds: Cardamonin, Curcumin, and Kaempferide, all of which exhibited significant antiviral properties <i>in vitro</i>. Subsequent analysis confirmed that their effectiveness was largely due to the stimulation of the antiviral signaling pathways of host cells, rather than direct interference with the viral components, such as the viral polymerase. This study showcased the use of GFP-based reporter viruses in high-throughput screening to unearth antiviral agents from traditional Mongolian medicine, which contains rich antiviral compounds and deserves further exploration. Despite certain limitations, fluorescent reporter viruses present substantial potential for antiviral drug screening research due to their high throughput and efficiency.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on screening antiviral compounds from traditional medicine and their effects on host antiviral pathways, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Role of miRNA in Highly Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza Virus Infection: An Emphasis on Cellular and Chicken Models.
Abstract: The avian influenza virus, particularly the H5N1 strain, poses a significant and ongoing threat to both human and animal health. Recent outbreaks have affected domestic and wild birds on a massive scale, raising concerns about the virus' spread to mammals. This review focuses on the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways during the pathogenesis of influenza A virus (IAV), with an emphasis on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viral infections. Current research indicates that miRNAs play a significant role in HPAI H5 infections, influencing various aspects of the disease process. This review aims to synthesize recent findings on the impact of different miRNAs on immune function, viral cytopathogenicity, and respiratory viral replication. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat avian influenza and mitigate its effects on both human and animal populations.

Title: Viral interference between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Some respiratory viruses can cause a viral interference through the activation of the interferon (IFN) pathway that reduces the replication of another virus. Epidemiological studies of coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses have been hampered by non-pharmacological measures applied to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the ease of these interventions, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viruses can now co-circulate. It is thus of prime importance to characterize their interactions. In this work, we investigated viral interference effects between an Omicron variant and a contemporary influenza A/H3N2 strain, in comparison with an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. We infected nasal human airway epitheliums with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, either simultaneously or 24 h apart. Viral load was measured by RT-qPCR and IFN-α/β/λ1/λ2 proteins were quantified by immunoassay. Expression of four interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; OAS1/IFITM3/ISG15/MxA) was also measured by RT-droplet digital PCR. Additionally, susceptibility of each virus to IFN-α/β/λ2 recombinant proteins was determined. Our results showed that influenza A, and especially A/H3N2, interfered with both SARS-CoV-2 viruses, but that SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly interfere with A/H3N2 or A/H1N1. Consistently with these results, influenza, and particularly the A/H3N2 strain, caused a higher production of IFN proteins and expression of ISGs than SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 induced a marginal IFN production and reduced the IFN response during coinfections with influenza. All viruses were susceptible to exogenous IFNs, with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron being less susceptible to type I and type III IFNs, respectively. Thus, influenza A causes a viral interference towards SARS-CoV-2 most likely through an IFN response. The opposite is not necessarily true, and a concurrent infection with both viruses leads to a lower IFN response. Taken together, these results help us to understand how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with another major respiratory pathogen.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on viral interference between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viruses, mainly through interferon responses, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Exploiting the Affimer platform against influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is well known for its pandemic potential. While current surveillance and vaccination strategies are highly effective, therapeutic approaches are often short-lived due to the high mutation rates of IAV. Recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, both against current strains and future IAV pandemics. In addition to mAbs, several antibody-like alternatives exist, which aim to improve upon mAbs. Among these, Affimers stand out for their short development time, high expression levels in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and animal-free production. In this study, we utilized the Affimer platform to isolate and produce specific and potent inhibitors of IAV. Using a monomeric version of the IAV trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein, we isolated 12 Affimers that inhibit IAV infection <i>in vitro</i>. Two of these Affimers were characterized in detail and exhibited nanomolar-binding affinities to the target H3 HA protein, specifically binding to the HA1 head domain. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), employing a novel spray approach to prepare cryo-grids, allowed us to image HA-Affimer complexes. Combined with functional assays, we determined that these Affimers inhibit IAV by blocking the interaction of HA with the host-cell receptor, sialic acid. Furthermore, these Affimers inhibited IAV strains closely related to the one used for their isolation. Overall, our results support the use of Affimers as a viable alternative to existing targeted therapies for IAV and highlight their potential as diagnostic reagents. Influenza A virus is one of the few viruses that can cause devastating pandemics. Due to the high mutation rates of this virus, annual vaccination is required, and antivirals are short-lived. Monoclonal antibodies present a promising approach to tackle influenza virus infections but are associated with some limitations. To improve on this strategy, we explored the Affimer platform, which are antibody-like proteins made in bacteria. By performing phage-display against a monomeric version of influenza virus fusion protein, an established viral target, we were able to isolate Affimers that inhibit influenza virus infection <i>in vitro</i>. We characterized the mechanism of inhibition of the Affimers by using assays targeting different stages of the viral replication cycle. We additionally characterized HA-Affimer complex structure, using a novel approach to prepare samples for cryo-electron microscopy. Overall, these results show that Affimers are a promising tool against influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes the use of Affimers to inhibit influenza A virus infection and characterizes their binding and inhibitory mechanisms but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza viruses in wild birds in Canada following incursions of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus from Eurasia in 2021-2022.
Abstract: Following the detection of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in Newfoundland, Canada, in late 2021, avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in wild birds was scaled up across Canada. Herein, we present the results of Canada's Interagency Surveillance Program for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds during the first year (November 2021-November 2022) following the incursions of HPAIV from Eurasia. The key objectives of the surveillance program were to (i) identify the presence, distribution, and spread of HPAIV and other AIVs; (ii) identify wild bird morbidity and mortality associated with HPAIV; (iii) identify the range of wild bird species infected by HPAIV; and (iv) genetically characterize detected AIV. A total of 6,246 sick and dead wild birds were tested, of which 27.4% were HPAIV positive across 12 taxonomic orders and 80 species. Geographically, HPAIV detections occurred in all Canadian provinces and territories, with the highest numbers in the Atlantic and Central Flyways. Temporally, peak detections differed across flyways, though the national peak occurred in April 2022. In an additional 11,295 asymptomatic harvested or live-captured wild birds, 5.2% were HPAIV positive across 3 taxonomic orders and 19 species. Whole-genome sequencing identified HPAIV of Eurasian origin as most prevalent in the Atlantic Flyway, along with multiple reassortants of mixed Eurasian and North American origins distributed across Canada, with moderate structuring at the flyway scale. Wild birds were victims and reservoirs of HPAIV H5N1 2.3.4.4b, underscoring the importance of surveillance encompassing samples from sick and dead, as well as live and harvested birds, to provide insights into the dynamics and potential impacts of the HPAIV H5N1 outbreak. This dramatic shift in the presence and distribution of HPAIV in wild birds in Canada highlights a need for sustained investment in wild bird surveillance and collaboration across interagency partners. We present the results of Canada's Interagency Surveillance Program for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in the year following the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 on the continent. The surveillance program tested over 17,000 wild birds, both sick and apparently healthy, which revealed spatiotemporal and taxonomic patterns in HPAIV prevalence and mortality across Canada. The significant shift in the presence and distribution of HPAIV in Canada's wild birds underscores the need for sustained investment in wild bird surveillance and collaboration across One Health partners.

Title: The Novel A-Type Proanthocyanidin-Rich Phytocomplex SP4™ Acts as a Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Agent against Human Respiratory Viruses.
Abstract: The appearance of new respiratory virus infections in humans with epidemic or pandemic potential has underscored the urgent need for effective broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs). Bioactive compounds derived from plants may provide a natural source of new BSA candidates. Here, we investigated the novel phytocomplex formulation SP4™ as a candidate direct-acting BSA against major current human respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses and influenza viruses. SP4™ inhibited the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, Influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus in the low-microgram range. Using hCoV-OC43 as a representative respiratory virus, most of the antiviral activity of SP4™ was observed to stem primarily from its dimeric A-type proanthocyanidin (PAC-A) component. Further investigations of the mechanistic mode of action showed SP4™ and its PAC-A-rich fraction to prevent hCoV-OC43 from attaching to target cells and exert virucidal activity. This occurred through their interaction with the spike protein of hCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, thereby interfering with spike functions and leading to the loss of virion infectivity. Overall, these findings support the further development of SP4™ as a candidate BSA of a natural origin for the prevention of human respiratory virus infections.

Title: Red knots in Europe: a dead end host species or a new niche for highly pathogenic avian influenza?
Abstract: The 2020/2021 epidemic in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5 surpassed all previously recorded European outbreaks in size, genotype constellations and reassortment frequency and continued into 2022 and 2023. The causative 2.3.4.4b viral lineage proved to be highly proficient with respect to reassortment with cocirculating low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and seems to establish an endemic status in northern Europe. A specific HPAIV reassortant of the subtype H5N3 was detected almost exclusively in red knots (<i>Calidris canutus islandica</i>) in December 2020. It caused systemic and rapidly fatal disease leading to a singular and self-limiting mass mortality affecting about 3500 birds in the German Wadden Sea, roughly 1 % of the entire flyway population of <i>islandica</i> red knots. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the H5N3 reassortant very likely had formed in red knots and remained confined to this species. While mechanisms of virus circulation in potential reservoir species, dynamics of spill-over and reassortment events and the roles of environmental virus sources remain to be identified, the year-round infection pressure poses severe threats to endangered avian species and prompts adaptation of habitat and species conservation practices.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes epidemiology and phylogenetics of HPAIV in red knots but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genomic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of Influenza A viruses in Colombian swine: implications for one health surveillance and control.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) impose significant respiratory disease burdens in both swine and humans worldwide, with frequent human-to-swine transmission driving viral evolution in pigs and highlighting the risk at the animal-human interface. Therefore, a comprehensive One Health approach (interconnection among human, animal, and environmental health) is needed for IAV prevention, control, and response. Animal influenza genomic surveillance remains limited in many Latin American countries, including Colombia. To address this gap, we genetically characterized 170 swine specimens from Colombia (2011-2017). Whole genome sequencing revealed a predominance of pandemic-like H1N1 lineage, with a minority belonging to H3N2 and H1N2 human seasonal-like lineage and H1N1 early classical swine lineages. Significantly, we have identified reassortant and recombinant viruses (H3N2, H1N1) not previously reported in Colombia. This suggests a broad genotypic viral diversity, likely resulting from reassortment between classical endemic viruses and new introductions established in Colombia's swine population (e.g. the 2009 H1N1 pandemic). Our study highlights the importance of a One Health approach in disease control, particularly in an ecosystem where humans are a main source of IAV to swine populations, and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance and enhanced biosecurity measures. The co-circulation of multiple subtypes in regions with high swine density facilitates viral exchange, underscoring the importance of monitoring viral evolution to inform vaccine selection and public health policies locally and globally.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genomic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of Influenza A viruses in swine, emphasizing surveillance and control, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Sangju Cold Granule exerts anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities against influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Sangju Cold Granule (SJCG) is a classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription described in "Item Differentiation of Warm Febrile Diseases". Historically, SJCG was employed to treat respiratory illnesses. Despite its popular usage, the alleviating effect of SJCG on influenza A virus infection and its mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Influenza is a severe respiratory disease that threatens human health. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of SJCG and the possible molecular mechanism underlying its activity against influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-Q-Exactive was used to identify the components of SJCG. The 50% cytotoxic concentration of SJCG in MDCK and A549 cells were determined using the CCK-8 assay. The activity of SJCG against influenza A virus H1N1 was evaluated in vitro using plaque reduction and progeny virus titer reduction assays. RT-qPCR was performed to obtain the expression levels of inflammatory mediators and the transcriptional regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 in H1N1-infected A549 cells. Then, the mechanism of SJCG effect on viral replication and inflammation was further explored by measuring the expressions of proteins of the RIG-I/NF-kB/IFN(I/III) signaling pathway by Western blot. The impact of SJCG was explored in vivo in an intranasally H1N1-infected BALB/c mouse pneumonia model treated with varying doses of SJCG. The protective role of SJCG in this model was evaluated by survival, body weight monitoring, lung viral titers, lung index, lung histological changes, lung inflammatory mediators, and peripheral blood leukocyte count. The main SJCG chemical constituents were flavonoids, carbohydrates and glycosides, amino acids, peptides, and derivatives, organic acids and derivatives, alkaloids, fatty acyls, and terpenes. The CC<sub>50</sub> of SJCG were 24.43 mg/mL on MDCK cells and 20.54 mg/mL on A549 cells, respectively. In vitro, SJCG significantly inhibited H1N1 replication and reduced the production of TNF-α, IFN-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IP-10, RANTES, TRAIL, and SOCS1 in infected A549 cells. Intracellularly, SJCG reduced the expression of RIG-I, MDA5, P-NF-κB P65 (P-P65), P-IκBα, P-STAT1, P-STAT2, and IRF9. In vivo, SJCG enhanced the survival rate and decreased body weight loss in H1N1-infected mice. Mice with H1N1-induced pneumonia treated with SJCG showed a lower lung viral load and lung index than untreated mice. SJCG effectively alleviated lung damage and reduced the levels of TNF-α, IFN-β, IL-6, IP-10, RANTES, and SOCS1 in lung tissue. Moreover, SJCG significantly ameliorated H1N1-induced leukocyte changes in peripheral blood. SJCG significantly reduced influenza A virus and virus-mediated inflammation through inhibiting the RIG-I/NF-kB/IFN(I/III) signaling pathway. Thus, SJCG could provide an effective TCM for influenza treatment.

Title: Primary nasal influenza infection rewires tissue-scale memory response dynamics.
Abstract: The nasal mucosa is often the initial site of respiratory viral infection, replication, and transmission. Understanding how infection shapes tissue-scale primary and memory responses is critical for designing mucosal therapeutics and vaccines. We generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas of the murine nasal mucosa, sampling three regions during primary influenza infection and rechallenge. Compositional analysis revealed restricted infection to the respiratory mucosa with stepwise changes in immune and epithelial cell subsets and states. We identified and characterized a rare subset of Krt13+ nasal immune-interacting floor epithelial (KNIIFE) cells, which concurrently increased with tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>)-like cells. Proportionality analysis, cell-cell communication inference, and microscopy underscored the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis between KNIIFE and T<sub>RM</sub> cells. Secondary influenza challenge induced accelerated and coordinated myeloid and lymphoid responses without epithelial proliferation. Together, this atlas serves as a reference for viral infection in the upper respiratory tract and highlights the efficacy of local coordinated memory responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune response dynamics and tissue-scale memory responses to influenza infection without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses from 3 co-infected pediatric patients.
Abstract: In Japan, influenza activity was low throughout the COVID-19 pandemic until the 2022-23 season, when the first influenza outbreak occurred since the 2020-21 season. In our influenza surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic, co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus had not been detected; however, in January 2024, we identified three pediatric outpatients co-infected with these viruses: one with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron EG.5 sublineage HK.3 and influenza A(H3N2) and two with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.86 sublineage JN.1.5 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (remdesivir and molnupiravir) and 3C-like protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir), and that of influenza viruses against neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir) and the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. All viruses tested were susceptible to these antiviral drugs and did not possess amino acid substitutions associated with reduced antiviral susceptibility. The patients were treated with anti-influenza drugs and did not develop severe symptoms despite the co-infection. Since SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses continue to evolve, continuous monitoring of their circulation remains essential to assess public health measures and support clinical management.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral susceptibility of co-infecting viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond drug susceptibility.

Title: IAVCP (Influenza A Virus Consensus and Phylogeny): Automatic Identification of the Genomic Sequence of the Influenza A Virus from High-Throughput Sequencing Data.
Abstract: Recently, high-throughput sequencing of influenza A viruses has become a routine test. It should be noted that the extremely high diversity of the influenza A virus complicates the task of determining the sequences of all eight genome segments. For a fast and accurate analysis, it is necessary to select the most suitable reference for each segment. At the same time, there is no standardized method in the field of decoding sequencing results that allows the user to update the sequence databases to which the reads obtained by virus sequencing are compared. The IAVCP (influenza A virus consensus and phylogeny) was developed with the goal of automatically analyzing high-throughput sequencing data of influenza A viruses. Its goals include the extraction of a consensus genome directly from paired raw reads. In addition, the pipeline enables the identification of potential reassortment events in the evolutionary history of the virus of interest by analyzing the topological structure of phylogenetic trees that are automatically reconstructed.

Reason: The paper describes a bioinformatics pipeline for influenza A virus genome assembly and phylogeny but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: First Molecular Detection and Epidemiological Analysis of Equine Influenza Virus in Two Regions of Colombia, 2020-2023.
Abstract: Equine influenza is a viral disease caused by the equine influenza virus (EIV), and according to the WOAH, it is mandatory to report these infections. In Latin America and Colombia, EIV risk factors have not been analyzed. The objective of this research is to perform an epidemiological and molecular analysis of the EIV in horses with respiratory symptoms from 2020 to 2023 in Colombia. Molecular EIV detection was performed using RT-qPCR and nanopore sequencing. A risk analysis was also performed via the GEE method. A total of 188 equines with EIV respiratory symptoms were recruited. The positivity rate was 33.5%. The descriptive analysis showed that only 12.8% of the horses were vaccinated, and measures such as the quarantine and isolation of symptomatic animals accounted for 91.5% and 88.8%, respectively. The variables associated with the EIV were the non-isolation of positive individuals (OR = 8.16, 95% CI (1.52-43.67), <i>p</i> = 0.014) and sharing space with poultry (OR = 2.16, 95% CI (1.09-4.26), <i>p</i> = 0.027). In conclusion, this is the first EIV investigation in symptomatic horses in Colombia, highlighting the presence of the virus in the country and the need to improve preventive and control measures.

Title: Mathematical Modeling Suggests That Monocyte Activity May Drive Sex Disparities during Influenza Infection.
Abstract: In humans, females of reproductive age often experience a more severe disease during influenza A virus infection, which may be due to differences in their innate immune response. Sex-specific outcomes to influenza infection have been recapitulated in mice, enabling researchers to study viral and immune dynamics in vivo in order to identify immune mechanisms that are differently regulated between the sexes. This study is based on the hypothesis that sex-specific outcomes emerge due to differences in the rates/speeds that select immune components respond. Using publicly available sex-specific murine data, we utilized dynamic mathematical models of the innate immune response to identify candidate mechanisms that may lead to increased disease severity in female mice. We implemented a large computational screen using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), wherein the goodness of fit of the competing model scenarios is balanced against complexity (i.e., the number of parameters). Our results suggest that having sex-specific rates for proinflammatory monocyte induction by interferon and monocyte inhibition of virus replication provides the simplest (lowest BIC) explanation for the difference observed in the male and female immune responses. Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and global sensitivity analysis of the top performing scenario were performed to provide rigorous estimates of the sex-specific parameter distributions and to provide insight into which parameters most affect innate immune responses. Simulations using the top-performing model suggest that monocyte activity could be a key target to reduce influenza disease severity in females. Overall, our Bayesian statistical and dynamic modeling approach suggests that monocyte activity and induction parameters are sex-specific and may explain sex-differences in influenza disease immune dynamics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses mathematical modeling to study sex-specific immune responses to influenza infection without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b avian influenza viruses replicate in differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are responsible for disease outbreaks in wild birds and poultry, resulting in devastating losses to the poultry sector. Since 2020, an increasing number of outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 was seen in wild birds. Infections in mammals have become more common, in most cases in carnivores after direct contact with infected birds. Although ruminants were previously not considered a host species for HPAI viruses, in March 2024 multiple outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were detected in goats and cattle in the United States. Here, we have used primary bronchus-derived well-differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells (WD-AECs) cultured at air-liquid interface to assess the susceptibility and permissiveness of bovine epithelial cells to infection with European H5N1 virus isolates. We inoculated bovine WD-AECs with three low-passage HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus isolates and detected rapid increases in viral genome loads and infectious virus during the first 24 h post-inoculation, without substantial cytopathogenic effects. Three days post-inoculation infected cells were still detectable by immunofluorescent staining. These data indicate that multiple lineages of HPAI H5N1 may have the propensity to infect the respiratory tract of cattle and support extension of avian influenza surveillance efforts to ruminants. Furthermore, this study underscores the benefit of WD-AEC cultures for pandemic preparedness by providing a rapid and animal-free assessment of the host range of an emerging pathogen.

Reason: The study focuses on replication of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses in bovine airway epithelial cells but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Research progress on the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza a virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is the leading cause of highly contagious respiratory infections, which poses a serious threat to public health. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is encoded by segment 8 of IAV genome and is expressed in high levels in host cells upon IAV infection. It is the determinant of virulence and has multiple functions by targeting type Ι interferon (IFN-I) and type III interferon (IFN-III) production, disrupting cell apoptosis and autophagy in IAV-infected cells, and regulating the host fitness of influenza viruses. This review will summarize the current research on the NS1 including the structure and related biological functions of the NS1 as well as the interaction between the NS1 and host cells. It is hoped that this will provide some scientific basis for the prevention and control of the influenza virus.

Title: Genetic diversity of H5N1 and H5N2 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in Japan during the winter of 2022-2023.
Abstract: High pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the H5N1 and H5N2 subtypes were responsible for 84 HPAI outbreaks on poultry premises in Japan during October 2022-April 2023. The number of outbreaks during the winter of 2022-2023 is the largest ever reported in Japan. In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyses using the full genetic sequences of HPAIVs isolated in Japan during 2022-2023 and those obtained from a public database to identify their genetic origin. Based on the hemagglutinin genes, these HPAIVs were classified into the G2 group of clade 2.3.4.4b, whose ancestors were H5 HPAIVs that circulated in Europe in late 2020, and were then further divided into three subgroups (G2b, G2d, and G2c). Approximately one-third of these viruses were classified into the G2b and G2d groups, which also included H5N1 HPAIVs detected in Japan during 2021-2022. In contrast, the remaining two-thirds were classified into the G2c group, which originated from H5N1 HPAIVs isolated in Asian countries and Russia during the winter of 2021-2022. Unlike the G2b and G2d viruses, the G2c viruses were first detected in Japan in the fall of 2022. Importantly, G2c viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks throughout Japan over the longest period during the season. Phylogenetic analyses using eight segment genes revealed that G2b, G2d, and G2c viruses were divided into 2, 4, and 11 genotypes, respectively, because they have various internal genes closely related to those of avian influenza viruses detected in wild birds in recent years in Asia, Russia, and North America, respectively. These results suggest that HPAIVs were disseminated among migratory birds, which may have generated numerous reassortant viruses with various gene constellations, resulting in a considerable number of outbreaks during the winter of 2022-2023.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic diversity and phylogenetic classification of H5N1 and H5N2 viruses without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Molecular surveillance of influenza A virus in Saudi Arabia: whole-genome sequencing and metagenomic approaches.
Abstract: Outbreaks of influenza A viruses are generally seasonal and cause annual epidemics worldwide. Due to their frequent reassortment and evolution, annual surveillance is of paramount importance to guide vaccine strategies. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular epidemiology of influenza A virus and nasopharyngeal microbiota composition in infected patients in Saudi Arabia. A total of 103 nasopharyngeal samples from 2015 and 12 samples from 2022 were collected from patients positive for influenza A. Sequencing of influenza A as well as metatranscriptomic analysis of the nasopharyngeal microbiota was conducted using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase segments, and concatenated influenza A genomes was performed using MEGA7. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed changing clades of influenza A virus: from 6B.1 in 2015 to 5a.2a in 2022. One sample containing the antiviral resistance-mediating mutation S247N toward oseltamivir and zanamivir was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed the clustering of influenza A strains with the corresponding vaccine strains in each period, thus suggesting vaccine effectiveness. Principal component analysis and alpha diversity revealed the absence of a relationship between hospital admission status, age, or gender of infected patients and the nasopharyngeal microbial composition, except for the infecting clade 5a.2a. The opportunistic pathogens <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae,</i> and <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i> were the most common species detected. The molecular epidemiology appears to be changing in Saudi Arabia after the COVID-19 pandemic. Antiviral resistance should be carefully monitored in future studies. In addition, the disease severity of patients as well as the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in patients infected with different clades should also be assessed.IMPORTANCEIn this work, we have found that the clade of influenza A virus circulating in Riyadh, KSA, has changed over the last few years from 6B.1 to 5a.2a. Influenza strains clustered with the corresponding vaccine strains in our population, thus emphasizing vaccine effectiveness. Metatranscriptomic analysis showed no correlation between the nasopharyngeal microbiome and the clinical and/or demographic characteristics of infected patients. This is except for the 5a.2a strains isolated post-COVID-19 pandemic. The influenza virus is among the continuously evolving viruses that can cause severe respiratory infections. Continuous surveillance of its molecular diversity and the monitoring of anti-viral-resistant strains are thus of vital importance. Furthermore, exploring potential microbial markers and/or dysbiosis of the nasopharyngeal microbiota during infection could assist in the better management of patients in severe cases.

Title: Using an adaptive modeling framework to identify avian influenza spillover risk at the wild-domestic interface.
Abstract: The wild to domestic bird interface is an important nexus for emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Although the recent incursion of HPAI H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b into North America calls for emergency response and planning given the unprecedented scale, readily available data-driven models are lacking. Here, we provide high resolution spatial and temporal transmission risk models for the contiguous United States. Considering virus host ecology, we included weekly species-level wild waterfowl (Anatidae) abundance and endemic low pathogenic avian influenza virus prevalence metrics in combination with number of poultry farms per commodity type and relative biosecurity risks at two spatial scales: 3 km and county-level. Spillover risk varied across the annual cycle of waterfowl migration and some locations exhibited persistent risk throughout the year given higher poultry production. Validation using wild bird introduction events identified by phylogenetic analysis from 2022 to 2023 HPAI poultry outbreaks indicate strong model performance. The modular nature of our approach lends itself to building upon updated datasets under evolving conditions, testing hypothetical scenarios, or customizing results with proprietary data. This research demonstrates an adaptive approach for developing models to inform preparedness and response as novel outbreaks occur, viruses evolve, and additional data become available.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study of spillover risk using ecological and epidemiological data, without direct genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: CRISPR-Based Assays for Point-of-Need Detection and Subtyping of Influenza.
Abstract: The high disease burden of influenza virus poses a significant threat to human health. Optimized diagnostic technologies that combine speed, sensitivity, and specificity with minimal equipment requirements are urgently needed to detect the many circulating species, subtypes, and variants of influenza at the point of need. Here, we introduce such a method using Streamlined Highlighting of Infections to Navigate Epidemics (SHINE), a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based RNA detection platform. Four SHINE assays were designed and validated for the detection and differentiation of clinically relevant influenza species (A and B) and subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2). When tested on clinical samples, these optimized assays achieved 100% concordance with quantitative RT-PCR. Duplex Cas12a/Cas13a SHINE assays were also developed to detect two targets simultaneously. This study demonstrates the utility of this duplex assay in discriminating two alleles of an oseltamivir resistance (H275Y) mutation as well as in simultaneously detecting influenza A and human RNAse P in patient samples. These assays have the potential to expand influenza detection outside of clinical laboratories for enhanced influenza diagnosis and surveillance.

Title: Molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of avian influenza H5N1 subtype in Nigeria, 2006 to 2021.
Abstract: Nigeria recorded one of the earliest outbreaks of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 in 2006, which spread to other African countries. In 2023, 18 countries reported outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry, with human cases documented in Egypt, Nigeria, and Djibouti. There is limited information on the molecular epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 in Nigeria. We determined the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the virus from 2006 to 2021. We investigated the trend and geographical distribution across Nigeria. The evolutionary history of 61 full-length genomes was performed from 13 countries worldwide, and compared with sequences obtained from the early outbreaks in Nigeria up to 2021. MEGA 11 was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of H5N1 strains, which revealed close ancestry between sequences in Nigeria and those from other African countries. Clade classification was performed using the subspecies classification tool for Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Research Center (BV-BRC) version 3.35.5. H5N1 Clade 2.2 was observed in 2006, with 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1f clades observed afterwards and 2.3.4.4b in 2021. Our findings underscore the need for genomics surveillance to track antigenic variation and clades switching to monitor the epidemiological of the virus and safeguard human and animal health.Impacts Specific variations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of Avian influenza virus are consistent in different geographical regions. H5N1 Clade 2.2 was reported in 2006, with 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1f afterwards and 2.3.4.4b in 2021. Nigeria is an epicentre for avian influenza with three major migratory routes for wild birds transversing the country. It is plausible that the Avian influenza in Northern Nigeria may be linked to wild bird sanctuaries in the region.

Title: Avian influenza viruses in New Zealand wild birds, with an emphasis on subtypes H5 and H7: Their distinctive epidemiology and genomic properties.
Abstract: The rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) viruses in Southeast Asia in 2004 prompted the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries to expand its avian influenza surveillance in wild birds. A total of 18,693 birds were sampled between 2004 and 2020, including migratory shorebirds (in 2004-2009), other coastal species (in 2009-2010), and resident waterfowl (in 2004-2020). No avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from cloacal or oropharyngeal samples from migratory shorebirds or resident coastal species. Two samples from red knots (Calidris canutus) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, but virus could not be isolated and no further characterization could be undertaken. In contrast, 6179 samples from 15,740 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR. Of these, 344 were positive for H5 and 51 for H7. All H5 and H7 viruses detected were of low pathogenicity confirmed by a lack of multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. Twenty H5 viruses (six different neuraminidase [NA] subtypes) and 10 H7 viruses (two different NA subtypes) were propagated and characterized genetically. From H5- or H7-negative samples that tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, 326 AIVs were isolated, representing 41 HA/NA combinations. The most frequently isolated subtypes were H4N6, H3N8, H3N2, and H10N3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of the relations between the location and year of sampling, and presence of AIV in individual waterfowl showed that the AIV risk at a given location varied from year to year. The H5 and H7 isolates both formed monophyletic HA groups. The H5 viruses were most closely related to North American lineages, whereas the H7 viruses formed a sister cluster relationship with wild bird viruses of the Eurasian and Australian lineages. Bayesian analysis indicates that the H5 and H7 viruses have circulated in resident mallards in New Zealand for some time. Correspondingly, we found limited evidence of influenza viruses in the major migratory bird populations visiting New Zealand. Findings suggest a low probability of introduction of HPAI viruses via long-distance bird migration and a unique epidemiology of AIV in New Zealand.

Title: Emergence of Eurasian Avian-Like Swine Influenza A (H1N1) virus in a child in Shandong Province, China.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infections can occur in multiple species. Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses (EAS-H1N1) are predominant in swine and occasionally infect humans. A Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A (H1N1) virus was isolated from a boy who was suffering from fever; this strain was designated A/Shandong-binzhou/01/2021 (H1N1). The aims of this study were to investigate the characteristics of this virus and to draw attention to the need for surveillance of influenza virus infection in swine and humans. Throat-swab specimens were collected and subjected to real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR). Positive clinical specimens were inoculated onto Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to isolate the virus, which was confirmed by a haemagglutination assay. Then, whole-genome sequencing was carried out using an Illumina MiSeq platform, and phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA X software. RT‒PCR revealed that the throat-swab specimens were positive for EAS-H1N1, and the virus was subsequently successfully isolated from MDCK cells; this strain was named A/Shandong-binzhou/01/2021 (H1N1). Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/Shandong-binzhou/01/2021 (H1N1) is a novel triple-reassortant EAS-H1N1 lineage that contains gene segments from EAS-H1N1 (HA and NA), triple-reassortant swine influenza H1N2 virus (NS) and A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses (PB2, PB1, PA, NP and MP). The isolation and analysis of the A/Shandong-binzhou/01/2021 (H1N1) virus provide further evidence that EAS-H1N1 poses a threat to human health, and greater attention should be given to the surveillance of influenza virus infections in swine and humans.

Title: H1N1 nanobody development and therapeutic efficacy verification in H1N1-challenged mice.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes numerous deaths and infections worldwide annually. Therefore, we have considered nanobodies as a potential treatment for patients with severe cases of influenza. We developed a nanobody that was expected to have protective efficacy against the A/California/04/2009 (CA/04; pandemic 2009 flu strain) and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy against CA/04 in mice experiments. This nanobody was derived from the immunization of the alpaca, and the inactivated CA/04 virus was used as an immunogen. We successfully generated a nanobody library through bio-panning, phage ELISA, and Bio-layer interferometry. Moreover, we confirmed that administering nanobodies after lethal doses of CA/04 reduced viral replication in the lungs and influenza-induced clinical signs in mice. These research findings will help to develop nanobodies as viral therapeutics for CA/04 and other infectious viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Genetic Diversity and Detection of Respiratory Viruses Excluding SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Gabon, 2020-2021.
Abstract: Acute respiratory infections are a major global burden in resource-limited countries, including countries in Africa. Although COVID-19 has been well studied since the pandemic emerged in Gabon, Central Africa, less attention has been paid to other respiratory viral diseases, and very little data are available. Herein, we provide the first data on the genetic diversity and detection of 18 major respiratory viruses in Gabon during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 582 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from March 2020 to July 2021, which were SARS-CoV-2 negative, 156 were positive (26%) for the following viruses: enterovirus (20.3%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (4.6%), human coronavirus OC43 (1.2%), human adenovirus (0.9%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (0.5%), influenza A virus (IAV) (0.3%), and human parainfluenza viruses (0.5%). To determine the genetic diversity and transmission route of the viruses, phylogenetic analyses were performed using genome sequences of the detected viruses. The IAV strain detected in this study was genetically similar to strains isolated in the USA, whereas the hMPV strain belonging to the A2b subtype formed a cluster with Kenyan strains. This study provides the first complete genomic sequences of HRV, IAV, and hMPV detected in Gabon, and provides insight into the circulation of respiratory viruses in the country.

Title: Influenza Virus Genomic Surveillance, Arizona, USA, 2023-2024.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and are therefore monitored worldwide in the hope to reduce the burden of disease by annual updates to vaccine recommendations. We conducted genomic sequencing of 110 influenza A and 30 influenza B viruses from specimens collected between October 2023 and February 2024 in Arizona, USA. We identified mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites as well as the neuraminidase (NA) gene in our samples. We also found no unique HA and NA mutations in vaccinated yet influenza-infected individuals. Real-time genomic sequencing surveillance is important to ensure influenza vaccine effectiveness.

Title: Natural Product-Derived Phytochemicals for Influenza A Virus (H1N1) Prevention and Treatment.
Abstract: Influenza A (H1N1) viruses are prone to antigenic mutations and are more variable than other influenza viruses. Therefore, they have caused continuous harm to human public health since the pandemic in 2009 and in recent times. Influenza A (H1N1) can be prevented and treated in various ways, such as direct inhibition of the virus and regulation of human immunity. Among antiviral drugs, the use of natural products in treating influenza has a long history, and natural medicine has been widely considered the focus of development programs for new, safe anti-influenza drugs. In this paper, we focus on influenza A (H1N1) and summarize the natural product-derived phytochemicals for influenza A virus (H1N1) prevention and treatment, including marine natural products, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids and their derivatives, phenols and their derivatives, polysaccharides, and derivatives of natural products for prevention and treatment of influenza A (H1N1) virus. We further discuss the toxicity and antiviral mechanism against influenza A (H1N1) as well as the druggability of natural products. We hope that this review will facilitate the study of the role of natural products against influenza A (H1N1) activity and provide a promising alternative for further anti-influenza A drug development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review summarizes natural product-derived phytochemicals for influenza prevention and treatment without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Inhibition Effects and Mechanisms of Marine Compound Mycophenolic Acid Methyl Ester against Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) can cause infection and illness in a wide range of animals, including humans, poultry, and swine, and cause annual epidemics, resulting in thousands of deaths and millions of hospitalizations all over the world. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-IAV drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity. In this study, the anti-IAV activity of a marine-derived compound mycophenolic acid methyl ester (MAE) was intensively investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that MAE inhibited the replication of different influenza A virus strains in vitro with low cytotoxicity. MAE can mainly block some steps of IAV infection post adsorption. MAE may also inhibit viral replication through activating the cellular Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway. Importantly, oral treatment of MAE can significantly ameliorate pneumonia symptoms and reduce pulmonary viral titers, as well as improving the survival rate of mice, and this was superior to the effect of oseltamivir. In summary, the marine compound MAE possesses anti-IAV effects both in vitro and in vivo, which merits further studies for its development into a novel anti-IAV drug in the future.

Title: Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Seals, St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada<sup>1</sup>.
Abstract: We describe an unusual mortality event caused by a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b involving harbor (Phoca vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus) seals in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada, in 2022. Fifteen (56%) of the seals submitted for necropsy were considered to be fatally infected by HPAI H5N1 containing fully Eurasian or Eurasian/North American genome constellations. Concurrently, presence of large numbers of bird carcasses infected with HPAI H5N1 at seal haul-out sites most likely contributed to the spillover of infection to the seals. Histologic changes included meningoencephalitis (100%), fibrinosuppurative alveolitis, and multiorgan acute necrotizing inflammation. This report of fatal HPAI H5N1 infection in pinnipeds in Canada raises concerns about the expanding host of this virus, the potential for the establishment of a marine mammal reservoir, and the public health risks associated with spillover to mammals.Nous décrivons un événement de mortalité inhabituelle causé par un virus de l'influenza aviaire hautement pathogène A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b chez des phoques communs (Phoca vitulina) et gris (Halichoerus grypus) dans l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent au Québec, Canada, en 2022. Quinze (56%) des phoques soumis pour nécropsie ont été considérés comme étant fatalement infectés par le virus H5N1 de lignées eurasiennes ou de réassortiment eurasiennes/nord-américaines. Un grand nombre simultané de carcasses d'oiseaux infectés par le H5N1 sur les sites d'échouement a probablement contribué à la contamination de ces phoques. Les changements histologiques associés à cette infection incluaient : méningo-encéphalite (100%), alvéolite fibrinosuppurée et inflammation nécrosante aiguë multi-organique.

Title: Exploring the Antiviral Potential of Natural Compounds against Influenza: A Combined Computational and Experimental Approach.
Abstract: The influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which is crucial for viral replication and immune evasion, has been identified as a significant drug target with substantial potential to contribute to the fight against influenza. The emergence of drug-resistant influenza A virus strains highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutics. This study proposes a combined theoretical criterion for the virtual screening of molecular libraries to identify candidate NS1 inhibitors. By applying the criterion to the ZINC Natural Product database, followed by ligand-based virtual screening and molecular docking, we proposed the most promising candidate as a potential NS1 inhibitor. Subsequently, the selected natural compound was experimentally evaluated, revealing measurable virus replication inhibition activity in cell culture. This approach offers a promising avenue for developing novel anti-influenza agents targeting the NS1 protein.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on identifying natural compounds targeting the NS1 protein and their antiviral effects, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Random-Effects Substitution Models for Phylogenetics via Scalable Gradient Approximations.
Abstract: Phylogenetic and discrete-trait evolutionary inference depend heavily on an appropriate characterization of the underlying character substitution process. In this paper, we present random-effects substitution models that extend common continuous-time Markov chain models into a richer class of processes capable of capturing a wider variety of substitution dynamics. As these random-effects substitution models often require many more parameters than their usual counterparts, inference can be both statistically and computationally challenging. Thus, we also propose an efficient approach to compute an approximation to the gradient of the data likelihood with respect to all unknown substitution model parameters. We demonstrate that this approximate gradient enables scaling of sampling-based inference, namely Bayesian inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, under random-effects substitution models across large trees and state-spaces. Applied to a dataset of 583 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, an HKY model with random-effects shows strong signals of nonreversibility in the substitution process, and posterior predictive model checks clearly show that it is a more adequate model than a reversible model. When analyzing the pattern of phylogeographic spread of 1441 influenza A virus (H3N2) sequences between 14 regions, a random-effects phylogeographic substitution model infers that air travel volume adequately predicts almost all dispersal rates. A random-effects state-dependent substitution model reveals no evidence for an effect of arboreality on the swimming mode in the tree frog subfamily Hylinae. Simulations reveal that random-effects substitution models can accommodate both negligible and radical departures from the underlying base substitution model. We show that our gradient-based inference approach is over an order of magnitude more time efficient than conventional approaches.

Reason: This paper presents a methodological advance in phylogenetic substitution models without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Iceland: an underestimated hub for the spread of high-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in the North Atlantic.
Abstract: High-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the goose/Guangdong lineage are enzootically circulating in wild bird populations worldwide. This increases the risk of entry into poultry production and spill-over to mammalian species, including humans. Better understanding of the ecological and epizootiological networks of these viruses is essential to optimize mitigation measures. Based on full genome sequences of 26 HPAIV samples from Iceland, which were collected between spring and autumn 2022, as well as 1 sample from the 2023 summer period, we show that 3 different genotypes of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b were circulating within the wild bird population in Iceland in 2022. Furthermore, in 2023 we observed a novel introduction of HPAIV H5N5 of the same clade to Iceland. The data support the role of Iceland as an utmost northwestern distribution area in Europe that might act also as a potential bridging point for intercontinental spread of HPAIV across the North Atlantic.

Title: Nanopore sequencing of influenza A and B in Oxfordshire and the United Kingdom, 2022-23.
Abstract: We evaluated Nanopore sequencing for influenza surveillance. Influenza A and B PCR-positive samples from hospital patients in Oxfordshire, UK, and a UK-wide population survey from winter 2022-23 underwent Nanopore sequencing following targeted rt-PCR amplification. From 941 infections, successful sequencing was achieved in 292/388 (75 %) available Oxfordshire samples: 231 (79 %) A/H3N2, 53 (18 %) A/H1N1, and 8 (3 %) B/Victoria and in 53/113 (47 %) UK-wide samples. Sequencing was more successful at lower Ct values. Most same-sample replicate sequences had identical haemagglutinin segments (124/141, 88 %); 36/39 (92 %) Illumina vs. Nanopore comparisons were identical, and 3 (8 %) differed by 1 variant. Comparison of Oxfordshire and UK-wide sequences showed frequent inter-regional transmission. Infections were closely-related to 2022-23 vaccine strains. Only one sample had a neuraminidase inhibitor resistance mutation. 849/941 (90 %) Oxfordshire infections were community-acquired. 63/88 (72 %) potentially healthcare-associated cases shared a hospital ward with ≥ 1 known infectious case. 33 epidemiologically-plausible transmission links had sequencing data for both source and recipient: 8 were within ≤ 5 SNPs, of these, 5 (63 %) involved potential sources that were also hospital-acquired. Nanopore influenza sequencing was reproducible and antiviral resistance rare. Inter-regional transmission was common; most infections were genomically similar. Hospital-acquired infections are likely an important source of nosocomial transmission and should be prioritised for infection prevention and control.

Title: Establishment of Swine Primary Nasal, Tracheal, and Bronchial Epithelial Cell Culture Models for the Study of Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: We established primary porcine nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells that recapitulate the physical and functional properties of the respiratory tract and have the ability to fully differentiate. Trans-well cultures demonstrated increased transepithelial electrical resistance over time the presence of tight junctions as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells developed cilia, secreted mucus, and expressed sialic acids on surface glycoproteins, the latter which are required for influenza A virus infection. Swine influenza viruses were shown to replicate efficiently in the primary epithelial cell cultures, supporting the use of these culture models to assess swine influenza and other virus infection. Primary porcine nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cell culture models enable assessment of emerging and novel influenza viruses for pandemic potential as well as mechanistic studies to understand mechanisms of infection, reassortment, and generation of novel virus. As swine are susceptible to infection with multiple viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, these primary airway cell models may enable study of the cellular response to infection by pathogens associated with Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex.

Title: Abundant Intra-Subtype Reassortment Revealed in H13N8 Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a serious threat to global health. On the one hand, these viruses cause seasonal flu outbreaks in humans. On the other hand, they are a zoonotic infection that has the potential to cause a pandemic. The most important natural reservoir of IAVs are waterfowl. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of IAV in birds in the Republic of Buryatia (region in Russia). In 2020, a total of 3018 fecal samples were collected from wild migratory birds near Lake Baikal. Of these samples, 11 were found to be positive for the H13N8 subtype and whole-genome sequencing was performed on them. All samples contained the same virus with the designation A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020. To our knowledge, virus A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 is the first representative of the H13N8 subtype collected on the territory of Russia, the sequence of which is available in the GenBank database. An analysis of reassortments based on the genome sequences of other known viruses has shown that A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 arose as a result of reassortment. In addition, a reassortment most likely occurred several decades ago between the ancestors of the viruses recently collected in China, the Netherlands, the United States and Chile. The presence of such reassortment emphasizes the ongoing evolution of the H13N8 viruses distributed in Europe, North and East Asia, North and South America and Australia. This study underscores the importance of the continued surveillance and research of less-studied influenza subtypes.

Reason: The study focuses on genomic reassortment and evolutionary history of H13N8 influenza viruses without explicit links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Novel Anti-Viral Properties of the Herbal Extract of <i>Davallia mariesii</i> against Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Gu-Sui-Bu, the dried rhizome of <i>Davallia mariesii</i>, is a traditional Chinese herbal remedy with a significant history of treating osteoporosis and inflammatory conditions. However, its potential as an anti-influenza agent and its underlying mechanisms of action remain unexplored. To obtain a more potent extract from <i>D. mariesii</i> and gain insights into its mechanism of action against influenza A virus (IAV), we utilized a partitioning process involving organic solvents and water, resulting in the isolation of butanolic subfractions of the <i>D. mariesii</i> extract (DMBE). DMBE exhibited a broad anti-viral spectrum, effectively inhibiting IAV, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 24.32 ± 6.19 µg/mL and a selectivity index of 6.05. We subsequently conducted a series of in vitro assays to evaluate the antiviral effects of DMBE and to uncover its mechanisms of action. DMBE was found to inhibit IAV during the early stages of infection by hindering the attachment of the virus onto and its penetration into host cells. Importantly, DMBE was observed to hinder IAV-mediated cell-cell fusion. It also inhibited neuraminidase activity, plaque size, and the expression levels of phospho-AKT. In summary, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of <i>D. mariesii</i> as a complementary and alternative herbal remedy against IAV. Specifically, our data highlight DMBE's capabilities in inhibiting viral entry and the release of virions.

Title: Molecular Characterization of Non-H5 and Non-H7 Avian Influenza Viruses from Non-Mallard Migratory Waterbirds of the North American Flyways, 2006-2011.
Abstract: The surveillance of migratory waterbirds (MWs) for avian influenza virus (AIV) is indispensable for the early detection of a potential AIV incursion into poultry. Surveying AIV infections and virus subtypes in understudied MW species could elucidate their role in AIV ecology. Oropharyngeal-cloacal (OPC) swabs were collected from non-mallard MWs between 2006 and 2011. OPC swabs (<i>n</i> = 1158) that molecularly tested positive for AIV (Cts ≤ 32) but tested negative for H5 and H7 subtypes were selected for virus isolation (VI). The selected samples evenly represented birds from all four North American flyways (Pacific, Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic). Eighty-seven low pathogenic AIV isolates, representing 31 sites in 17 states, were recovered from the samples. All isolates belonged to the North American lineage. The samples representing birds from the Central Flyway had the highest VI positive rate (57.5%) compared to those from the other flyways (10.3-17.2%), suggesting that future surveillance can focus on the Central Flyway. Of the isolates, 43.7%, 12.6%, and 10.3% were obtained from blue-winged teal, American wigeon, and American black duck species, respectively. Hatch-year MWs represented the majority of the isolates (70.1%). The most common H and N combinations were H3N8 (23.0%), H4N6 (18.4%), and H4N8 (18.4%). The HA gene between non-mallard and mallard MW isolates during the same time period shared 85.5-99.5% H3 identity and 89.3-99.7% H4 identity. Comparisons between MW (mallard and non-mallard) and poultry H3 and H4 isolates also revealed high similarity (79.0-99.0% and 88.7-98.4%), emphasizing the need for continued AIV surveillance in MWs.

Title: Locations and structures of influenza A virus packaging-associated signals and other functional elements via an in silico pipeline for predicting constrained features in RNA viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus contains regions of its segmented genome associated with ability to package the segments into virions, but many such regions are poorly characterised. We provide detailed predictions of the key locations within these packaging-associated regions, and their structures, by applying a recently-improved pipeline for delineating constrained regions in RNA viruses and applying structural prediction algorithms. We find and characterise other known constrained regions within influenza A genomes, including the region associated with the PA-X frameshift, regions associated with alternative splicing, and constraint around the initiation motif for a truncated PB1 protein, PB1-N92, associated with avian viruses. We further predict the presence of constrained regions that have not previously been described. The extra characterisation our work provides allows investigation of these key regions for drug target potential, and points towards determinants of packaging compatibility between segments.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on in silico prediction of constrained RNA regions related to packaging signals without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Isolation and genetic characterization of multiple genotypes of both H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses from environmental water in the Izumi plain, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan during the 2021/22 winter season.
Abstract: In the 2021/22 winter, one H5N1 and nine H5N8 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of clade 2.3.3.4b were isolated from the water in crane roosts on the Izumi plain, Japan. Additionally, we isolated low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) of five subtypes: H1N1, H4N2, H4N6, H7N7, and H10N4. H5N8 HPAIVs belonging to the G2a group were isolated throughout winter, whereas H5N1 HPAIV belonging to the G2b group were isolated only in early winter. These findings suggest co-circulation of both G2a and G2b HPAIVs in early winter. Although two H7N7 LPAIVs were isolated from cranes' roost water collected on the same day, the gene constellations of the two isolates were clearly different, indicating the contemporary invasion of at least two different genotypes of H7N7 LPAIVs in the Izumi plain. This study underscores the importance of monitoring both HPAIVs and LPAIVs to understand avian influenza virus ecology in migratory waterfowl populations.

Title: Genetic drift and purifying selection shape within-host influenza A virus populations during natural swine infections.
Abstract: Patterns of within-host influenza A virus (IAV) diversity and evolution have been described in natural human infections, but these patterns remain poorly characterized in non-human hosts. Elucidating these dynamics is important to better understand IAV biology and the evolutionary processes that govern spillover into humans. Here, we sampled an IAV outbreak in pigs during a week-long county fair to characterize viral diversity and evolution in this important reservoir host. Nasal wipes were collected on a daily basis from all pigs present at the fair, yielding up to 421 samples per day. Subtyping of PCR-positive samples revealed the co-circulation of H1N1 and H3N2 subtype swine IAVs. PCR-positive samples with robust Ct values were deep-sequenced, yielding 506 sequenced samples from a total of 253 pigs. Based on higher-depth re-sequenced data from a subset of these initially sequenced samples (260 samples from 168 pigs), we characterized patterns of within-host IAV genetic diversity and evolution. We find that IAV genetic diversity in single-subtype infected pigs is low, with the majority of intrahost Single Nucleotide Variants (iSNVs) present at frequencies of <10%. The ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to the number of synonymous iSNVs is significantly lower than under the neutral expectation, indicating that purifying selection shapes patterns of within-host viral diversity in swine. The dynamic turnover of iSNVs and their pronounced frequency changes further indicate that genetic drift also plays an important role in shaping IAV populations within pigs. Taken together, our results highlight similarities in patterns of IAV genetic diversity and evolution between humans and swine, including the role of stochastic processes in shaping within-host IAV dynamics.

Title: Interaction and antiviral treatment of coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in vitro.
Abstract: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has lasted for three years. Coinfection with seasonal influenza may occur resulting in more severe diseases. The interaction between these two viruses for infection and the effect of antiviral treatment remains unclear. A SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1 coinfection model on Calu-3 cell line was established, upon which the simultaneous and sequential coinfection was evaluated by comparing the viral load. The efficacy of molnupiravir and baloxavir against individual virus and coinfection were also studied. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly interfered when the influenza virus was infected simultaneously or in advance (p < 0.05). On the contrary, the replication of the influenza virus was not affected by the SARS-CoV-2. Molnupiravir monotherapy had significant inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 when the concentration reached to 6.25 μM but did not show any significant anti-influenza activity. Baloxavir was effective against influenza within the dosage range and showed significant effect of anti-SARS-CoV-2 at 16 μM. In the treatment of coinfection, molnupiravir had significant effect for SARS-CoV-2 from 6.25 μM to 100 μM and inhibited H1N1 at 100 μM (p < 0.05). The tested dosage range of baloxavir can inhibit H1N1 significantly (p < 0.05), while at the highest concentration of baloxavir did not further inhibit SARS-CoV-2, and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 significantly increased in lower concentrations. Combination treatment can effectively inhibit influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 replication during coinfection. Compared with molnupiravir or baloxavir monotherapy, combination therapy was more effective in less dosage to inhibit the replication of both viruses. In coinfection, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 would be interfered by influenza H1N1. Compared with molnupiravir or baloxavir monotherapy, treatment with a combination of molnupiravir and baloxavir should be considered for early treatment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates viral interactions and antiviral treatment effects in coinfection models but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of genome-wide pooled CRISPR screens to identify host factors involved in influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The host-virus interactome is increasingly recognized as an important research field to discover new therapeutic targets to treat influenza. Multiple pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas screens have been reported to identify new pro- and antiviral host factors of the influenza A virus. However, at present, a comprehensive summary of the results is lacking. We performed a systematic review of all reported CRISPR studies in this field in combination with a meta-analysis using the algorithm of meta-analysis by information content (MAIC). Two ranked gene lists were generated based on evidence in 15 proviral and 4 antiviral screens. Enriched pathways in the proviral MAIC results were compared to those of a prior array-based RNA interference (RNAi) meta-analysis. The top 50 proviral MAIC list contained genes whose role requires further elucidation, such as the endosomal ion channel <i>TPCN1</i> and the kinase <i>WEE1</i>. Moreover, MAIC indicated that <i>ALYREF</i>, a component of the transcription export complex, has antiviral properties, whereas former knockdown experiments attributed a proviral role to this host factor. CRISPR-Cas-pooled screens displayed a bias toward early-replication events, whereas the prior RNAi meta-analysis covered early and late-stage events. RNAi screens led to the identification of a larger fraction of essential genes than CRISPR screens. In summary, the MAIC algorithm points toward the importance of several less well-known pathways in host-influenza virus interactions that merit further investigation. The results from this meta-analysis of CRISPR screens in influenza A virus infection may help guide future research efforts to develop host-directed anti-influenza drugs. Viruses rely on host factors for their replication, whereas the host cell has evolved virus restriction factors. These factors represent potential targets for host-oriented antiviral therapies. Multiple pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas screens have been reported to identify pro- and antiviral host factors in the context of influenza virus infection. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of these screens based on the publicly available gene lists, using the recently developed algorithm meta-analysis by information content (MAIC). MAIC allows the systematic integration of ranked and unranked gene lists into a final ranked gene list. This approach highlighted poorly characterized host factors and pathways with evidence from multiple screens, such as the vesicle docking and lipid metabolism pathways, which merit further exploration.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a meta-analysis of host factors identified by CRISPR screens affecting influenza infection, focusing on host genetics rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A computational approach to design a multiepitope vaccine against H5N1 virus.
Abstract: Since 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, have been recognized as a possible pandemic hazard to men and the poultry business. The rapid rate of mutation of H5N1 viruses makes the whole process of designing vaccines extremely challenging. Here, we used an in silico approach to design a multi-epitope vaccine against H5N1 influenza A virus using hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens. B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) were predicted via IEDB, NetMHC-4 and NetMHCII-2.3 respectively. Two adjuvants consisting of Human β-defensin-3 (HβD-3) along with pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) have been chosen to induce more immune response. Linkers including KK, AAY, HEYGAEALERAG, GPGPGPG and double EAAAK were utilized to link epitopes and adjuvants. This construct encodes a protein having 350 amino acids and 38.46 kDa molecular weight. Antigenicity of ~ 1, the allergenicity of non-allergen, toxicity of negative and solubility of appropriate were confirmed through Vaxigen, AllerTOP, ToxDL and DeepSoluE, respectively. The 3D structure of H5N1 was refined and validated with a Z-Score of - 0.87 and an overall Ramachandran of 99.7%. Docking analysis showed H5N1 could interact with TLR7 (docking score of - 374.08 and by 4 hydrogen bonds) and TLR8 (docking score of - 414.39 and by 3 hydrogen bonds). Molecular dynamics simulations results showed RMSD and RMSF of 0.25 nm and 0.2 for H5N1-TLR7 as well as RMSD and RMSF of 0.45 nm and 0.4 for H5N1-TLR8 complexes, respectively. Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) confirmed stability and continuity of interaction between H5N1-TLR7 with the total binding energy of - 29.97 kJ/mol and H5N1-TLR8 with the total binding energy of - 23.9 kJ/mol. Investigating immune response simulation predicted evidence of the ability to stimulate T and B cells of the immunity system that shows the merits of this H5N1 vaccine proposed candidate for clinical trials.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on in silico design of a multi-epitope vaccine and immune response simulation without direct experimental linkage of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Changing and Evolution of Influenza Virus: Is It a Trivial Flu?
Abstract: Influenza viruses are etiological agents which cause contagious respiratory, seasonal epidemics and, for influenza A subtypes, pandemics. The clinical picture of influenza has undergone continuous change over the years, due to intrinsic viral evolution as well as "reassortment" of its genomic segments. The history of influenza highlights its ability to adapt and to rapidly evolve, without specific circumstances. This reflects the complexity of this pathology and poses the fundamental question about its assumption as a "common illness" and its impact on public health. The global influenza epidemics and pandemics claimed millions of deaths, leaving an indelible mark on public health and showing the need for a better comprehension of the influenza virus. The clear understanding of genetic variations during the influenza seasonal epidemics is a crucial point for developing effective strategies for prevention, treatment, and vaccine design. The recent advance in next-generation sequencing approaches, model systems to virus culture, and bioinformatics pipeline played a key role in the rapid characterization of circulating influenza strains. In particular, the increase in computational power allowed the performance of complex tasks in healthcare settings through machine learning algorithms, which analyze different variables, such as medical and laboratory outputs, to optimize medical research and improve public health systems. The early detection of emerging and reemerging pathogens is a matter of importance to prevent future pandemics. The perception of influenza as a "trivial flu" or a more serious public health concern is a subject of ongoing debate, reflecting the multifaceted nature of this infectious disease. The variability in the severity of influenza sheds light on the unpredictability of the viral characteristics, coupled with the challenges in accurately predicting circulating strains. This adds complexity to the public health burden of influenza and highlights the need for targeted interventions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus evolution and public health impact without explicit experimental or analytical links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The Influenza A Virus Replication Cycle: A Comprehensive Review.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is the primary causative agent of influenza, colloquially called the flu. Each year, it infects up to a billion people, resulting in hundreds of thousands of human deaths, and causes devastating avian outbreaks with worldwide losses worth billions of dollars. Always present is the possibility that a highly pathogenic novel subtype capable of direct human-to-human transmission will spill over into humans, causing a pandemic as devastating if not more so than the 1918 influenza pandemic. While antiviral drugs for influenza do exist, they target very few aspects of IAV replication and risk becoming obsolete due to antiviral resistance. Antivirals targeting other areas of IAV replication are needed to overcome this resistance and combat the yearly epidemics, which exact a serious toll worldwide. This review aims to summarise the key steps in the IAV replication cycle, along with highlighting areas of research that need more focus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a general review of the influenza A virus replication cycle without explicit focus on linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Hydroxypropyl-Beta Cyclodextrin Barrier Prevents Respiratory Viral Infections: A Preclinical Study.
Abstract: The emergence and mutation of pathogenic viruses have been occurring at an unprecedented rate in recent decades. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global public health crisis due to extensive viral transmission. In situ RNA mapping has revealed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression to be highest in the nose and lower in the lung, pointing to nasal susceptibility as a predominant route for infection and the cause of subsequent pulmonary effects. By blocking viral attachment and entry at the nasal airway using a cyclodextrin-based formulation, a preventative therapy can be developed to reduce viral infection at the site of entry. Here, we assess the safety and antiviral efficacy of cyclodextrin-based formulations. From these studies, hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and hydroxypropyl gamma-cyclodextrin (HPGCD) were then further evaluated for antiviral effects using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Efficacy findings were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infection of Calu-3 cells and using a K18-hACE2 murine model. Intranasal pre-treatment with HPBCD-based formulations reduced viral load and inflammatory signaling in the lung. In vitro efficacy studies were further conducted using lentiviruses, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and influenza A virus subtype H1N1. These findings suggest HPBCD may be used as an agnostic barrier against transmissible pathogens, including but not limited to SARS-CoV-2.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates the antiviral efficacy of cyclodextrin-based formulations against viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b from Peru forms a monophyletic group with Chilean isolates in South America.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian Influenza virus (HPAIV) has spread in an unprecedented extent globally in recent years. Despite the large reports of cases in Asia, Europe, and North America, little is known about its circulation in South America. Here, we describe the isolation, and whole genome characterization of HPAIV obtained from sampling 26 wild bird species in Peru, representing one of the largest studies in our region following the latest HPAIV introduction in South America. Out of 147 samples analyzed, 22 were positive for detection of avian influenza virus using a qRT-PCR-based assay. Following inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs, fourteen viral isolates were obtained from which nine isolates were selected for genome characterization, based on their host relevance. Our results identified the presence of HPAIV H5N1 subtype in a highly diverse wild bird species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates correspond to the clade 2.3.4.4b, sharing a common ancestor with North American isolates and forming a monophyletic group along with isolates from Chile. Altogether, changes at the amino acid levels compared to their closest relatives indicates the virus is evolving locally, highlighting the need for constant genomic surveillance. This data evidence the chances for spillover events increases as the virus spreads into large populations of immunologically naïve avian species and adding conditions for cross species transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and genomic surveillance without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes such as pathogenicity or transmissibility.

Title: HPAIV outbreak triggers short-term colony connectivity in a seabird metapopulation.
Abstract: Disease outbreaks can drastically disturb the environment of surviving animals, but the behavioural, ecological, and epidemiological consequences of disease-driven disturbance are poorly understood. Here, we show that an outbreak of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) coincided with unprecedented short-term behavioural changes in Northern gannets (Morus bassanus). Breeding gannets show characteristically strong fidelity to their nest sites and foraging areas (2015-2019; n = 120), but during the 2022 HPAIV outbreak, GPS-tagged gannets instigated long-distance movements beyond well-documented previous ranges and the first ever recorded visits of GPS-tagged adults to other gannet breeding colonies. Our findings suggest that the HPAIV outbreak triggered changes in space use patterns of exposed individuals that amplified the epidemiological connectivity among colonies and may generate super-spreader events that accelerate disease transmission across the metapopulation. Such self-propagating transmission from and towards high density animal aggregations may explain the unexpectedly rapid pan-European spread of HPAIV in the gannet.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on behavioral and ecological consequences of HPAIV outbreaks in seabirds without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: Synchrony of Bird Migration with Global Dispersal of Avian Influenza Reveals Exposed Bird Orders.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A H5, particularly clade 2.3.4.4, has caused worldwide outbreaks in domestic poultry, occasional spillover to humans, and increasing deaths of diverse species of wild birds since 2014. Wild bird migration is currently acknowledged as an important ecological process contributing to the global dispersal of HPAIV H5. However, this mechanism has not been quantified using bird movement data from different species, and the timing and location of exposure of different species is unclear. We sought to explore these questions through phylodynamic analyses based on empirical data of bird movement tracking and virus genome sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1. First, we demonstrate that seasonal bird migration can explain salient features of the global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4. Second, we detect synchrony between the seasonality of bird annual cycle phases and virus lineage movements. We reveal the differing exposed bird orders at geographical origins and destinations of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage movements, including relatively under-discussed orders. Our study provides a phylodynamic framework that links the bird movement ecology and genomic epidemiology of avian influenza; it highlights the importance of integrating bird behavior and life history in avian influenza studies.

Title: An amplicon-based nanopore sequencing workflow for rapid tracking of avian influenza outbreaks, France, 2020-2022.
Abstract: During the recent avian influenza epizootics that occurred in France in 2020/21 and 2021/22, the virus was so contagiousness that it was impossible to control its spread between farms. The preventive slaughter of millions of birds consequently was the only solution available. In an effort to better understand the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in a rapid and innovative manner, we established an amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow for the rapid genetic typing of circulating AIV strains. An amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow based on a set of PCR primers targeting primarily the hemagglutinin gene but also the entire influenza virus genome was developed. Thirty field samples from H5 HPAIV outbreaks in France, including environmental samples, were sequenced using the MinION MK1C. A real-time alignment of the sequences with MinKNOW software allowed the sequencing run to be stopped as soon as enough data were generated. The consensus sequences were then generated and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish links between the outbreaks. The whole sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was obtained for the 30 clinical samples of H5Nx HPAIV belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b. The consensus sequences comparison and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated links between some outbreaks. While several studies have shown the advantages of MinION for avian influenza virus sequencing, this workflow has been applied exclusively to clinical field samples, without any amplification step on cell cultures or embryonated eggs. As this type of testing pipeline requires only a short amount of time to link outbreaks or demonstrate a new introduction, it could be applied to the real-time management of viral epizootics.

Title: A polarized cell system amenable to subcellular resolution imaging of influenza virus infection.
Abstract: The life cycle of influenza A viruses (IAV), and notably intracellular trafficking of the viral genome, depends on multiple interactions with the cellular cytoskeleton and endomembrane system. A limitation of the conventional cellular models used for mechanistic study and subcellular imaging of IAV infection is that they are cultured in two dimensions (2D) under non-polarizing conditions, and therefore they do not recapitulate the intracellular organization of the polarized respiratory epithelial cells naturally targeted by IAVs. To overcome this limitation, we developed an IAV-infection assay in a 3D cell culture system which allows imaging along the baso-lateral axis of polarized cells, with subcellular resolution. Here we describe a protocol to grow polarized monolayers of Caco2-TC7 cells on static Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads, infect them with IAV, and subsequently perform immunostaining and confocal imaging, or electron microscopy, on polarized IAV-infected cells. This method can be extended to other pathogens that infect human polarized epithelial cells.

Reason: The paper focuses on developing a polarized cell culture system for imaging influenza virus infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Targeted genomic sequencing of avian influenza viruses in wetland sediment from wild bird habitats.
Abstract: Diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in wild birds, including highly pathogenic strains that infect poultry and humans. Consequently, surveillance of IAVs in wild birds is a cornerstone of agricultural biosecurity and pandemic preparedness. Surveillance is traditionally done by testing wild birds directly, but obtaining these specimens is labor intensive, detection rates can be low, and sampling is often biased toward certain avian species. As a result, local incursions of dangerous IAVs are rarely detected before outbreaks begin. Testing environmental specimens from wild bird habitats has been proposed as an alternative surveillance strategy. These specimens are thought to contain diverse IAVs deposited by a broad range of avian hosts, including species that are not typically sampled by surveillance programs. To enable this surveillance strategy, we developed a targeted genomic sequencing method for characterizing IAVs in these challenging environmental specimens. It combines custom hybridization probes, unique molecular index-based library construction, and purpose-built bioinformatic tools, allowing IAV genomic material to be enriched and analyzed with single-fragment resolution. We demonstrated our method on 90 sediment specimens from wetlands around Vancouver, Canada. We recovered 2,312 IAV genome fragments originating from all eight IAV genome segments. Eleven hemagglutinin subtypes and nine neuraminidase subtypes were detected, including H5, the current global surveillance priority. Our results demonstrate that targeted genomic sequencing of environmental specimens from wild bird habitats could become a valuable complement to avian influenza surveillance programs.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we developed genome sequencing tools for characterizing avian influenza viruses in sediment from wild bird habitats. These tools enable an environment-based approach to avian influenza surveillance. This could improve early detection of dangerous strains in local wild birds, allowing poultry producers to better protect their flocks and prevent human exposures to potential pandemic threats. Furthermore, we purposefully developed these methods to contend with viral genomic material that is diluted, fragmented, incomplete, and derived from multiple strains and hosts. These challenges are common to many environmental specimens, making these methods broadly applicable for genomic pathogen surveillance in diverse contexts.

Reason: The study develops a genomic sequencing method for avian influenza viruses in environmental samples but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Chloride Intracellular Channel Protein 1 (CLIC1) Is a Critical Host Cellular Factor for Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: (1) Background: Influenza A Virus (IAV) uses host cellular proteins during replication in host cells. IAV infection causes elevated expression of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1) in lung epithelial cells, but the importance of this protein in IAV replication is unknown. (2) In this study, we determined the role of CLIC1 in IAV replication by investigating the effects of CLIC1 knockdown (KD) on IAV viral protein translation, genomic RNA transcription, and host cellular proteome dysregulation. (3) Results: CLIC1 KD in A549 human lung epithelial cells resulted in a significant decrease in progeny supernatant IAV, but virus protein expression was unaffected. However, a significantly larger number of viral RNAs accumulated in CLIC1 KD cells. Treatment with a CLIC1 inhibitor also caused a significant reduction in IAV replication, suggesting that CLIC1 is an important host factor in IAV replication. SomaScan<sup>®</sup>, which measures 1322 proteins, identified IAV-induced dysregulated proteins in wild-type cells and in CLIC1 KD cells. The expression of 116 and 149 proteins was significantly altered in wild-type and in CLIC1 KD cells, respectively. A large number of the dysregulated proteins in CLIC1 KD cells were associated with cellular transcription and predicted to be inhibited during IAV replication. (4) Conclusions: This study suggests that CLIC1 is involved in later stages of IAV replication. Further investigation should clarify mechanism(s) for the development of anti-IAV drugs targeting CLIC1 protein.

Title: Zoonosis and zooanthroponosis of emerging respiratory viruses.
Abstract: Lung infections in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) are triggered by a variety of respiratory viruses. All human pandemics have been caused by the members of two major virus families, namely <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i> (influenza A viruses (IAVs); subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) and <i>Coronaviridae</i> (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). These viruses acquired some adaptive changes in a known intermediate host including domestic birds (IAVs) or unknown intermediate host (SARS-CoV-2) following transmission from their natural reservoirs (e.g. migratory birds or bats, respectively). Verily, these acquired adaptive substitutions facilitated crossing species barriers by these viruses to infect humans in a phenomenon that is known as zoonosis. Besides, these adaptive substitutions aided the variant strain to transmit horizontally to other contact non-human animal species including pets and wild animals (zooanthroponosis). Herein we discuss the main zoonotic and reverse-zoonosis events that occurred during the last two pandemics of influenza A/H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. We also highlight the impact of interspecies transmission of these pandemic viruses on virus evolution and possible prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Based on information available and presented in this review article, it is important to close monitoring viral zoonosis and viral reverse zoonosis of pandemic strains within a One-Health and One-World approach to mitigate their unforeseen risks, such as virus evolution and resistance to limited prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.

Title: Production of antiviral "OP7 chimera" defective interfering particles free of infectious virus.
Abstract: Defective interfering particles (DIPs) of influenza A virus (IAV) are suggested for use as broad-spectrum antivirals. We discovered a new type of IAV DIP named "OP7" that carries point mutations in its genome segment (Seg) 7 instead of a deletion as in conventional DIPs (cDIPs). Recently, using genetic engineering tools, we generated "OP7 chimera DIPs" that carry point mutations in Seg 7 plus a deletion in Seg 1. Together with cDIPs, OP7 chimera DIPs were produced in shake flasks in the absence of infectious standard virus (STV), rendering UV inactivation unnecessary. However, only part of the virions harvested were OP7 chimera DIPs (78.7%) and total virus titers were relatively low. Here, we describe the establishment of an OP7 chimera DIP production process applicable for large-scale production. To increase total virus titers, we reduced temperature from 37 to 32 °C during virus replication. Production of almost pure OP7 chimera DIP preparations (99.7%) was achieved with a high titer of 3.24 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 µL). This corresponded to an 11-fold increase relative to the initial process. Next, this process was transferred to a stirred tank bioreactor resulting in comparable yields. Moreover, DIP harvests purified and concentrated by steric exclusion chromatography displayed an increased interfering efficacy in vitro. Finally, a perfusion process with perfusion rate control was established, resulting in a 79-fold increase in total virus yields compared to the original batch process in shake flasks. Again, a very high purity of OP7 chimera DIPs was obtained. This process could thus be an excellent starting point for good manufacturing practice production of DIPs for use as antivirals. KEY POINTS: • Scalable cell culture-based process for highly effective antiviral OP7 chimera DIPs • Production of almost pure OP7 chimera DIPs in the absence of infectious virus • Perfusion mode production and purification train results in very high titers.

Title: Unveiling the role of host kinases at different steps of influenza A virus life cycle.
Abstract: Influenza viruses remain a major public health concern causing contagious respiratory illnesses that result in around 290,000-650,000 global deaths every year. Their ability to constantly evolve through antigenic shifts and drifts leads to the emergence of newer strains and resistance to existing drugs and vaccines. To combat this, there is a critical need for novel antiviral drugs through the introduction of host-targeted therapeutics. Influenza viruses encode only 14 gene products that get extensively modified through phosphorylation by a diverse array of host kinases. Reversible phosphorylation at serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues dynamically regulates the structure, function, and subcellular localization of viral proteins at different stages of their life cycle. In addition, kinases influence a plethora of signaling pathways that also regulate virus propagation by modulating the host cell environment thus establishing a critical virus-host relationship that is indispensable for executing successful infection. This dependence on host kinases opens up exciting possibilities for developing kinase inhibitors as next-generation anti-influenza therapy. To fully capitalize on this potential, extensive mapping of the influenza virus-host kinase interaction network is essential. The key focus of this review is to outline the molecular mechanisms by which host kinases regulate different steps of the influenza A virus life cycle, starting from attachment-entry to assembly-budding. By assessing the contributions of different host kinases and their specific phosphorylation events during the virus life cycle, we aim to develop a holistic overview of the virus-host kinase interaction network that may shed light on potential targets for novel antiviral interventions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on host kinases regulating influenza A virus life cycle steps, focusing on host factors rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Immunosuppressants exert antiviral effects against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus via inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, mRNA splicing, and protein stability.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a threat to patients receiving immunosuppressive medications since they are more susceptible to infection with severe symptoms, and even death. Understanding the direct effects of immunosuppressants on IAV infection is critical for optimizing immunosuppression in these patients who are infected or at risk of influenza virus infection. We profiled the effects of 10 immunosuppressants, explored the antiviral mechanisms of immunosuppressants, and demonstrated the combined effects of immunosuppressants with the antiviral drug oseltamivir in IAV-infected cell models. We found that mycophenolic acid (MPA) strongly inhibits viral RNA replication via depleting cellular guanosine pool. Treatment with 6-Thioguanine (6-TG) promoted viral protein degradation through a proteasomal pathway. Filgotinib blocked mRNA splicing of matrix protein 2, resulting in decreased viral particle assembly. Furthermore, combined treatment with immunosuppressants and oseltamivir inhibits IAV viral particle production in an additive or synergic manner. Our results suggest that MPA, 6-TG, and filgotinib could be the preferential choices for patients who must take immunosuppressants but are at risk of influenza virus infection.

Title: Role of Influenza A virus protein NS1 in regulating host nuclear body ND10 complex formation and its involvement in establishment of viral pathogenesis.
Abstract: Influenza viral infection is a seasonal infection which causes widespread acute respiratory issues among humans globally. This virus changes its surface receptor composition to escape the recognition process by the host's immune cells. Therefore, the present study focussed to identify some other important viral proteins which have a significant role in establishment of infection and having apparent conserved structural composition. This could facilitate the permanent vaccine development process or help in designing a drug against IAV (influenza A virus) infection which will eliminate the seasonal flu shot vaccination process. The NS1 (Non-structural protein 1) protein of IAV maintains a conserved structural motif. Earlier studies have shown its significant role in infection establishment. However, the mechanism by which viruses escape the host's ND10 antiviral action remains elusive. The present study clearly showed that IAV infection and NS1 transfection in A549 cells degraded the main component of the ND10 anti-viral complex, PML and therefore, inhibited the formation of Daxx-sp100-p53-PML complex (ND10) at the mid phase of infection/transfection. PML degradation activated the stress axis which increased cellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, IAV/NS1 increased cellular stress and p53 accumulation at the late phase of infection. These collectively activated apoptotic pathway in the host cells. Along with the inactivation of several interferon proteins, IAV was found to decrease p-IKKε. A549 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-NS1 showed a similar effect in the interferon axis and IKKε. Moreover, NS1 induced the disintegration of the host's ND10 complex through the changes in the SUMOylation pattern of the PML nuclear body. These findings suggest the possible mechanism of how NS1 helps IAV to establish infection in the host cells. However, it demands further detailed study before targeting NS1 to develop permanent vaccines or novel drugs against IAV in future.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of the NS1 protein in viral pathogenesis and host interactions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Transmission Bottleneck Size Estimation from De Novo Viral Genetic Variation.
Abstract: Sequencing of viral infections has become increasingly common over the last decade. Deep sequencing data in particular have proven useful in characterizing the roles that genetic drift and natural selection play in shaping within-host viral populations. They have also been used to estimate transmission bottleneck sizes from identified donor-recipient pairs. These bottleneck sizes quantify the number of viral particles that establish genetic lineages in the recipient host and are important to estimate due to their impact on viral evolution. Current approaches for estimating bottleneck sizes exclusively consider the subset of viral sites that are observed as polymorphic in the donor individual. However, these approaches have the potential to substantially underestimate true transmission bottleneck sizes. Here, we present a new statistical approach for instead estimating bottleneck sizes using patterns of viral genetic variation that arise de novo within a recipient individual. Specifically, our approach makes use of the number of clonal viral variants observed in a transmission pair, defined as the number of viral sites that are monomorphic in both the donor and the recipient but carry different alleles. We first test our approach on a simulated dataset and then apply it to both influenza A virus sequence data and SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from identified transmission pairs. Our results confirm the existence of extremely tight transmission bottlenecks for these 2 respiratory viruses.

Reason: The paper presents a statistical method to estimate transmission bottleneck sizes from viral genetic variation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The avian influenza A virus receptor SA-α2,3-Gal is expressed in the porcine nasal mucosa sustaining the pig as a mixing vessel for new influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) originate from wild birds but have on several occasions jumped host barriers and are now also circulating in humans and mammals. The IAV host receptors (glycans with galactose linked to a sialic acid (SA) in an α2,3 or α2,6 linkage) are crucial host factors restricting inter-species transmission. In general, avian-origin IAVs show a preference for SA-α2,3 (avian receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from humans and pigs prefer SA-α2,6 (human receptor). N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the two major SAs. Neu5Ac is expressed in all species, whereas Neu5Gc is only expressed in a limited number of domestic species such as pigs and horses, but not in humans. Despite that previous studies have shown that the IAV host receptor distribution appears to be similar in pigs and humans, none of these studies have investigated the expression of Neu5Gc-α2,6 in situ in porcine tissues. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the distribution of IAV host receptors expressed in the porcine respiratory tract and relate the expression to the viral tropism of diverse host-adapted IAVs. The IAV receptor (SA-α2,3 and SA-α2,6) distribution and the presence of specifically Neu5Gc-α2,6 in the porcine nasal, tracheal, and lung tissues was investigated by lectin histochemistry. Furthermore, IAV immunohistochemistry was performed on tissues from pigs experimentally infected with IAVs, either adapted to pigs or humans, to investigate the significance of the IAV host receptors and the tropism of the diverse host-adapted IAVs. We document for the first time the expression of the avian receptor on the surface of the porcine nasal mucosa and an equal expression of Neu5Ac-α2,6 and Neu5Gc-α2,6 on the surface of the tracheal epithelium and alveoli. In all IAV-infected pigs, we found a low amount of IAV-positive cells in the trachea despite a high expression of the human receptor. Cumulatively, these findings suggest that optimal IAV replication involves a complex interplay between the viruses and their host receptors and that there might be other less clearly defined host factors that determine the site of replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host receptor distribution and viral tropism but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: First Report of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza Subtype H9N2 in African Houbara Bustards (<i>Chlamydotis undulata undulata</i>) and Gamebirds in Morocco: Clinico-Pathological Findings, Molecular Characterization, and Associated Coinfections.
Abstract: We report in this paper the first detection of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtype H9N2 in houbara bustards and in gamebirds in Morocco. Starting in 2019, an increase in mortality rates related to respiratory distress was recorded in these species. Necropsy of the specimens revealed fibrinous sinusitis and tracheitis with intra-bronchial fibrin casts, which are consistent with H9N2 infection in chickens; therefore, implication of the virus in these outbreaks was strongly suspected. Consequently, between January 2020 and June 2023, birds with respiratory signs were necropsied for pathological lesions, tissue samples were examined by histopathology, and samples of trachea, lungs, and cecal tonsils were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR for the detection of H9N2 virus. In addition, the sequencing of isolates was performed and lastly differential diagnosis with other respiratory pathogens was carried out. During the study period, 93 samples were collected from suspected H9N2 outbreaks, of which 30 tested positive for H9N2 virus: 23 Houbara bustards, 4 partridges, 2 quails, and 1 pheasant. Moreover, sequencing of the HA gene of the virus showed 97.33% nucleotide identity with strains reported previously in broilers in Morocco in 2017 and in 2022. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the Moroccan partridge isolates in the same cluster as viruses isolated in Morocco between 2016 and 2022, Algeria (2017), Burkina Faso (2017), Nigeria (2019), and Togo (2020). Additionally, 10 house sparrows from the premises of these birds were examined for the presence of H9N2 virus, revealing a 30% positivity rate. In conclusion, LPAIV H9N2 is circulating in houbara bustards and gamebirds in Morocco, and house sparrows might be a possible source of the infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of LPAI H9N2 in the African species of houbara bustards worldwide and in gamebirds in Morocco.

Title: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza H9N2 Viruses in Morocco: Antigenic and Molecular Evolution from 2021 to 2023.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses pose significant threats to both the poultry industry and public health worldwide. Among them, the H9N2 subtype has gained substantial attention due to its high prevalence, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa; its ability to reassort with other influenza viruses; and its potential to infect humans. This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic and molecular analysis of H9N2 avian influenza viruses circulating in Morocco from 2021 to 2023. Through an active epidemiological survey, a total of 1140 samples (trachea and lungs) and oropharyngeal swabs pooled into 283 pools, collected from 205 farms located in 7 regions of Morocco known for having a high density of poultry farms, were analyzed. Various poultry farms were investigated (159 broiler farms, 24 layer farms, 10 breeder farms, and 12 turkey breeder farms). A total of 21 AI H9N2 strains were isolated, and in order to understand the molecular evolution of the H9N2 avian influenza virus, their genetic sequences were determined using the Sanger sequencing technique. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a dataset comprising global H9N2 sequences to determine the genetic relatedness and evolutionary dynamics of the Moroccan strains. The results revealed the continued circulation and diversification of H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Morocco during the study period. Real-time RT-PCR showed a positivity rate of 35.6% (73/205), with cycle threshold values ranging from 19.2 to 34.9. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Moroccan strains belonged to a G1-like lineage and regrouped into two distinct clusters. Our newly detected isolates aggregated distinctly from the genotypes previously isolated in Morocco, North and West Africa, and the Middle East. This indicats the potential of virus evolution resulting from both national circulation and cross-border transmission. A high genetic diversity at both nucleotide and amino-acid levels was observed among all the strains isolated in this study, as compared to H9N2 strains isolated in Morocco since 2016, which suggests the co-circulation of genetically diverse H9N2 variants. Newly discovered mutations were detected in hemagglutinin positions 226, 227, and 193 (H3 numbering), which highlights the genetic evolution of the H9N2 AIVs. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of H9N2 in the region and provide valuable insights for the development of effective prevention and control strategies against this emerging avian influenza subtype.

Title: Active surveillance for influenza virus and coronavirus infection in Antarctic birds and mammals in environmental fecal samples, South Shetland Islands.
Abstract: Numerous Antarctic species are recognized as reservoirs for various pathogens, and their migratory behavior allows them to reach the Brazilian coast, potentially contributing to the emergence and circulation of new infectious diseases. To address the potential zoonotic risks, we conducted surveillance of influenza A virus (IAV) and coronaviruses (CoVs) in the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically focusing on different bird and mammal species in the region. During the summer of 2021/2022, as part of the Brazilian Antarctic Expedition, we collected and examined a total of 315 fecal samples to target these respiratory viruses. Although we did not detect the viruses of interest during this particular expedition, previous research conducted by our team has shown the presence of the H11N2 subtype of influenza A virus in penguin fecal samples from the same region. Given the continuous emergence of new viral strains worldwide, it is crucial to maintain active surveillance in the area, contributing to strengthening integrated One Health surveillance efforts.

Title: Polyphenol rich sugarcane extract (PRSE) has potential antiviral activity against influenza A virus in vitro.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the major global public health concerns but the emerging resistance of IAV to currently available antivirals requires the need to identify potential alternatives. Polyphenol rich sugarcane extract (PRSE) is an extract prepared from the sugarcane plant Saccharum Officinarum. Herein we aimed to determine if PRSE had antiviral activity against IAV. We showed that treatment of IAV-infected cells with PRSE results in a dose-dependent inhibition of virus infection at concentrations that were non-cytotoxic. PRSE treatment limited the early stages of infection, reducing viral genome replication, mRNA transcription and viral protein expression. PRSE did not affect the ability of IAV to bind sialic acid or change the morphology of viral particles. Additionally, PRSE treatment attenuated the replication of multiple IAV strains of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtype. In conclusion, we show that PRSE displays antiviral activity against a broad range of IAV strains, in vitro.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral activity of a plant extract against influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection and phylogenetic analysis of contemporary H14N2 Avian influenza A virus in domestic ducks in Southeast Asia (Cambodia).
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) in Asia is a complex system with numerous subtypes and a highly porous wild birds-poultry interface. Certain AIV subtypes, such as H14, are underrepresented in current surveillance efforts, leaving gaps in our understanding of their ecology and evolution. The detection of rare subtype H14 in domestic ducks in Southeast Asia comprises a geographic region and domestic bird population previously unassociated with this subtype. These H14 viruses have a complex evolutionary history involving gene reassortment events. They share sequence similarity to AIVs endemic in Cambodian ducks, and Eurasian low pathogenicity and high pathogenicity H5Nx AIVs. The detection of these H14 viruses in Southeast Asian domestic poultry further advances our knowledge of the ecology and evolution of this subtype and reinforces the need for continued, longitudinal, active surveillance in domestic and wild birds. Additionally, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> risk assessment should encompass rare AIV subtypes, as they have the potential to establish in poultry systems.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection and phylogenetic analysis of H14N2 viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Optimizing environmental viral surveillance: bovine serum albumin increases RT-qPCR sensitivity for high pathogenicity avian influenza H5Nx virus detection from dust samples.
Abstract: With the circulation of high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses having intensified considerably in recent years, the European Union is considering the vaccination of farmed birds. A prerequisite for this vaccination is the implementation of drastic surveillance protocols. Environmental sampling is a relevant alternative to animal sampling. However, environmental samples often contain inhibitory compounds in large enough quantities to inhibit RT-qPCR reactions. As bovine serum albumin is a molecule used in many fields to overcome this inhibitory effect, we tested its use on dust samples from poultry farms in areas heavily affected by HPAIV epizootics. Our results show that its use significantly increases the sensitivity of the method.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on improving RT-qPCR sensitivity for virus detection in environmental samples and does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Defining the minimal components of the influenza A virus replication machinery via an in vitro reconstitution system.
Abstract: During influenza A virus infection, the viral RNA polymerase transcribes the viral negative-sense segmented RNA genome and replicates it in a two-step process via complementary RNA within viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. While numerous viral and host factors involved in vRNP functions have been identified, dissecting the roles of individual factors remains challenging due to the complex cellular environment in which vRNP activity has been studied. To overcome this challenge, we reconstituted viral transcription and a full cycle of replication in a test tube using vRNPs isolated from virions and recombinant factors essential for these processes. This novel system uncovers the minimal components required for influenza virus replication and also reveals new roles of regulatory factors in viral replication. Moreover, it sheds light on the molecular interplay underlying the temporal regulation of viral transcription and replication. Our highly robust in vitro system enables systematic functional analysis of factors modulating influenza virus vRNP activity and paves the way for imaging key steps of viral transcription and replication.

Title: Characterization of non-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that target the M1 and NP of influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Currently, many groups are focusing on isolating both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to the mutation-prone hemagglutinin as a tool to treat or prevent influenza virus infection. Less is known about the level of protection induced by non-neutralizing antibodies that target conserved internal influenza virus proteins. Such non-neutralizing antibodies could provide an alternative pathway to induce broad cross-reactive protection against multiple influenza virus serotypes and subtypes by partially overcoming influenza virus escape mediated by antigenic drift and shift. Accordingly, more information about the level of protection and potential mechanism(s) of action of non-neutralizing antibodies targeting internal influenza virus proteins could be useful for the design of broadly protective and universal influenza virus vaccines.

Title: Evolution and international transmission of H3N2 canine influenza A viruses from Korea during 2014-2017.
Abstract: Avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza A viruses (CIVs) have become enzootic in China and Korea and have sporadically transmitted to North America, causing multiple epidemics. We isolated six CIVs in Korea from CIV-infected patients during 2014-2017 and conducted whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Results revealed that CIVs have circulated and evolved in Korea since the early 2000s and then diversified into a new clade, probably contributing to multiple epidemics in China, the USA, and Canada. Our findings bridge an evolutionary gap for understanding the global transmission of CIVs, emphasizing the significance of continuous monitoring of CIVs.

Title: Structural Investigations of Interactions between the Influenza a Virus NS1 and Host Cellular Proteins.
Abstract: The Influenza A virus is a continuous threat to public health that causes yearly epidemics with the ever-present threat of the virus becoming the next pandemic. Due to increasing levels of resistance, several of our previously used antivirals have been rendered useless. There is a strong need for new antivirals that are less likely to be susceptible to mutations. One strategy to achieve this goal is structure-based drug development. By understanding the minute details of protein structure, we can develop antivirals that target the most conserved, crucial regions to yield the highest chances of long-lasting success. One promising IAV target is the virulence protein non-structural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 contributes to pathogenicity through interactions with numerous host proteins, and many of the resulting complexes have been shown to be crucial for virulence. In this review, we cover the NS1-host protein complexes that have been structurally characterized to date. By bringing these structures together in one place, we aim to highlight the strength of this field for drug discovery along with the gaps that remain to be filled.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a structural review of NS1-host protein interactions without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Existing Evidence for Influenza B Virus Adaptations to Drive Replication in Humans as the Primary Host.
Abstract: Influenza B virus (IBV) is one of the two major types of influenza viruses that circulate each year. Unlike influenza A viruses, IBV does not harbor pandemic potential due to its lack of historical circulation in non-human hosts. Many studies and reviews have highlighted important factors for host determination of influenza A viruses. However, much less is known about the factors driving IBV replication in humans. We hypothesize that similar factors influence the host restriction of IBV. Here, we compile and review the current understanding of host factors crucial for the various stages of the IBV viral replication cycle. While we discovered the research in this area of IBV is limited, we review known host factors that may indicate possible host restriction of IBV to humans. These factors include the IBV hemagglutinin (HA) protein, host nuclear factors, and viral immune evasion proteins. Our review frames the current understanding of IBV adaptations to replication in humans. However, this review is limited by the amount of research previously completed on IBV host determinants and would benefit from additional future research in this area.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing host factors influencing IBV replication without direct experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Global distribution, receptor binding, and cross-species transmission of H6 influenza viruses: risks and implications for humans.
Abstract: The H6 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) is a pervasive subtype that is ubiquitously found in both wild bird and poultry populations across the globe. Recent investigations have unveiled its capacity to infect mammals, thereby expanding its host range beyond that of other subtypes and potentially facilitating its global transmission. This heightened breadth also endows H6 AIVs with the potential to serve as a genetic reservoir for the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains through genetic reassortment and adaptive mutations. Furthermore, alterations in key amino acid loci within the H6 AIV genome foster the evolution of viral infection mechanisms, which may enable the virus to surmount interspecies barriers and infect mammals, including humans, thus posing a potential threat to human well-being. In this review, we summarize the origins, dissemination patterns, geographical distribution, cross-species transmission dynamics, and genetic attributes of H6 influenza viruses. This study holds implications for the timely detection and surveillance of H6 AIVs.

Title: The feather epithelium contributes to the dissemination and ecology of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in ducks.
Abstract: Immature feathers are known replication sites for high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) in poultry. However, it is unclear whether feathers play an active role in viral transmission. This study aims to investigate the contribution of the feather epithelium to the dissemination of clade 2.3.4.4b goose/Guangdong/1996 lineage H5 HPAIVs in the environment, based on natural and experimental infections of domestic mule and Muscovy ducks. During the 2016-2022 outbreaks, H5 HPAIVs exhibited persistent and marked feather epitheliotropism in naturally infected commercial ducks. Infection of the feather epithelium resulted in epithelial necrosis and disruption, as well as the production and environmental shedding of infectious virions. Viral and feather antigens colocalized in dust samples obtained from poultry barns housing naturally infected birds. In summary, the feather epithelium contributes to viral replication, and it is a likely source of environmental infectious material. This underestimated excretion route could greatly impact the ecology of HPAIVs, facilitating airborne and preening-related infections within a flock, and promoting prolonged viral infectivity and long-distance viral transmission between poultry farms.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza during 2022.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a record total of 12,073 human influenza positive samples during 2022. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or embryonated hen's eggs for potential use in seasonal influenza virus vaccines. In 2022, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated over influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, accounting for 77% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically and genetically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the southern hemisphere in 2022. Of 3,372 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition against oseltamivir.

Title: Disruption of influenza virus packaging signals results in various misassembled genome complexes.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome consists of eight distinct viral RNAs (vRNAs) that are typically packaged into a single virion as an octameric complex. How this genome complex is assembled and incorporated into the virion is poorly understood, but previous research suggests a coordinative role for packaging signals present in all vRNAs. Here, we show that disruption of two packaging signals in a model H7N7 influenza A virus results in a mixture of virions with unusual vRNA content, including empty virions, virions with one to four vRNAs, and virions with octameric complexes composed of vRNA duplicates. Our results suggest that (i) the assembly of error-free octameric complexes proceeds through a series of defined vRNA sub-complexes and (ii) virions can bud without incorporating complete octameric complexes.

Title: Anti-influenza drug screening and inhibition of apigetrin on influenza A virus replication via TLR4 and autophagy pathways.
Abstract: Activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 plays important roles in the influenzaA virus (IAV) infection. To explore TLR4 inhibitors, 161 traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) were screened. Further, we screened out Ixeris sonchifolia Hance, and its active compound, Apigetrin (apigenin-7-O-glucoside). Antiviral activity of Apigetrin was determined by plaque assay. We also further investigated the influence of Apigetrin on immune signaling pathways including TLRs, MAPK, NF-κB and autophagy pathways. The in-vitro results showed that the extract and its several ingredients could significantly inhibit IAV replication. Apigetrin significantly improved IAV-induced oxidative stress, inhibited the IAV-induced cytokine storm by suppressing the excessive activation of TLR3/4/7, JNK/p38 MAPK and NF-κB. Apigetrin decreased autophagosome accumulation and promoted degradation of IAV protein. Interestingly, Apigetrin antiviral activity was reversed by using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the agonists of TLR4, JNK/p38, NF-κB and autophagy. Most important, the in-vitro effective concentration is higher than the reported plasma concentration. The in-vivo test showed that Apigetrin significantly increased the average survival time, reduced the lung edema and IAV replication. In conclusion, we have found that Ixeris sonchifolia Hance and its several ingredients can inhibit IAV infection, and the mechanisms of action of Apigetrin against IAV is by regulating TLR4 and autophagy signaling pathways.

Title: Sequencing methods for HA and NA genes of avian influenza viruses from wild bird feces using Oxford Nanopore sequencing.
Abstract: We developed a method to determine the sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from RNA extracted directly from wild bird fecal samples, using Nanopore Flongle. We determined the nucleotide sequences and subtypes of HA and NA in 16 and 15 samples respectively, using Flongle. The results of HA and NA subtyping determined by the conventional method were consistent with their subtypes determined by our method, thereby the applicability of this method in the identification of HA and NA subtypes. In addition, the homology between the HA fragments in this and the Sanger methods ranged from 98.5 % to 100 %. Compared with conventional PCR with the Sanger method, this method can easily determine HA and NA subtypes and sequences directly from the fecal samples. It is easier to implement and has lower running costs (USD100$) than other NGS-based methods, making it a useful tool for avian influenza surveillance in wild birds.

Title: Predominance of low pathogenic avian influenza virus H9N2 in the respiratory co-infections in broilers in Tunisia: a longitudinal field study, 2018-2020.
Abstract: Respiratory diseases are a health and economic concern for poultry production worldwide. Given global economic exchanges and migratory bird flyways, respiratory viruses are likely to emerge continuously in new territories. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the major pathogens involved in respiratory disease in Tunisian broiler poultry and their epidemiology. Between 2018 and 2020, broilers farms in northeastern Tunisia were monitored, and 39 clinically diseased flocks were sampled. Samples were screened for five viral and three bacterial respiratory pathogens using a panel of real-time PCR assays. The reemergence of H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in commercial poultry was reported, and the Northern and Western African GI lineage strain was typed. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) GI-23 lineage and the avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) subtype B also were detected for the first time in broilers in Tunisia. H9N2 LPAIV was the most detected pathogen in the flocks tested, but rarely alone, as 15 of the 16 H9N2 positive flocks were co-infected. Except for infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), all of the targeted pathogens were detected, and in 61% of the respiratory disease cases, a combination of pathogens was identified. The major combinations were H9N2 + aMPV (8/39) and H9N2 + IBV (6/39), showing the high contribution of H9N2 LPAIV to the multifactorial respiratory diseases. This field survey provided evidence of the emergence of new respiratory viruses and the complexity of respiratory disease in Tunisia. A comprehensive and continuous surveillance strategy therefore is needed to better control respiratory pathogens in Tunisia.

Title: Influenza: Searching for Pandemic Origins.
Abstract: From a farming family of 13 children in New Zealand, I graduated with a Master of Science degree in microbiology from the University of Otago (Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand). I established the first veterinary virology laboratory at Wallaceville Animal Research Station. I subsequently completed my PhD degree at Australian National University (Canberra, Australia) and a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan). While in New South Wales, Australia, a walk on a beach littered with dead mutton birds (shearwaters) with Dr. Graeme Laver led to the surveillance of influenza in seabirds on the Great Barrier Reef Islands and my lifelong search for the origin of pandemic influenza viruses. Subsequent studies established that (<i>a</i>) aquatic birds are a natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, (<i>b</i>) these viruses replicate primarily in cells lining the intestinal tract, (<i>c</i>) reassortment in nature can lead to novel pandemic influenza viruses, and (<i>d</i>) live bird markets are one place where transmission of influenza virus from animals to humans occurs.

Title: Ecological characterization of 175 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds in Mongolia, 2009-2013 and 2016-2018.
Abstract: Since 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia worldwide, infecting poultry, humans and wild birds. Subsequently, global interest in avian influenza (AI) surveillance increased. Mongolia presents an opportunity to study viruses in wild birds because the country has very low densities of domestic poultry and supports large concentrations of migratory water birds. We conducted AI surveillance in Mongolia over two time periods, 2009-2013 and 2016-2018, utilizing environmental fecal sampling. Fresh fecal samples were collected from water bird congregation sites. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of positive samples were identified through viral isolation or molecular assays, with pathogenicity determined by HA subtype or sequencing the HA cleavage site. A total of 10,222 samples were collected. Of these, 7,025 fecal samples were collected from 2009 to 2013, and 3,197 fecal samples were collected from 2016 to 2018. Testing revealed 175 (1.7%) positive samples for low-pathogenicity influenza A, including 118 samples from 2009 to 2013 (1.7%) and 57 samples from 2016 to 2018 (1.8%). HA and NA subtyping of all positives identified 11 subtypes of HA and nine subtypes of NA in 29 different combinations. Within periods, viruses were detected more frequently during the fall season than in the early summer. Mongolia's critical wild bird habitat is positioned as a crossroad of multiple migratory flyways. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using an affordable environmental fecal sampling approach for AI surveillance and contributes to understanding the prevalence and ecology of low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in this important location, where birds from multiple flyways mix.

Title: Genetic Diversity of Type A Influenza Viruses Found in Swine Herds in Northwestern Poland from 2017 to 2019: The One Health Perspective.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are still a cause of concern for public health and veterinary services worldwide. With (-) RNA-segmented genome architecture, influenza viruses are prone to reassortment and can generate a great variety of strains, some capable of crossing interspecies barriers. Seasonal IAV strains continuously spread from humans to pigs, leading to multiple reassortation events with strains endemic to swine. Due to its high adaptability to humans, a reassortant strain based on "human-like" genes could potentially be a carrier of avian origin segments responsible for high virulence, and hence become the next pandemic strain with unseen pathogenicity. The rapid evolution of sequencing methods has provided a fast and cost-efficient way to assess the genetic diversity of IAV. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses (swIAVs) collected from Polish farms. A total of 376 samples were collected from 11 farms. The infection was confirmed in 112 cases. The isolates were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS), resulting in 93 full genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis classified 59 isolates as genotype T (H1avN2g) and 34 isolates as genotype P (H1pdmN1pdm), all of which had an internal gene cassette (IGC) derived from the H1N1pdm09-like strain. These data are consistent with evolutionary trends in European swIAVs. The applied methodology proved to be useful in monitoring the genetic diversity of IAV at the human-animal interface.

Title: Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity of Influenza A Defective Interfering Particles against Respiratory Syncytial, Yellow Fever, and Zika Virus Replication In Vitro.
Abstract: New broadly acting and readily available antiviral agents are needed to combat existing and emerging viruses. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) of influenza A virus (IAV) are regarded as promising options for the prevention and treatment of IAV infections. Interestingly, IAV DIPs also inhibit unrelated viral infections by stimulating antiviral innate immunity. Here, we tested the ability of IAV DIPs to suppress respiratory syncytial, yellow fever and Zika virus infections in vitro. In human lung (A549) cells, IAV DIP co-infection inhibited the replication and spread of all three viruses. In contrast, we observed no antiviral activity in Vero cells, which are deficient in the production of interferon (IFN), demonstrating its importance for the antiviral effect. Further, in A549 cells, we observed an enhanced type-I and type-III IFN response upon co-infection that appears to explain the antiviral potential of IAV DIPs. Finally, a lack of antiviral activity in the presence of the Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib was detected. This revealed a dependency of the antiviral activity on the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Overall, this study supports the notion that IAV DIPs may be used as broad-spectrum antivirals to treat infections with a variety of IFN-sensitive viruses, particularly respiratory viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates antiviral activity of influenza A defective interfering particles on other viruses, focusing on innate immunity stimulation rather than direct genotype-phenotype links of influenza viruses.

Title: Detection of H5N1 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses in Four Raptors and Two Geese in Japan in the Fall of 2022.
Abstract: In the fall of 2022, high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were detected from raptors and geese in Japan, a month earlier than in past years, indicating a shift in detection patterns. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on H5N1 HPAIVs detected from six wild birds during the 2022/2023 season to determine their genetic origins. Our findings revealed that these HPAIVs belong to the G2 group within clade 2.3.4.4b, with all isolates classified into three subgroups: G2b, G2d, and G2c. The genetic background of the G2b virus (a peregrine falcon-derived strain) and G2d viruses (two raptors and two geese-derived strains) were the same as those detected in Japan in the 2021/2022 season. Since no HPAI cases were reported in Japan during the summer of 2022, it is probable that migratory birds reintroduced the G2b and G2d viruses. Conversely, the G2c virus (a raptor-derived strain) was first recognized in Japan in the fall of 2022. This strain might share a common ancestor with HPAIVs from Asia and West Siberia observed in the 2021/2022 season. The early migration of waterfowl to Japan in the fall of 2022 could have facilitated the early invasion of HPAIVs.

Title: Recurring Trans-Atlantic Incursion of Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 Viruses by Long Distance Migratory Birds from Northern Europe to Canada in 2022/2023.
Abstract: In December 2022 and January 2023, we isolated clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses from six American crows (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>) from Prince Edward Island and a red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) from Newfoundland, Canada. Using full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, these viruses were found to fall into two distinct phylogenetic clusters: one group containing H5N1 viruses that had been circulating in North and South America since late 2021, and the other one containing European H5N1 viruses reported in late 2022. The transatlantic re-introduction for the second time by pelagic/Icelandic bird migration via the same route used during the 2021 incursion of Eurasian origin H5N1 viruses into North America demonstrates that migratory birds continue to be the driving force for transcontinental dissemination of the virus. This new detection further demonstrates the continual long-term threat of H5N1 viruses for poultry and mammals and the subsequent impact on various wild bird populations wherever these viruses emerge. The continual emergence of clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses requires vigilant surveillance in wild birds, particularly in areas of the Americas, which lie within the migratory corridors for long-distance migratory birds originating from Europe and Asia. Although H5Nx viruses have been detected at higher rates in North America since 2021, a bidirectional flow of H5Nx genes of American origin viruses to Europe has never been reported. In the future, coordinated and systematic surveillance programs for HPAI viruses need to be launched between European and North American agencies.

Title: The re-emergence of influenza following the COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria, Australia, 2021 to 2022.
Abstract: BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, limited global circulation of influenza viruses. In Australia, travel bans for non-residents and quarantine requirements for returned travellers were eased in November 2021, providing pathways for influenza viruses to be re-introduced.AimWe aimed to describe the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the re-emergence of influenza in Victoria, Australia to inform public health interventions.MethodsFrom 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2022, we conducted an epidemiological study analysing case notification data from the Victorian Department of Health to describe case demographics, interviewed the first 200 cases to establish probable routes of virus reintroduction and examined phylogenetic and antigenic data to understand virus diversity and susceptibility to current vaccines.ResultsOverall, 1,598 notifications and 1,064 positive specimens were analysed. The majority of cases (61.4%) occurred in the 15-34 years age group. Interviews revealed a higher incidence of international travel exposure during the first month of case detections, and high levels of transmission in university residential colleges were associated with return to campus. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype, with a single lineage predominating despite multiple importations.ConclusionEnhanced testing for respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a more complete picture of influenza virus transmission compared with previous seasons. Returned international travellers were important drivers of influenza reemergence, as were young adults, a group whose role has previously been under-recognised in the establishment of seasonal influenza epidemics. Targeting interventions, including vaccination, to these groups could reduce future influenza transmission.

Title: Phylodynamic approaches to studying avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses can cause severe disease in domestic and wild birds and are a pandemic threat. Phylodynamics is the study of how epidemiological, evolutionary, and immunological processes can interact to shape viral phylogenies. This review summarizes how phylodynamic methods have and could contribute to the study of avian influenza viruses. Specifically, we assess how phylodynamics can be used to examine viral spread within and between wild or domestic bird populations at various geographical scales, identify factors associated with virus dispersal, and determine the order and timing of virus lineage movement between geographic regions or poultry production systems. We discuss factors that can complicate the interpretation of phylodynamic results and identify how future methodological developments could contribute to improved control of the virus.

Title: Epidemiology-driven approaches to surveillance in HPAI-vaccinated poultry flocks aiming to demonstrate freedom from circulating HPAIV.
Abstract: Incursion pressure of high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) by secondary spread among poultry holdings and/or from infected migratory wild bird populations increases worldwide. Vaccination as an additional layer of protection of poultry holdings using appropriately matched vaccines aims at reducing clinical sequelae of HPAIV infection, disrupting HPAIV transmission, curtailing economic losses and animal welfare problems and cutting exposure risks of zoonotic HPAIV at the avian-human interface. Products derived from HPAIV-vaccinated poultry should not impose any risk of virus spread or exposure. Vaccination can be carried out with zero-tolerance for infection in vaccinated herds and must then be flanked by appropriate surveillance which requires tailoring at several levels: (i) Controlling appropriate vaccination coverage and adequate population immunity in individual flocks and across vaccinated populations; (ii) assessing HPAI-infection trends in unvaccinated and vaccinated parts of the poultry population to provide early detection of new/re-emerged HPAIV outbreaks; and (iii) proving absence of HPAIV circulation in vaccinated flocks ideally by real time-monitoring. Surveillance strategies, i.e. selecting targets, tools and random sample sizes, must be accommodated to the specific epidemiologic and socio-economic background. Methodological approaches and practical examples from three countries or territories applying AI vaccination under different circumstances are reviewed here.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses surveillance strategies and epidemiology of HPAI-vaccinated poultry flocks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of an identification method for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant based on the amplification-refractory mutation system.
Abstract: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 dominated the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high viral replication capacity and immune evasion, causing massive outbreaks of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Currently, variant identification is performed mainly by sequencing. However, the high requirements for equipment and operators as well as its high cost have limited its application in underdeveloped regions. To achieve an economical and rapid method of variant identification suitable for undeveloped areas, we applied an amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) based on PCR for the detection of novel coronavirus variants. The results showed that this method could be finished in 90 min and detect as few as 500 copies/mL and not react with SARS-Coronavirus, influenza <i>A H1N1(2009)</i>, and other cross-pathogens or be influenced by fresh human blood, α- interferon, and other interfering substances. In a set of double-blind trials, tests of 262 samples obtained from patients confirmed with Delta variant infection revealed that our method was able to accurately identify the Delta variant with high sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, the ARMS-PCR method applied in Delta variant identification is rapid, sensitive, specific, economical, and suitable for undeveloped areas. In our future study, ARMS-PCR will be further applied in the identification of other variants, such as Omicron.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a PCR-based method for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant but does not link viral genotype to phenotype beyond variant identification.

Title: Identification of Anti-Influenza A Compounds Inhibiting the Viral Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) Using a Type I Interferon-Driven Screening Strategy.
Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify efficient antiviral compounds to combat existing and emerging RNA virus infections, particularly those related to seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. While inhibitors of the influenza viral integral membrane proton channel protein (M2), neuraminidase (NA), and cap-dependent endonuclease are available, circulating influenza viruses acquire resistance over time. Thus, the need for the development of additional anti-influenza drugs with novel mechanisms of action exists. In the present study, a cell-based screening assay and a small molecule library were used to screen for activities that antagonized influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a highly conserved, multifunctional accessory protein that inhibits the type I interferon response against influenza. Two potential anti-influenza agents, compounds <b>157</b> and <b>164</b>, were identified with anti-NS1 activity, resulting in the reduction of A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza A virus replication and the restoration of IFN-β expression in human lung epithelial A549 cells. A 3D pharmacophore modeling study of the active compounds provided a glimpse of the structural motifs that may contribute to anti-influenza virus activity. This screening approach is amenable to a broader analysis of small molecule compounds to inhibit other viral targets.

Reason: The study focuses on identifying antiviral compounds targeting the NS1 protein and their effects on viral replication, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Glycolytic interference blocks influenza A virus propagation by impairing viral polymerase-driven synthesis of genomic vRNA.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV), like any other virus, provokes considerable modifications of its host cell's metabolism. This includes a substantial increase in the uptake as well as the metabolization of glucose. Although it is known for quite some time that suppression of glucose metabolism restricts virus replication, the exact molecular impact on the viral life cycle remained enigmatic so far. Using 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) we examined how well inhibition of glycolysis is tolerated by host cells and which step of the IAV life cycle is affected. We observed that effects induced by 2-DG are reversible and that cells can cope with relatively high concentrations of the inhibitor by compensating the loss of glycolytic activity by upregulating other metabolic pathways. Moreover, mass spectrometry data provided information on various metabolic modifications induced by either the virus or agents interfering with glycolysis. In the presence of 2-DG viral titers were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The supplementation of direct or indirect glycolysis metabolites led to a partial or almost complete reversion of the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on viral growth and demonstrated that indeed the inhibition of glycolysis and not of N-linked glycosylation was responsible for the observed phenotype. Importantly, we could show via conventional and strand-specific qPCR that the treatment with 2-DG led to a prolonged phase of viral mRNA synthesis while the accumulation of genomic vRNA was strongly reduced. At the same time, minigenome assays showed no signs of a general reduction of replicative capacity of the viral polymerase. Therefore, our data suggest that the significant reduction in IAV replication by glycolytic interference occurs mainly due to an impairment of the dynamic regulation of the viral polymerase which conveys the transition of the enzyme's function from transcription to replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the impact of glycolytic interference on influenza virus replication and polymerase activity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza transmission during COVID-19 measures downscaling in Greece, August 2022: evidence for the need of continuous integrated surveillance of respiratory viruses.
Abstract: After the near absence of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased activity of mainly influenza A(H3N2) was detected at the beginning of August 2022 in Greece on three islands. Of 33 cases with respiratory symptoms testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests, 24 were positive for influenza: 20 as A(H3N2) subtype and four as A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of selected samples from both subtypes was performed and they fell into clusters within subclades that included the 2022/23 vaccine strains. Our data suggest that influenza can be transmitted even in the presence of another highly infectious pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, with a similar transmission mode. We highlight the need for implementing changes in the current influenza surveillance and suggest a move from seasonal to continuous surveillance, especially in areas with a high number of tourists. Year-round surveillance would allow for a timelier start of vaccination campaigns and antiviral drugs procurement processes.

Title: The Aqueous Leaf Extract of the Medicinal Herb <i>Costus speciosus</i> Suppresses Influenza A H1N1 Viral Activity under In Vitro and In Vivo Conditions.
Abstract: This study investigated the antiviral activity of aqueous leaf extract of <i>Costus speciosus</i> (TB100) against influenza A. Pretreatment of TB100 in RAW264.7 cells enhanced antiviral activity in an assay using the green fluorescence-expressing influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus. The fifty percent effective concentration (EC50) and fifty percent cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were determined to be 15.19 ± 0.61 and 117.12 ± 18.31 µg/mL, respectively, for RAW264.7 cells. Based on fluorescent microscopy, green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression and viral copy number reduction confirmed that TB100 inhibited viral replication in murine RAW264.7 and human A549 and HEp2 cells. In vitro pretreatment with TB100 induced the phosphorylation of transcriptional activators TBK1, IRF3, STAT1, IKB-α, and p65 associated with interferon pathways, indicating the activation of antiviral defenses. The safety and protective efficacy of TB100 were assessed in BALB/c mice as an oral treatment and the results confirmed that it was safe and effective against influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Philippines/2/2008 (H3N2), and A/Chicken/Korea/116/2004 (H9N2). High-performance liquid chromatography of aqueous extracts led to the identification of cinnamic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids as potential chemicals for antiviral responses. Further confirmatory studies using these acids revealed that each of them confers significant antiviral effects against influenza when used as pretreatment and enhances the antiviral response in a time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that TB100 has the potential to be developed into an antiviral agent that is effective against seasonal influenza.

Title: Efficient and Informative Laboratory Testing for Rapid Confirmation of H5N1 (Clade 2.3.4.4) High-Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Outbreaks in the United Kingdom.
Abstract: During the early stages of the UK 2021-2022 H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) epizootic in commercial poultry, 12 infected premises (IPs) were confirmed by four real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT)-PCRs, which identified the viral subtype and pathotype. An assessment was undertaken to evaluate whether a large sample throughput would challenge laboratory capacity during an exceptionally large epizootic; hence, assay performance across our test portfolio was investigated. Statistical analysis of RRT-PCR swab testing supported it to be focused on a three-test approach, featuring the matrix (M)-gene, H5 HPAIV-specific (H5-HP) and N1 RRT-PCRs, which was successfully assessed at 29 subsequent commercial IPs. The absence of nucleotide mismatches in the primer/probe binding regions for the M-gene and limited mismatches for the H5-HP RRT-PCR underlined their high sensitivity. Although less sensitive, the N1 RRT-PCR remained effective at flock level. The analyses also guided successful surveillance testing of apparently healthy commercial ducks from at-risk premises, with pools of five oropharyngeal swabs tested by the H5-HP RRT-PCR to exclude evidence of infection. Serological testing at anseriform H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks, together with quantitative comparisons of oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding, provided epidemiological information concerning the chronology of initial H5N1 HPAIV incursion and onward spread within an IP.

Title: RNA Overwriting of Cellular mRNA by Cas13b-Directed RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Dysregulation of mRNA processing results in diseases such as cancer. Although RNA editing technologies attract attention as gene therapy for repairing aberrant mRNA, substantial sequence defects arising from mis-splicing cannot be corrected by existing techniques using adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) due to the limitation of adenosine-to-inosine point conversion. Here, we report an RNA editing technology called "RNA overwriting" that overwrites the sequence downstream of a designated site on the target RNA by utilizing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza A virus. To enable RNA overwriting within living cells, we developed a modified RdRp by introducing H357A and E361A mutations in the polymerase basic 2 of RdRp and fusing the C-terminus with catalytically inactive Cas13b (dCas13b). The modified RdRp knocked down 46% of the target mRNA and further overwrote 21% of the mRNA. RNA overwriting is a versatile editing technique that can perform various modifications, including addition, deletion, and mutation introduction, and thus allow for repair of the aberrant mRNA produced by dysregulation of mRNA processing, such as mis-splicing.

Title: Capsaicin functions as a selective degrader of STAT3 to enhance host resistance to viral infection.
Abstract: Although STAT3 has been reported as a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, the effects of pharmacologically inhibiting STAT3 on innate antiviral immunity are not well known. Capsaicin, approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral nerve pain, is an agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), with additional recognized potencies in anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. We investigated the effects of capsaicin on viral replication and innate antiviral immune response and discovered that capsaicin dose-dependently inhibited the replication of VSV, EMCV, and H1N1. In VSV-infected mice, pretreatment with capsaicin improved the survival rate and suppressed inflammatory responses accompanied by attenuated VSV replication in the liver, lung, and spleen. The inhibition of viral replication by capsaicin was independent of TRPV1 and occurred mainly at postviral entry steps. We further revealed that capsaicin directly bound to STAT3 protein and selectively promoted its lysosomal degradation. As a result, the negative regulation of STAT3 on the type I IFN response was attenuated, and host resistance to viral infection was enhanced. Our results suggest that capsaicin is a promising small-molecule drug candidate, and offer a feasible pharmacological strategy for strengthening host resistance to viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on capsaicin's effect on host STAT3 and antiviral immunity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Gain-of-function and origin of Covid19.
Abstract: In nature, wild viruses adapted for transmission circulate in many animal species (bats, birds, primates…). Contamination of other animals, including humans, may occur by crossing of the species barrier. Genetic manipulations have been carried out on wild viruses to favor the species jumping and to increase of viral virulence. The aim was to identify the critical genes for pathogenicity. This has been mainly performed on potentially epidemic pathogens, as Myxovirus influenzae of avian flu and coronaviruses of SARS and MERS epidemics. These dangerous experiments were subject to a moratorium in the United States (2014-2017). Three years after the emergence of Covid-19, the origin of du SARS-CoV2 remains a mystery. Covid19 appeared in Wuhan, officially in December 2019, but probably during the autumn 2019. The virus was identified in January 2020. It belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus). It was at once highly contagious. In addition, the primary isolates were genetically very homogeneous, differing only by two nucleotides without evidence for adaptive mutations. In addition, the Spike protein, a major virulence factor, has a furin site, not found in any other known sarbecovirus. Unlike the SARS and MERS epidemics, no intermediate host has been detected so far. Finally, no other outbreaks were reported at the beginning of the pandemic outside of Wuhan, contrary to what happened with the emergence of SARS (2002) and H7N9 avian influenza (2013). Today, there are two scenarios to explain the emergence of SARS-CoV2. Proponents of the natural origin argue that the bat virus might have directly infected humans, spreading silently at a low level in humans for years, without eliminating the existence of undetected intermediate hosts. This does not explain the origin in Wuhan, far away from the natural virus reservoirs. The furin site would have arisen spontaneously from other coronaviruses. The alternative scenario is that of a laboratory accident after gain-of-function manipulations from a SARS-like virus, or even the occurrence of a human contamination by a natural CoV virus grown on cells in Wuhan.

Title: Decoding the Fundamental Drivers of Phylodynamic Inference.
Abstract: Despite its increasing role in the understanding of infectious disease transmission at the applied and theoretical levels, phylodynamics lacks a well-defined notion of ideal data and optimal sampling. We introduce a method to visualize and quantify the relative impact of pathogen genome sequence and sampling times-two fundamental sources of data for phylodynamics under birth-death-sampling models-to understand how each drives phylodynamic inference. Applying our method to simulated data and real-world SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 Influenza data, we use this insight to elucidate fundamental trade-offs and guidelines for phylodynamic analyses to draw the most from sequence data. Phylodynamics promises to be a staple of future responses to infectious disease threats globally. Continuing research into the inherent requirements and trade-offs of phylodynamic data and inference will help ensure phylodynamic tools are wielded in ever more targeted and efficient ways.

Title: PARNAS: Objectively Selecting the Most Representative Taxa on a Phylogeny.
Abstract: The use of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled phylogenetic studies with hundreds of thousands of taxa. Such large-scale phylogenies have become a critical component in genomic epidemiology in pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. However, detailed phenotypic characterization of pathogens or generating a computationally tractable dataset for detailed phylogenetic analyses requires objective subsampling of taxa. To address this need, we propose parnas, an objective and flexible algorithm to sample and select taxa that best represent observed diversity by solving a generalized k-medoids problem on a phylogenetic tree. parnas solves this problem efficiently and exactly by novel optimizations and adapting algorithms from operations research. For more nuanced selections, taxa can be weighted with metadata or genetic sequence parameters, and the pool of potential representatives can be user-constrained. Motivated by influenza A virus genomic surveillance and vaccine design, parnas can be applied to identify representative taxa that optimally cover the diversity in a phylogeny within a specified distance radius. We demonstrated that parnas is more efficient and flexible than existing approaches. To demonstrate its utility, we applied parnas to 1) quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity over time, 2) select representative influenza A virus in swine genes derived from over 5 years of genomic surveillance data, and 3) identify gaps in H3N2 human influenza A virus vaccine coverage. We suggest that our method, through the objective selection of representatives in a phylogeny, provides criteria for quantifying genetic diversity that has application in the the rational design of multivalent vaccines and genomic epidemiology.

Title: Maximal interferon induction by influenza lacking NS1 is infrequent owing to requirements for replication and export.
Abstract: Influenza A virus exhibits high rates of replicative failure due to a variety of genetic defects. Most influenza virions cannot, when acting as individual particles, complete the entire viral life cycle. Nevertheless influenza is incredibly successful in the suppression of innate immune detection and the production of interferons, remaining undetected in >99% of cells in tissue-culture models of infection. Notably, the same variation that leads to replication failure can, by chance, inactivate the major innate immune antagonist in influenza A virus, NS1. What explains the observed rarity of interferon production in spite of the frequent loss of this, critical, antagonist? By studying how genetic and phenotypic variation in a viral population lacking NS1 correlates with interferon production, we have built a model of the "worst-case" failure from an improved understanding of the steps at which NS1 acts in the viral life cycle to prevent the triggering of an innate immune response. In doing so, we find that NS1 prevents the detection of de novo innate immune ligands, defective viral genomes, and viral export from the nucleus, although only generation of de novo ligands appears absolutely required for enhanced detection of virus in the absence of NS1. Due to this, the highest frequency of interferon production we observe (97% of infected cells) requires a high level of replication in the presence of defective viral genomes with NS1 bearing an inactivating mutation that does not impact its partner encoded on the same segment, NEP. This is incredibly unlikely to occur given the standard variation found within a viral population, and would generally require direct, artificial, intervention to achieve at an appreciable rate. Thus from our study, we procure at least a partial explanation for the seeming contradiction between high rates of replicative failure and the rarity of the interferon response to influenza infection.

Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Influenza A (H1N1) virus is an acute respiratory infectious disease that causes massive morbidity and mortality worldwide. As an essential trace element, selenium is widely applied in the treatment of various diseases because of its functions of enhancing immune response, antioxidant and antiviral mutation. In this study, we constructed the selenium-containing metal complex drug delivery system Ru(biim)(PhenSe)<sub>2</sub> (<b>RuSe</b>), and investigated the anti-influenza virus efficacy and the potential antiviral mechanism for <b>RuSe</b>. <b>Methods:</b> The inhibitory effect of <b>RuSe</b> on influenza-mediated apoptosis was examined by cell count assay, cell cycle assay, Annenxin-V assay, TUNEL-DAPI assay and reactive oxygen species level determination. Virulence assay, PCR and neuraminidase inhibition assay revealed the inhibition of <b>RuSe</b> on influenza virus. At the level of animal experiments, two animal models were used to clarify the role of <b>RuSe</b> through HE staining, immunohistochemical staining, cytokine determination, selenium metabolism determination and selenium protein expression level determination. <b>Results:</b> The results of this study confirm that <b>RuSe</b> enhances the expression levels of selenium proteins GPx1 and TrxR1 by regulating selenium metabolism, thereby inhibiting viral replication and assembly and regulating virus-mediated mitochondria-related apoptosis. On the other hand, animal experiments show that <b>RuSe</b> can reduce lung tissue inflammation and inhibit lung tissue cell apoptosis in mice, and improve the survival state of mice. In addition, <b>RuSe</b> significantly improves the low immune response of Se-deficient mice by regulating selenium metabolism, and effectively alleviated lung fibrosis and lung tissue apoptosis in Se-deficient mice. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study suggests that <b>RuSe</b> provides a promising new approach for the clinical treatment of influenza virus.

Title: Introduction of Multiple Novel High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (H5N1) Virus of Clade 2.3.4.4b into South Korea in 2022.
Abstract: Since October 2020, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have spread to many countries. Although these viruses evolved from Eurasian ancestors, reassortant with other LPAI viruses has generated various genotypes. Here, we identified three H5N1 HPAI viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b; these viruses were isolated from mandarin duck, common teal, and domestic breeder ducks in October 2022 during an avian influenza (AI) active surveillance program. Two of the H5N1 viruses (MD/WA496 and BD/H493) have been found sporadically in China, Russia, and Korea. It is presumed that two viruses with a similar gene constellation isolated in Russia, China, and Korea were introduced into the breeding area during the spring migration, and were introduced newly to Korea during the autumn migration. Due to international bird migration, the other virus (CT/WA537) is most similar (99.3-99.8%) to a virus detected in North Dakota, USA in April 2022. These results suggest that H5N1 viruses with at least two genotypes were introduced at the same time into Korea during the autumn of 2022, and that they originated from Eurasian breeding grounds and North America. Thus, multiple 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses were introduced into Korea during the autumn season of 2022.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports on the introduction and phylogenetics of H5N1 viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phospholipid analysis of two influenza A virus-infected cell lines differing in their viral replication kinetics.
Abstract: Fluctuations in phospholipid composition in infected cells during influenza A virus replication were analyzed using two different susceptible host cell lines: H292 cells, exhibiting a rapid cytopathic effect, and A549 cells, exhibiting a retarded cytopathic effect. Microarray analysis demonstrated that A549 cells recognized influenza A virus invasion, expression of pathogen recognition genes was affected, and antiviral genes were activated. On the other hand, H292 cells did not display such an antiviral state, and in these cells, rapid virus amplification and a rapid cytopathic effect were observed. Levels of ceramide, diacylglycerol, and lysolipids were higher in virus-infected cells than in the corresponding mock-infected cells at the later stages of infection. The accumulation of these lipids in IAV-infected cells occurred together with viral replication. The relationship between the characteristic features of ceramide, diacylglycerol, and lysolipid in the plasma membrane, where enveloped viruses are released, and their role in viral envelope formation are discussed. Our results indicate that viral replication disturbs cellular lipid metabolism, with consequences for viral replication kinetics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes phospholipid changes in infected cells and their relation to viral replication kinetics but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Defining basic rules for hardening influenza A virus liquid condensates.
Abstract: In biological systems, liquid and solid-like biomolecular condensates may contain the same molecules but their behaviour, including movement, elasticity, and viscosity, is different on account of distinct physicochemical properties. As such, it is known that phase transitions affect the function of biological condensates and that material properties can be tuned by several factors including temperature, concentration, and valency. It is, however, unclear if some factors are more efficient than others at regulating their behaviour. Viral infections are good systems to address this question as they form condensates <i>de novo</i> as part of their replication programmes. Here, we used influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, AKA viral inclusions, to provide a proof of concept that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or the temperature of the cell. Liquid IAV inclusions may be hardened by targeting vRNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) interactions via the known NP (nucleoprotein) oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> without affecting host proteome abundance nor solubility. This study is a starting point for understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates physical properties of viral condensates and their modulation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Efficacy of multivalent recombinant herpesvirus of turkey vaccines against high pathogenicity avian influenza, infectious bursal disease, and Newcastle disease viruses.
Abstract: Vaccines are an essential tool for the control of viral infections in domestic animals. We generated recombinant vector herpesvirus of turkeys (vHVT) vaccines expressing computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) H5 of avian influenza virus (AIV) alone (vHVT-AI) or in combination with virus protein 2 (VP2) of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (vHVT-IBD-AI) or fusion (F) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (vHVT-ND-AI). In vaccinated chickens, all three vHVT vaccines provided 90-100% clinical protection against three divergent clades of high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), and significantly decreased number of birds and oral viral shedding titers at 2 days post-challenge compared to shams. Four weeks after vaccination, most vaccinated birds had H5 hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers, which significantly increased post-challenge. The vHVT-IBD-AI and vHVT-ND-AI vaccines provided 100% clinical protection against IBDVs and NDV, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that multivalent HVT vector vaccines were efficacious for simultaneous control of HPAIV and other viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates vaccine efficacy against multiple viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: ARIH1 inhibits influenza A virus replication and facilitates RIG-I dependent immune signaling by interacting with SQSTM1/p62.
Abstract: Multiple host factors are involved in modulating type I interferon expression induced by viruses; however, the mechanism is not fully elucidated. Influenza A virus infection causes severe respiratory symptoms and triggers a series of signaling cascades and host innate immune responses, including interferon production. The co-IP/MS technology was used to screen several antiviral factors in the early stage. Among these factors, ariadne-1 homolog (ARIH1) caught our attention. Western blot assay was performed to detect the level of proteins and software ImageJ was used to analyze the band intensities. Polymerase activity assay was conducted to evaluate the polymerase activity of influenza A virus. Tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) assay was performed to measure influenza A virus titers, and quantitative RT-PCR assay was applied to test the mRNA level of IFN-β, ISG56, and CXCL10. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the target of ARIH1 in RIG-I signaling. Immunoprecipitation assay was performed to detect the interaction and the ubiquitination of the proteins. All data were analyzed by biostatistical methods and presented as means ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed student's t test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and a P value of less than 0.01 was considered highly significant (ns, P ≥ 0.05; *, P < 0.05; and **, P < 0.01). We found that ARIH1, a member of E3 ubiquitin ligases, enhanced cellular antiviral responses. Subsequent study showed that ARIH1 was up-regulated during influenza A virus infection. Further analysis showed that ARIH1 enhanced IFN-β and downstream gene expression by affecting the degradation of RIG-I through the SQSTM1/p62 signaling pathway. This newly revealed mechanism shows that cellular response increases of ARIH1 and promotes IFN-β expression to boost host survival during viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host factor ARIH1's role in immune signaling during influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Virological and Genetic Characterization of the Unusual Avian Influenza H14Nx Viruses in the Northern Asia.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are generally identified as a natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), where a high diversity of subtypes has been detected. Some AIV subtypes are considered to have relatively low prevalence in wild bird populations. Six-year AIV surveillance in Siberia revealed sporadic cases of the rarely identified H14-subtype AIV circulation. Complete genome sequencing of three H14 isolates were performed, and the analysis indicated interconnections between low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. We conducted hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization assays, estimated the susceptibility of isolates to neuraminidase inhibitors, and characterized receptor specificity. Our study revealed circulation of a new H14N9 subtype described for the first time. However, the low prevalence of the H14-subtype AIV population may be the reason for the underestimation of the diversity of H14-subtype AIVs. According to the available data, a region in which H14-subtype viruses were detected several times in 2007-2022 in the Eastern Hemisphere is Western Siberia, while the virus was also detected once in South Asia (Pakistan). Phylogenetic analysis of HA segment sequences revealed the circulation of two clades of H14-subtype viruses originated from initial 1980s Eurasian clade; the first was detected in Northern America and the second in Eurasia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports genetic characterization and phylogenetics of rare H14 subtype viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cross-reactivity influences changes in human influenza A virus and Epstein Barr virus specific CD8 memory T cell receptor alpha and beta repertoires between young and old.
Abstract: Older people have difficulty controlling infection with common viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), RNA virus which causes recurrent infections due to a high rate of genetic mutation, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), DNA virus which persists in B cells for life in the 95% of people that become acutely infected. We questioned whether changes in epitope-specific memory CD8 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires to these two common viruses could occur with increasing age and contribute to waning immunity. We compared CD8 memory TCR alpha and beta repertoires in two HLA-A2+ EBV- and IAV-immune donors, young (Y) and older (O) donors to three immunodominant epitopes known to be cross-reactive, IAV-M1<sub>58-66</sub> (IAV-M1), EBV-BMLF1<sub>280-288</sub> (EBV-BM), and EBV-BRLF1<sub>109-117</sub> (EBV-BR). We, therefore, also designed these studies to examine if TCR cross-reactivity could contribute to changes in repertoire with increasing age. TCR high throughput sequencing showed a significant difference in the pattern of TRBV usage between Y and O. However, there were many more differences in AV and AJ usage, between the age groups suggesting that changes in TCRα usage may play a greater role in evolution of the TCR repertoire emphasizing the importance of studying TRAV repertoires. With increasing age there was a preferential retention of TCR for all three epitopes with features in their complementarity-determining region (CDR3) that increased their ease of generation, and their cross-reactive potential. Young and older donors differed in the patterns of AV/AJ and BV/BJ pairings and usage of dominant CDR3 motifs specific to all three epitopes. Both young and older donors had cross-reactive responses between these 3 epitopes, which were unique and differed from the cognate responses having features that suggested they could interact with either ligand. There was an increased tendency for the classic IAV-M1 specific clone BV19-IRSS-JB2.7/AV27-CAGGGSQGNLIF-AJ42 to appear among the cross-reactive clones, suggesting that the dominance of this clone may relate to its cross-reactivity with EBV. These results suggest that although young and older donors retain classic TCR features for each epitope their repertoires are gradually changing with age, maintaining TCRs that are cross-reactive between these two common human viruses, one with recurrent infections and the other a persistent virus which frequently reactivates.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T cell receptor repertoire changes with age in response to viral epitopes, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Emerging triple-reassortant influenza C virus with household-associated infection during an influenza A(H3N2) outbreak, China, 2022.
Abstract: Recent research have shown that influenza C virus (ICV) has a possible higher clinical impact than previously thought. But knowledge about ICV is limited compared with influenza A and B viruses, due to poor systematic surveillance and inability to propagate. Herein, a case infected with triple reassortant ICV was identified during an influenza A(H3N2) outbreak, which was the first report of ICV infection in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this ICV was triple reassortant. Serological evidence revealed that the index case might be related to family-clustering infection. Therefore, it is essential to heighten surveillance for the prevalence and variation of ICV in China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports identification and phylogenetic analysis of a triple reassortant influenza C virus but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus coinfection dynamics are shaped by distinct virus-virus interactions within and between cells.
Abstract: When multiple viral populations propagate within the same host environment, they often shape each other's dynamics. These interactions can be positive or negative and can occur at multiple scales, from coinfection of a cell to co-circulation at a global population level. For influenza A viruses (IAVs), the delivery of multiple viral genomes to a cell substantially increases burst size. However, despite its relevance for IAV evolution through reassortment, the implications of this positive density dependence for coinfection between distinct IAVs has not been explored. Furthermore, the extent to which these interactions within the cell shape viral dynamics at the level of the host remains unclear. Here we show that, within cells, diverse coinfecting IAVs strongly augment the replication of a focal strain, irrespective of their homology to the focal strain. Coinfecting viruses with a low intrinsic reliance on multiple infection offer the greatest benefit. Nevertheless, virus-virus interactions at the level of the whole host are antagonistic. This antagonism is recapitulated in cell culture when the coinfecting virus is introduced several hours prior to the focal strain or under conditions conducive to multiple rounds of viral replication. Together, these data suggest that beneficial virus-virus interactions within cells are counterbalanced by competition for susceptible cells during viral propagation through a tissue. The integration of virus-virus interactions across scales is critical in defining the outcomes of viral coinfection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on virus-virus interactions and coinfection dynamics without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance and Phylogenetic Characterisation of Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Wild Waterfowl in Zambia in 2015, 2020, and 2021.
Abstract: In recent years, the southern African region has experienced repeated incursions of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), with wild migratory birds being implicated in the spread. To understand the profile of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in Zambia, we surveyed wild waterfowl for AIVs and phylogenetically characterised the isolates detected in 2015, 2020, and 2021. A total of 2,851 faecal samples of wild waterfowl were collected from Lochinvar National Park in the Southern Province of Zambia. During the study period, 85 (3.0%) low pathogenicity AIVs belonging to various subtypes were isolated, with H2N9, H8N4, and H10N8 being reported for the first time in avian species in Africa. The majority of the isolates were detected from glossy ibis (order <i>Pelecaniformes</i>) making it the first report of AIV from these birds in Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight gene segments of the 30 full genomes obtained in this study revealed that all the isolates belonged to the Eurasian lineage with their closest relatives being viruses isolated from wild and/or domestic birds in Bangladesh, Belgium, Egypt, Georgia, Mongolia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. Additionally, the Zambian viruses were grouped into distinct clusters based on the year of isolation. While no notifiable AIVs of the H5 or H7 subtypes were detected in wild birds in Zambia, viral internal protein genes of some viruses were closely related to H7 low pathogenicity AIVs. This study shows that periodically, a considerable diversity of AIV subtypes are introduced into the Zambian ecosystem by wild migratory waterfowl. The findings highlight the importance of continuous surveillance and monitoring of AIVs in wild waterfowl, including birds traditionally not considered to be major AIV reservoirs, for a better understanding of the eco-epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of AIVs in Africa.

Title: Blue-Winged Teals in Guatemala and Their Potential Role in the Ecology of H14 Subtype Influenza a Viruses.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are considered the natural hosts of 16 HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes of influenza A viruses (FLUAV) found in different combinations. H14 FLUAVs are rarely detected in nature. Since 2011, H14 FLUAVs have been consistently detected in Guatemala, leading to the largest collection of this subtype from a single country. All H14 FLUAVs in Guatemala were detected from blue-winged teal samples. In this report, 17 new full-length H14 FLUAV genome sequences detected from 2014 until 2019 were analyzed and compared to all published H14 sequences, including Guatemala, North America, and Eurasia. The H14 FLUAVs identified in Guatemala were mostly associated with the N3 subtype (<i>n</i> = 25), whereas the rest were paired with either N4 (<i>n</i> = 7), N5 (<i>n</i> = 4), N6 (<i>n</i> = 1), and two mixed infections (N3/N5 <i>n</i> = 2, and N2/N3 <i>n</i> = 1). H14 FLUAVs in Guatemala belong to a distinct H14 lineage in the Americas that is evolving independently from the Eurasian H14 lineage. Of note, the ORF of the H14 HA segments showed three distinct motifs at the cleavage site, two of these containing arginine instead of lysine in the first and fourth positions, not previously described in other countries. The effects of these mutations on virus replication, virulence, and/or transmission remain unknown and warrant further studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports genetic characterization of H14 influenza viruses and notes mutations with unknown effects on phenotype, without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: EPAC1 Pharmacological Inhibition with AM-001 Prevents SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus Replication in Cells.
Abstract: The exceptional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated an intense search for antiviral molecules. Host-targeted antiviral molecules have the potential of presenting broad-spectrum antiviral activity and are also considered as less likely to select for resistant viruses. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity exerted by AM-001, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of EPAC1, a host exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP-sensitive protein, EPAC1 regulates various physiological and pathological processes but its role in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection has not yet been studied. Here, we provide evidence that the EPAC1 specific inhibitor AM-001 exerts potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the human lung Calu-3 cell line and the African green monkey Vero cell line. We observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral particles and viral RNA release in the supernatants of AM-001 treated cells that was not associated with a significant impact on cellular viability. Furthermore, we identified AM-001 as an inhibitor of influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells. Altogether these results identify EPAC1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic target against viral infections.

Title: Genotype Diversity, Wild Bird-to-Poultry Transmissions, and Farm-to-Farm Carryover during the Spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in the Czech Republic in 2021/2022.
Abstract: In 2021/2022, the re-emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurred in Europe. The outbreak was seeded from two sources: resident and reintroduced viruses, which is unprecedented in the recorded history of avian influenza. The dominant subtype was H5N1, which replaced the H5N8 subtype that had predominated in previous seasons. In this study, we present a whole genome sequence and a phylogenetic analysis of 57 H5N1 HPAI and two low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N1 strains collected in the Czech Republic during 2021/2022. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relationships between H5N1 genomes from poultry and wild birds and secondary transmission in commercial geese. The genotyping showed considerable genetic heterogeneity among Czech H5N1 viruses, with six different HPAI genotypes, three of which were apparently unique. In addition, second-order reassortment relationships were observed with the direct involvement of co-circulating H5N1 LPAI strains. The genetic distance between Czech H5N1 HPAI and the closest LPAI segments available in the database illustrates the profound gaps in our knowledge of circulating LPAI strains. The changing dynamics of HPAI in the wild may increase the likelihood of future HPAI outbreaks and present new challenges in poultry management, biosecurity, and surveillance.

Title: A cross-sectional study of avian influenza A virus in Myanmar live bird markets: Detection of a newly introduced H9N2?
Abstract: Zoonotic influenza surveillance in Myanmar is sparse, despite the risks of introduction of such viruses from neighboring countries that could impact the poultry industry and lead to spillover to humans. In July and August 2019, our multi-institutional partnership conducted a One Health-oriented, cross-sectional surveillance (weekly for 3 weeks) for influenza A and influenza D viruses at the three largest live bird markets in Yangon, Myanmar. The 27 bioaerosols, 90 bird cage swabs, 90 bird oropharyngeals, and 90 human nasopharyngeal samples yielded molecular influenza A detections in 8 bioaerosols (30.0%), 16 bird cages (17.8%), 15 bird oropharyngeals (16.7%), and 1 human nasopharyngeal (1.1%) samples. No influenza D was detected. Seven of the influenza A virus detections were found to be subtype A/H9N2, and one human nasopharyngeal sample was found to be subtype A/H1pdm. Among all IAV-positive samples, three of the A/H9N2-positive samples yielded live viruses from egg culture and their whole genome sequences revealing they belonged to the G9/Y280 lineage of A/H9N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these A/H9N2 sequences clustered separately from A/H9N2 viruses that were previously detected in Myanmar, supporting the notion that A/H9N2 viruses similar to those seen in wider Southeast Asia may have been introduced to Myanmar on multiple occasions. These findings call for increased surveillance efforts in Myanmar to monitor for the introduction of novel influenza viruses in poultry, as well as possible reassortment and zoonotic virus transmission.

Title: Low prevalence of influenza viruses and predominance of A(H3N2) virus with respect to SARS-CoV-2 during the 2021-2022 season in Bulgaria.
Abstract: Social distancing, mask-wearing, and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the spread of influenza viruses. The objectives of this study were to analyze the pattern of influenza virus circulation with respect to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Bulgaria during the 2021-2022 season and to perform a phylogenetic/molecular analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences of representative influenza strains. Influenza infection was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 93 (4.2%) of the 2193 patients with acute respiratory illness tested wherein all detected viruses were subtyped as A(H3N2). SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 377 (24.3%) of the 1552 patients tested. Significant differences in the incidence of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 were found between individual age groups, outpatients/inpatients, and in the seasonal distribution of cases. Two cases of coinfections were identified. In hospitalized patients, the C<sub>t</sub> values of influenza viruses at admission were lower in adults aged ≥65 years (indicating higher viral load) than in children aged 0-14 years (p < 0.05). In SARS-CoV-2-positive inpatients, this association was not statistically significant. HA genes of all A(H3N2) viruses analyzed belonged to subclade 3C.2a1b.2a. The sequenced viruses carried 11 substitutions in HA and 5 in NA, in comparison to the vaccine virus A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020, including several substitutions in the HA antigenic sites B and C. This study revealed extensive changes in the typical epidemiology of influenza infection, including a dramatic reduction in the number of cases, diminished genetic diversity of circulating viruses, changes in age, and seasonal distribution of cases.

Title: Reintroduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H7N9 virus in southwestern China.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza A H7N9 virus has emerged in China since 2016. In recent years, it has been most prevalent in northern China. However, several strains of HP H7N9 reappeared in southwestern China (Yunnan Province) in 2021. As a result, we are wondering if these viruses have re-emerged in situ or been reintroduced. Here, we present phylogenetic evidence that the HP H7N9 viruses isolated in Yunnan emigrated from northern to southwestern China in 2020. The northern subregion of China has become a novel epicenter in HP H7N9 dissemination. Meanwhile, a cleavage motif re-emerged due to the T341I mutation, implying a parallel evolution. This cross-region transmission, which originated in non-adjacent provinces and traveled a great geographic distance in an unknown way, indicates that HP H7N9 dissemination did not halt in 2020, even under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional surveillance studies in poultry are required to determine the HP H7N9 virus's geographic distribution and spread.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics of Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Wild Birds in Moscow.
Abstract: Forty-five strains of AIVs were isolated from wild aquatic birds during their autumn migration through Moscow (Russia). The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of AIV genomes in their natural habitat. Viruses were isolated from fecal sample in embryonated chicken eggs; their complete genomes were sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The gene segments of the same lineage persisted over the years in the absence of persistence of complete viral genomes. The genes for internal proteins of the same lineage were often maintained by the viruses over few years; however, they were typically associated with the genes of novel HA and NA subtypes. Although frequent reassortment events were observed for any pair of internal genes, there was no reassortment between HA and NA segments. The differences in the persistence of phylogenetic lineages of surface and internal proteins and the different evolutionary strategy for these two types of genes of AIVs in primary hosts are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza virus genomes without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of new β-D-N<sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine analogs against SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and DENV-2.
Abstract: Drug repurposing approach was applied to find a potent antiviral agent against RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and dengue virus with a concise strategy of small change in parent molecular structure. For this purpose, β-D-N<sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine (NHC, 1) with a broad spectrum of antiviral activity was chosen as the parent molecule. Among the prepared NHC analogs (8a-g, and 9) from uridine, β-D-N<sup>4</sup>-O-isobutyrylcytidine (8a) showed potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 (EC<sub>50</sub> 3.50 μM), Flu A (H1N1) (EC<sub>50</sub> 5.80 μM), Flu A (H3N2) (EC<sub>50</sub> 7.30 μM), Flu B (EC<sub>50</sub> 3.40 μM) and DENV-2 (EC<sub>50</sub> 3.95 μM) in vitro. Furthermore, its potency against SARS-CoV-2 was >5-fold, 3.4-fold, and 3-fold compared to that of NHC (1), MK-4482 (2), and remdesivir (RDV) in vitro, respectively. Ultimately, compound 8a was expected to be a potent inhibitor toward RNA viruses as a viral mutagenic agent like MK-4482.

Title: Identification and genome sequencing of an influenza H3N2 variant in wastewater from elementary schools during a surge of influenza A cases in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Abstract: Real-time surveillance of infectious diseases at schools or in communities is often hampered by delays in reporting due to resource limitations and infrastructure issues. By incorporating quantitative PCR and genome sequencing, wastewater surveillance has been an effective complement to public health surveillance at the community and building-scale for pathogens such as poliovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and even the monkeypox virus. In this study, we asked whether wastewater surveillance programs at elementary schools could be leveraged to detect RNA from influenza viruses shed in wastewater. We monitored for influenza A and B viral RNA in wastewater from six elementary schools from January to May 2022. Quantitative PCR led to the identification of influenza A viral RNA at three schools, which coincided with the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and a surge in influenza A infections in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. We performed genome sequencing of wastewater RNA, leading to the identification of a 2021-2022 vaccine-resistant influenza A (H3N2) 3C.2a1b.2a.2 subclade. We next tested wastewater samples from a treatment plant that serviced the elementary schools, but we were unable to detect the presence of influenza A/B RNA. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of near-source wastewater surveillance for the detection of local influenza transmission in schools, which has the potential to be investigated further with paired school-level influenza incidence data.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on detection and sequencing of influenza virus RNA in wastewater but does not link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The role of influenza-A virus and coronavirus viral glycoprotein cleavage in host adaptation.
Abstract: While receptor binding is well recognized as a factor in influenza-A virus (IAV) and coronavirus (CoV) host adaptation, the role of viral glycoprotein cleavage has not been studied in detail so far. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that host species may differ in their protease repertoire available for cleavage. Furthermore, it was shown for certain bat-derived CoVs that proteolytic activation provides a critical barrier to infect human cells. Understanding the role of glycoprotein cleavage in different species and how IAV and CoVs adapt to a new protease repertoire may allow evaluating the zoonotic potential and risk posed by these viruses. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the emergence of a multibasic cleavage site (CS) in the glycoproteins of IAVs and CoVs in different host species. Additionally, we discuss the role of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in virus activation and entry and a role of neuropilin-1 in acquisition of a multibasic CS in different hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reviews the role of glycoprotein cleavage in host adaptation but does not present explicit experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Antiviral activities of plant-derived indole and β-carboline alkaloids against human and avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: The persistent evolution of drug-resistant influenza strains represents a global concern. The innovation of new treatment approaches through drug screening strategies and investigating the antiviral potential of bioactive natural-based chemicals may address the issue. Herein, we screened the anti-influenza efficacy of some biologically active indole and β-carboline (βC) indole alkaloids against two different influenza A viruses (IAV) with varied host range ranges; seasonal influenza A/Egypt/NRC098/2019(H1N1) and avian influenza A/chicken/Egypt/N12640A/2016(H5N1). All compounds were first assessed for their half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) in MDCK cells and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) against influenza A/H5N1. Intriguingly, Strychnine sulfate, Harmalol, Harmane, and Harmaline showed robust anti-H5N1 activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 11.85, 0.02, 0.023, and 3.42 µg/ml, respectively, as compared to zanamivir and amantadine as control drugs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.079 µg/ml and 17.59 µg/ml, respectively). The efficacy of the predefined phytochemicals was further confirmed against influenza A/H1N1 and they displayed potent anti-H1N1 activities compared to reference drugs. Based on SI values, the highly promising compounds were then evaluated for antiviral efficacy through plaque reduction assay and consistently they revealed high viral inhibition percentages at non-toxic concentrations. By studying the modes of antiviral action, Harmane and Harmalol could suppress viral infection via interfering mainly with the viral replication of the influenza A/H5N1 virus, whilst Harmaline exhibited a viricidal effect against the influenza A/H5N1 virus. Whereas, Strychnine sulfate elucidated its anti-influenza potency by interfering with viral adsorption into MDCK cells. Consistently, chemoinformatic studies showed that all studied phytochemicals illustrated HB formations with essential peptide cleft through the NH of indole moiety. Among active alkaloids, harmalol displayed the best lipophilicity metrics including ligand efficiency (LE) and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) for both viruses. Compounds geometry and their ability to participate in HB formation are very crucial.

Title: Spatial, temporal and evolutionary insight into seasonal epidemic Influenza A virus strains near the equatorial line: The case of Ecuador.
Abstract: To study the spatial and temporal patterns of Influenza A virus (IAV) is essential for an efficient control of the disease caused by IAV and efficient vaccination programs. However, spatiotemporal patterns of spread as well as genetic lineage circulation of IAV on a countrywide scale have not been clearly determined for many tropical regions of the world. In order to gain insight into these matters, the spatial and temporal patterns of IAV in six different geographic regions of Ecuador, from 2011 to 2021, were determined and the timing and magnitude of IAV outbreaks in these localities investigated. The results of these studies revealed that although Ecuador is a South American country situated in the Equator line, its IAV epidemiology resembles that of temperate Northern Hemisphere countries. Phylogenetic analysis of H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 IAV strains isolated in five different localities of Ecuador revealed that provinces in the south of this country have the largest effective population size by comparison with provinces in the north, suggesting that the southern provinces may be acting as a source of IAV. Co-circulation of different H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 genetic lineages was observed in different geographic regions of Ecuador.

Reason: The study analyzes spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic patterns of influenza A virus strains but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bidirectional Movement of Emerging H5N8 Avian Influenza Viruses Between Europe and Asia via Migratory Birds Since Early 2020.
Abstract: Migratory birds play a critical role in the rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 across Eurasia. Elucidating the timing and pattern of virus transmission is essential therefore for understanding the spatial dissemination of these viruses. In this study, we surveyed >27,000 wild birds in China, tracked the year-round migration patterns of 20 bird species across China since 2006, and generated new HPAI H5N8 virus genomic data. Using this new data set, we investigated the seasonal transmission dynamics of HPAI H5N8 viruses across Eurasia. We found that introductions of HPAI H5N8 viruses to different Eurasian regions were associated with the seasonal migration of wild birds. Moreover, we report a backflow of HPAI H5N8 virus lineages from Europe to Asia, suggesting that Europe acts as both a source and a sink in the global HPAI virus transmission network.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the movement and transmission dynamics of H5N8 viruses via migratory birds, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Interactomics: Dozens of Viruses, Co-evolving With Humans, Including the Influenza A Virus, may Actively Distort Human Aging.
Abstract: Some viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus 1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) have been experimentally proposed to accelerate features of human aging and of cellular senescence. These observations, along with evolutionary considerations on viral fitness, raised the more general puzzling hypothesis that, beyond documented sources in human genetics, aging in our species may also depend on virally encoded interactions distorting our aging to the benefits of diverse viruses. Accordingly, we designed systematic network-based analyses of the human and viral protein interactomes, which unraveled dozens of viruses encoding proteins experimentally demonstrated to interact with proteins from pathways associated with human aging, including cellular senescence. We further corroborated our predictions that specific viruses interfere with human aging using published experimental evidence and transcriptomic data; identifying influenza A virus (subtype H1N1) as a major candidate age distorter, notably through manipulation of cellular senescence. By providing original evidence that viruses may convergently contribute to the evolution of numerous age-associated pathways through co-evolution, our network-based and bipartite network-based methodologies support an ecosystemic study of aging, also searching for genetic causes of aging outside a focal aging species. Our findings, predicting age distorters and targets for anti-aging therapies among human viruses, could have fundamental and practical implications for evolutionary biology, aging study, virology, medicine, and demography.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses network-based analyses to predict viral interactions with human aging pathways but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Abstract: In January 2022, significant mortality was observed among Cape cormorants (<i>Phalacrocorax capensis</i>) on the west coast of Namibia. Samples collected were shown to be positive for H5N1 avian influenza by multiplex RT-qPCR. Full genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis identified the viruses as belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b and that it clustered with similar viruses identified in Lesotho and Botswana in 2021. This is the first genomic characterization of H5N1 viruses in Namibia and has important implications for poultry disease management and wildlife conservation in the region.

Title: Protein-Coding Region Derived Small RNA in Exosomes from Influenza A Virus-Infected Cells.
Abstract: Exosomes may function as multifactorial mediators of cell-to-cell communication, playing crucial roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Exosomes released from virus-infected cells may contain RNA and proteins facilitating infection spread. The purpose of our study was to analyze how the small RNA content of exosomes is affected by infection with the influenza A virus (IAV). Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation after hemadsorption of virions and their small RNA content was identified using high-throughput sequencing. As compared to mock-infected controls, 856 RNA transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in exosomes from IAV-infected cells, including fragments of 458 protein-coding (pcRNA), 336 small, 28 long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts, and 33 pseudogene transcripts. Upregulated pcRNA species corresponded mainly to proteins associated with translation and antiviral response, and the most upregulated among them were <i>RSAD2</i>, <i>CCDC141</i> and <i>IFIT2</i>. Downregulated pcRNA species corresponded to proteins associated with the cell cycle and DNA packaging. Analysis of differentially expressed pseudogenes showed that in most cases, an increase in the transcription level of pseudogenes was correlated with an increase in their parental genes. Although the role of exosome RNA in IAV infection remains undefined, the biological processes identified based on the corresponding proteins may indicate the roles of some of its parts in IAV replication.

Reason: The paper analyzes small RNA content in exosomes from influenza-infected cells but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Isolation and Identification of Novel Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N8) Subclade 2.3.4.4b from Geese in Northeastern China.
Abstract: H5N8, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, has become a new zoonotic threat in recent years. As of December 28, 2021, at least 3,206 H5N8 cases had been reported in wild birds and poultry worldwide. In January 2021, a novel virus strain named A/goose/China/1/2021 was isolated during an H5N8 goose influenza outbreak in northeastern China. The PB2, PB1, HA, and M genes of A/goose/China/1/2021 were highly identical to those of H5N8 strains emerging in Kazakhstan and Russia in Central Asia from August to September 2020, while the remaining four genes had the closest homology to those of H5N8 viruses isolated in South Korea in East Asia from November to December 2020. We thus speculate that A/goose/China/1/2021 is likely a reassortant virus that formed in the 2020 to 2021 influenza season and that the migratory birds via the two migration routes of Central Asia and East Asia-Australia may have played an essential role in the genetic reassortment of this virus. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA genes of H5N8 viruses belonging to group II of subclade 2.3.4.4b, including A/goose/China/1/2021, may be derived from strains in Central Asia. Given the complex global spread of H5N8 virus, our study highlights the necessity to strengthen the function of the global surveillance network for H5N8 virus and to accelerate the pace of vaccine development to confront the current challenges posed by H5N8 virus of subclade 2.3.4.4. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> H5N8, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, not only has an impact on public health, but also has a huge negative impact on animal health, food safety, safety, and even on the local and international economy. The migratory wild birds play a vital role in the intercontinental transmission of H5N8 virus. It is urgent that we should strengthen the function of the global surveillance network for H5N8 virus and accelerate the pace of vaccine development to confront the current challenges posed by H5N8 virus of subclade 2.3.4.4.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Technologically Processed Antibodies to CD4 Receptor against Influenza Infection.
Abstract: The antiviral activity of technologically processed antibodies to CD4 receptor was evaluated a model of sublethal A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-induced influenza infection in female BALB/c mice. The technologically processed antibodies increased animal survival rate by 50% in comparison with the placebo group (p<0.05), which correlated with significant inhibition of virus replication in the lungs (p<0.05). The reference drug Tamiflu increased mouse survival rate (by 47%), decreased the virus titer in the lungs, and prevented body weight loss (p<0.05 in comparison with the placebo group by all parameters). The intrinsic protective activity of technologically processed antibodies to CD4 receptor was demonstrated, which manifested in a decrease in viral load in the lower respiratory tract and an increase in the survival rate.

Title: Influenza A viruses circulating in dogs: A review of the scientific literature.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause persistent epidemics and occasional human pandemics, leading to considerable economic losses. The ecology and epidemiology of IAV are very complex and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens is one of the greatest challenges in the healthcare. IAV are characterized by genetic and antigenic variability resulting from a combination of high mutation rates and a segmented genome that provides the ability to rapidly change and adapt to new hosts. In this context, available scientific evidence is of great importance for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of influenza viruses. The present review summarizes original research papers and IAV infections reported in dogs all over the world. Reports of interspecies transmission of equine influenza viruses H3N2 from birds to dogs, as well as double and triple reassortant strains resulting from reassortment of avian, human, and canine strains have amplified the genetic variety of canine influenza viruses. A total of 146 articles were deemed acceptable by PubMed and the Google Scholar database and were therefore included in this review. The largest number of research articles (<i>n</i> = 68) were published in Asia, followed by the Americas (<i>n</i> = 44), Europe (<i>n</i> = 31), Africa (<i>n</i> = 2), and Australia (<i>n</i> = 1). Publications are conventionally divided into three categories. The first category (largest group) included modern articles published from 2011 to the present (<i>n</i> = 93). The second group consisted of publications from 2000 to 2010 (<i>n</i> = 46). Single papers of 1919, 1931, 1963, 1972, 1975, and 1992 were also used, which was necessary to emphasize the history of the study of the ecology and evolution of the IAV circulating among various mammalian species. The largest number of publications occurred in 2010 (<i>n</i> = 18) and 2015 (<i>n</i> = 11), which is associated with IAV outbreaks observed at that time in the dog population in America, Europe, and Asia. In general, these findings raise concerns that dogs may mediate the adaptation of IAVs to zoonotic transmission and therefore serve as alternative hosts for genetic reassortment of these viruses. The global concern and significant threat to public health from the present coronavirus diseases 2019 pandemic confirms the necessity for active surveillance of zoonotic viral diseases with pandemic potential.

Title: Integrating Citizen Scientist Data into the Surveillance System for Avian Influenza Virus, Taiwan.
Abstract: The continuing circulation and reassortment with low-pathogenicity avian influenza Gs/Gd (goose/Guangdong/1996)-like avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has caused huge economic losses and raised public health concerns over the zoonotic potential. Virologic surveillance of wild birds has been suggested as part of a global AIV surveillance system. However, underreporting and biased selection of sampling sites has rendered gaining information about the transmission and evolution of highly pathogenic AIV problematic. We explored the use of the Citizen Scientist eBird database to elucidate the dynamic distribution of wild birds in Taiwan and their potential for AIV exchange with domestic poultry. Through the 2-stage analytical framework, we associated nonignorable risk with 10 species of wild birds with >100 significant positive results. We generated a risk map, which served as the guide for highly pathogenic AIV surveillance. Our methodologic blueprint has the potential to be incorporated into the global AIV surveillance system of wild birds.

Title: Current situation and control strategies of H9N2 avian influenza in South Korea.
Abstract: The H9N2 avian influenza (AI) has become endemic in poultry in many countries since the 1990s, which has caused considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Considering the long history of the low pathogenicity H9N2 AI in many countries, once H9N2 AI is introduced, it is more difficult to eradicate than high pathogenicity AI. Various preventive measures and strategies, including vaccination and active national surveillance, have been used to control the Y439 lineage of H9N2 AI in South Korea, but it took a long time for the H9N2 virus to disappear from the fields. By contrast, the novel Y280 lineage of H9N2 AI was introduced in June 2020 and has spread nationwide. This study reviews the history, genetic and pathogenic characteristics, and control strategies for Korean H9N2 AI. This review may provide some clues for establishing control strategies for endemic AIV and a newly introduced Y280 lineage of H9N2 AI in South Korea.

Title: Analysis of Avian Influenza (H5N5) Viruses Isolated in the Southwestern European Part of the Russian Federation in 2020-2021.
Abstract: In 2021, several isolates of the H5N5 avian influenza virus (AIV) were detected in Europe and the Russian Federation, which differed from those detected in 2020. Genetic analysis revealed a relationship between the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N5 subtype, detected in Europe, and some isolates detected in the Russian Federation territory in 2020-2021: it was shown that both originated in the Caspian Sea regions around the autumn of 2020. The appearance of H5N5 subtype viruses in the spring of 2021 in Europe and the Russian Federation was not associated with the mass migration of birds from Africa. The results of the analysis revealed the presence of a deletion in the stem of a neuraminidase between bp 139 and 204 (open reading frame). It has been shown that AIVs of the H5N5 subtype are capable of long-term circulation in wild bird populations with the possibility of reassortment. The results also highlighted the need for careful monitoring of the circulation of AIVs in the Caspian Sea region, the role of which, in the preservation and emergence of new antigenic variants of such viruses in Eurasia, is currently underestimated.

Title: Monitoring of Avian Influenza Viruses and Paramyxoviruses in Ponds of Moscow and the Moscow Region.
Abstract: The ponds of the Moscow region during the autumn migration of birds are a place with large concentrations of mallard ducks, which are the main hosts of avulaviruses (avian paramyxoviruses) and influenza A viruses (IAV). The purpose of this study was the determination of the biological diversity of IAV and avulaviruses isolated from mallards in Moscow's ponds. A phylogenetic analysis of IAV was performed based on complete genome sequencing, and virus genomic reassortment in nature was studied. Almost all IAV genome segments clustered with apathogenic duck viruses according to phylogenetic analysis. The origin of the genes of Moscow isolates were different; some of them belong to European evolutionary branches, some to Asian ones. The majority of closely related viruses have been isolated in the Western Eurasian region. Much less frequently, closely related viruses have been isolated in Siberia, China, and Korea. The quantity and diversity of isolated viruses varied considerably depending on the year and have decreased since 2014, perhaps due to the increasing proportion of nesting and wintering ducks in Moscow.

Title: Emergence of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b in Wild Birds and Poultry in Botswana.
Abstract: Numerous outbreaks of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) were reported during 2020-2021. In Africa, H5Nx has been detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa in both wild birds and poultry. Botswana reported its first outbreak of HPAI to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) in 2021. An H5N1 virus was detected in a fish eagle, doves, and chickens. Full genome sequence analysis revealed that the virus belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b and showed high identity within haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase proteins (NA) for viruses identified across a geographically broad range of locations. The detection of H5N1 in Botswana has important implications for disease management, wild bird conservation, tourism, public health, economic empowerment of vulnerable communities and food security in the region.

Title: Propagation of avian influenza virus in embryonated ostrich eggs.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are typically isolated and cultured by successive passages using 9- to 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) and in 14-day old ECEs for virus mutational studies. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCRs) are commonly used for IAV diagnosis, but virus isolation remains invaluable in terms of its high sensitivity, providing viable isolates for further studies and the ability to distinguish between viable and nonviable virus. Efforts at isolating ostrich-origin IAVs from RT-PCR positive specimens using ECEs have often been unsuccessful, raising the possibility of a species bottleneck, whereby ostrich-adapted IAVs may not readily infect and replicate in ECEs, yet the capacity of an ostrich embryo to support the replication of influenza viruses has not been previously demonstrated. This study describes an optimised method for H5 and H7 subtype IAV isolation and propagation in 28-day old embryonated ostrich eggs (EOEs), the biological equivalent of 14-day old ECEs. The viability of EOEs transported from breeding sites could be maximised by pre-incubating the eggs for 12 to 14 days prior to long-distance transportation. This method applied to studies for ostrich-adapted virus isolation and in ovo studies will enable better understanding of the virus-host interaction in ostriches and the emergence of potentially zoonotic diseases.

Title: B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins-activated proteases as potential therapeutic targets for influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2: Killing two birds with one stone?
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global health emergency. There are many similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV); both are single-stranded RNA viruses infecting airway epithelial cells and have similar modes of replication and transmission. Like IAVs, SARS-CoV-2 infections poses serious challenges due to the lack of effective therapeutic interventions, frequent appearances of new strains of the virus, and development of drug resistance. New approaches to control these infectious agents may stem from cellular factors or pathways that directly or indirectly interact with viral proteins to enhance or inhibit virus replication. One of the emerging concepts is that host cellular factors and pathways are required for maintaining viral genome integrity, which is essential for viral replication. Although IAVs have been studied for several years and many cellular proteins involved in their replication and pathogenesis have been identified, very little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cellular proteins to promote their replication. IAV induces apoptotic cell death, mediated by the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins in infected epithelia, and the pro-apoptotic members of this family promotes viral replication by activating host cell proteases. This review compares the life cycle and mode of replication of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 and examines the potential roles of host cellular proteins, belonging to the Bcl-2 family, in SARS-CoV-2 replication to provide future research directions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review comparing host Bcl-2 family proteins' roles in influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication; it does not present explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Plantaricin NC8 αβ rapidly and efficiently inhibits flaviviruses and SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting their envelopes.
Abstract: Potent broad-spectrum antiviral agents are urgently needed to combat existing and emerging viral infections. This is particularly important considering that vaccine development is a costly and time consuming process and that viruses constantly mutate and render the vaccine ineffective. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP), such as bacteriocins, are attractive candidates as antiviral agents against enveloped viruses. One of these bacteriocins is PLNC8 αβ, which consists of amphipathic peptides with positive net charges that display high affinity for negatively charged pathogen membrane structures, including phosphatidylserine rich lipid membranes of viral envelopes. Due to the morphological and physiological differences between viral envelopes and host cell plasma membranes, PLNC8 αβ is thought to have high safety profile by specifically targeting viral envelopes without effecting host cell membranes. In this study, we have tested the antiviral effects of PLNC8 αβ against the flaviviruses Langat and Kunjin, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The concentration of PLNC8 αβ that is required to eliminate all the infective virus particles is in the range of nanomolar (nM) to micromolar (μM), which is surprisingly efficient considering the high content of cholesterol (8-35%) in their lipid envelopes. We found that viruses replicating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi complex, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and flaviviruses, are considerably more susceptible to PLNC8 αβ, compared to viruses that acquire their lipid envelope from the plasma membrane, such as IAV and HIV-1. Development of novel broad-spectrum antiviral agents can significantly benefit human health by rapidly and efficiently eliminating infectious virions and thereby limit virus dissemination and spreading between individuals. PLNC8 αβ can potentially be developed into an effective and safe antiviral agent that targets the lipid compartments of viral envelopes of extracellular virions, more or less independent of virus antigenic mutations, which faces many antiviral drugs and vaccines.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper tests an antimicrobial peptide's antiviral activity against multiple viruses including influenza A virus, focusing on envelope disruption rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: sitePath: a visual tool to identify polymorphism clades and help find fixed and parallel mutations.
Abstract: Identifying polymorphism clades on phylogenetic trees could help detect punctual mutations that are associated with viral functions. With visualization tools coloring the tree, it is easy to visually find clades where most sequences have the same polymorphism state. However, with the fast accumulation of viral sequences, a computational tool to automate this process is urgently needed. Here, by implementing a branch-and-bound-like search method, we developed an R package named sitePath to identify polymorphism clades automatically. Based on the identified polymorphism clades, fixed and parallel mutations could be inferred. Furthermore, sitePath also integrated visualization tools to generate figures of the calculated results. In an example with the influenza A virus H3N2 dataset, the detected fixed mutations coincide with antigenic shift mutations. The highly specificity and sensitivity of sitePath in finding fixed mutations were achieved for a range of parameters and different phylogenetic tree inference software. The result suggests that sitePath can identify polymorphism clades per site. The clustering of sequences on a phylogenetic tree can be used to infer fixed and parallel mutations. High-quality figures of the calculated results could also be generated by sitePath.

Title: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Bisphosphate Mediates the Co-Distribution of Influenza A Hemagglutinin and Matrix Protein M1 at the Plasma Membrane.
Abstract: The fully assembled influenza A virus (IAV) has on its surface the highest density of a single membrane protein found in nature-the glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) that mediates viral binding, entry, and assembly. HA clusters at the plasma membrane of infected cells, and the HA density (number of molecules per unit area) of these clusters correlates with the infectivity of the virus. Dense HA clusters are considered to mark the assembly site and ultimately lead to the budding of infectious IAV. The mechanism of spontaneous HA clustering, which occurs with or without other viral components, has not been elucidated. Using super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM), we have previously shown that these HA clusters are interdependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). Here, we show that the IAV matrix protein M1 co-clusters with PIP2, visualized using the pleckstrin homology domain. We find that cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which is a positively charged quaternary ammonium compound known for its antibacterial and antiviral properties at millimolar concentrations, disrupts M1 clustering and M1-PIP2 co-clustering at micromolar concentrations well below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). CPC also disrupts the co-clustering of M1 with HA at the plasma membrane, suggesting the role of host cell PIP2 clusters as scaffolds for gathering and concentrating M1 and HA to achieve their unusually high cluster densities in the IAV envelope.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the co-distribution and clustering of viral proteins and host lipids at the plasma membrane, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: No molecular evidence for influenza A virus and coronavirus in bats belonging to the families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate, by molecular methods, the presence of influenza A virus (IAV) and coronavirus in non-hematophagous bats collected in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Samples of lung tissue and small intestine from 105 bats belonging to three families (Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) were collected in 22 municipalities in the state of São Paulo. Genetic identification of bats species was performed by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of 710 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene. In the detection of IAV, genomes were performed by RT-PCR, aiming at the amplification of a 245-bp fragment of the IAV matrix (M) protein gene. For coronaviruses, two fragments of 602 and 440 bp corresponding to segments along the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were targeted. The detection limit for each of the PCRs was also determined. All samples analyzed here were negative for both viruses, and the lower limit of detection of the PCRs for the amplification of influenza virus A and coronavirus was estimated at 3.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 4.59 genomic copies per microliter, respectively. Although bats have been shown to harbor a large number of pathogens, the results of the present study support the theory that virus circulation in bats in the wild often occurs at low viral loads and that our understanding of the complex infectious dynamics of these viruses in wild conditions is still limited.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study reports negative molecular detection results for influenza A virus and coronavirus in bats, without any genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Modeling COVID-19 transmission between age groups in the United States considering virus mutations, vaccinations, and reinfection.
Abstract: The in-depth understanding of the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission among different age groups is of great interest for governments and health authorities so that strategies can be devised to reduce the pandemic's detrimental effects. We developed the SIRDV-Virulence (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Vaccinated-Virulence) epidemiological model based on a population balance equation to study the effects virus mutants, vaccination strategies, 'Anti/Non Vaxxer' proportions, and reinfection rates to provide methods to mitigate COVID-19 transmission among the United States population. Based on publicly available data, we obtain the key parameters governing the spread of the pandemic. The results show that a large fraction of infected cases comes from the adult and children populations in the presence of a highly infectious COVID-19 mutant. Given the situation at the end of July 2021, the results show that prioritizing children and adult vaccinations over that of seniors can contain the spread of the active cases, thereby preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed and minimizing subsequent deaths. The model suggests that the only option to curb the effects of this pandemic is to reduce the population of unvaccinated individuals. A higher fraction of 'Anti/Non-vaxxers' and a higher reinfection rate can both independently lead to the resurgence of the pandemic.

Title: Aerosol exposure of live bird market workers to viable influenza A/H5N1 and A/H9N2 viruses, Cambodia.
Abstract: Live bird markets (LBMs) have been identified as key factors in the spread, persistence and evolution of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In addition, these settings have been associated with human infections with AIVs of pandemic concern. Exposure to aerosolised AIVs by workers in a Cambodian LBM was assessed using aerosol impact samplers. LBM vendors were asked to wear an air sampler for 30 min per day for 1 week while continuing their usual activities in the LBM during a period of high AIV circulation (February) and a period of low circulation (May). During the period of high circulation, AIV RNA was detected from 100% of the air samplers using molecular methods and viable AIV (A/H5N1 and/or A/H9N2) was isolated from 50% of air samplers following inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs. In contrast, AIV was not detected by molecular methods or successfully isolated during the period of low circulation. This study demonstrates the increased risk of aerosol exposure of LBM workers to AIVs during periods of high circulation and highlights the need for interventions during these high-risk periods. Novel approaches, such as environmental sampling, should be further explored at key high-risk interfaces as a potentially cost-effective alternative for monitoring pandemic threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study assesses aerosol exposure to viable influenza viruses but does not investigate genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Prevalence of the H5N8 influenza virus in birds: Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, considered highly pathogenic (HPAI). They result from genetic variations from their low virulence predecessors. HPAI is a global problem. Large outbreaks of HAPI have significant health and economic impacts. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of the H5N8 Influenza virus in birds, as well as to assess its variability according to the countries and years. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in six databases (Web of Sciences, Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, Lilacs and Google Scholar) to evaluate the proportion of birds infected with the H5N8 Influenza virus, by molecular and immunological techniques. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A 2-tailed 5% alpha level was used for hypothesis testing. Measures of heterogeneity were estimated and reported, including the Cochrane Q statistic, the I<sup>2</sup> index, and the tau-squared test. In addition, bird species performed subgroup analyzes. 152 data groups were analyzed, a combined prevalence of 1.6% (95% CI 1.3-1.9%) was found for molecular studies, and the ELISA study yielded a seroprevalence of 66.7%; those results of molecular detection varied by year, from 0.2% in 2014 to 52.6% in 2020 and 96.9% in 2015. The combined prevalence was substantial because large outbreaks have caused severe economic repercussions. In addition, it is considered a serious concern for public health due to its possible zoonotic activity.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of H5N8 prevalence in birds, without direct genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: eIF4A3 Promotes RNA Viruses' Replication by Inhibiting Innate Immune Responses.
Abstract: Viral infection activates the type I interferons (IFNs) and cellular antiviral responses. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3) has been shown to promote influenza A virus (IAV) replication by promoting viral mRNA splicing and spliced mRNA nuclear export. Here, we identified eIF4A3 as a negative regulator of virus-triggered type I IFN induction. Our study found that eIF4A3 promoted multiple RNA viruses' replication by binding to IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and impaired the interaction between tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3, leading to attenuation of the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1, the formation of IRF3 dimer, and the nuclear translocation of IRF3. This impaired its biological functions in the nucleus, which blocked IRF3 binding to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and the interaction of IRF3 and CBP/p300, resulting in inhibiting the transcription of IFN-β and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby impairing innate antiviral immune responses against RNA viruses. These findings reveal a previously unknown function of eIF4A3 in host innate immunity and establish a mechanistic link between eIF4A3 and IRF3 activation that expands potential therapeutic strategies for viral infectious diseases. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Production of type I IFN is pivotal for the cellular antiviral immunity. Virus infection leads to the activation of transcription factor IRF3 and subsequent production of type I IFN to eliminate viral infection. Thus, the regulation of IRF3 activity is an important way to affect type I IFN production. IRF3 activation requires phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation. Here, we first reported that eIF4A3, a member of DEAD box family, served as a negative regulator of antiviral innate immune responses by inhibiting IRF3 activation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 binds to IRF3 to impair the recruitment of IRF3 by TBK1, which is independent of eIF4A3 ATP binding, ATPase, and RNA helicase activities. Our study delineates a common mechanism of eIF4A3 promoting replication of different RNA viruses and provides important insights into the negative regulation of host antiviral innate immune responses against virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of host factor eIF4A3 in promoting RNA virus replication by inhibiting innate immune responses, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Revisiting influenza A virus life cycle from a perspective of genome balance.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) genome comprises eight negative-sense RNA segments, of which the replication is well orchestrated and the delicate balance of multiple segments are dynamically regulated throughout IAV life cycle. However, previous studies seldom discuss these balances except for functional hemagglutinin-neuraminidase balance that is pivotal for both virus entry and release. Therefore, we attempt to revisit IAV life cycle by highlighting the critical role of "genome balance". Moreover, we raise a "balance regression" model of IAV evolution that the virus evolves to rebalance its genome after reassortment or interspecies transmission, and direct a "balance compensation" strategy to rectify the "genome imbalance" as a result of artificial modifications during creation of recombinant IAVs. This review not only improves our understanding of IAV life cycle, but also facilitates both basic and applied research of IAV in future.

Title: Evolution of Influenza Viruses-Drug Resistance, Treatment Options, and Prospects.
Abstract: Viral evolution refers to the genetic changes that a virus accumulates during its lifetime which can arise from adaptations in response to environmental changes or the immune response of the host. Influenza A virus is one of the most rapidly evolving microorganisms. Its genetic instability may lead to large changes in its biological properties, including changes in virulence, adaptation to new hosts, and even the emergence of infectious diseases with a previously unknown clinical course. Genetic variability makes it difficult to implement effective prophylactic programs, such as vaccinations, and may be responsible for resistance to antiviral drugs. The aim of the review was to describe the consequences of the variability of influenza viruses, mutations, and recombination, which allow viruses to overcome species barriers, causing epidemics and pandemics. Another consequence of influenza virus evolution is the risk of the resistance to antiviral drugs. Thus far, one class of drugs, M2 protein inhibitors, has been excluded from use because of mutations in strains isolated in many regions of the world from humans and animals. Therefore, the effectiveness of anti-influenza drugs should be continuously monitored in reference centers representing particular regions of the world as a part of epidemiological surveillance.

Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus evolution and drug resistance broadly, without explicit experimental links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Two Novel Avian Influenza Virus Subtypes Isolated from Domestic Ducks in North of Iran.
Abstract: Avian Influenza Viruses (AIV) are the causative agents of Avian Influenza (AI), which is a contagious and zoonotic disease in birds. Among birds, wild waterfowls and ducks are the primary and natural reservoirs of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI). This study aimed to identify and differentiate between two AIV subtypes (i.e., hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from domestic ducks by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays. To this end, 962 cloacal swabs were collected from domestic ducks being sold at different Iranian Live Bird Markets in Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan provinces, located at the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The samples were inoculated in 10-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs, and subsequently, harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to agar gel immunodiffusion, HI, and NI assays. In total, five positive samples, including two H4N2 and three H3N2 AIV subtypes were identified. Isolation of H4N2 and H3N2 viruses has never been reported from Iranian domestic ducks previously. This finding further suggests the diversity of LPAI viruses in Iranian ducks and also shows that the HI and NI assays are highly efficient in determining AIV subtypes.

Title: Anti-influenza A virus activity by Agrimonia pilosa and Galla rhois extract mixture.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to threaten human health. To date, two classes of antiviral drugs have been approved to treat IAV infection, but the continuous emergence of the drug-resistant IAV mutant reinforces the need to develop new antiviral drugs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-IAV activity of an aqueous mixture of Agrimonia pilosa and Galla rhois extracts (APRG64). We demonstrated that APRG64 significantly reduced the IAV-induced cytopathic effect, the transcription/expression of viral proteins, and the production of infectious viral particles. Among nine major components of APRG64, apigenin was identified as the main ingredient responsible for the anti-IAV activity. Interestingly, APRG64 and apigenin inhibited the cell attachment and entry of virus and polymerase activity. Importantly, intranasal administration of APRG64 or apigenin strongly reduced viral loads in the lungs of IAV-infected mice. Furthermore, oral administration of APRG64 significantly reduced the level of viral RNAs and the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, which protected mice from IAV-induced mortality. In conclusion, APRG64 could be an attractive antiviral drug to treat IAV infection.

Title: Alternative antiviral approaches to combat influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A (IAV) is a major human respiratory pathogen that contributes to a significant threat to health security, worldwide. Despite vaccinations and previous immunisations through infections, humans can still be infected with influenza several times throughout their lives. This phenomenon is attributed to the antigenic changes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins in IAV via genetic mutation and reassortment, conferring antigenic drift and antigenic shift, respectively. Numerous findings indicate that slow antigenic drift and reassortment-derived antigenic shift exhibited by IAV are key processes that allow IAVs to overcome the previously acquired host immunity, which eventually leads to the annual re-emergence of seasonal influenza and even pandemic influenza, in rare occasions. As a result, current therapeutic options hit a brick wall quickly. As IAV remains a constant threat for new outbreaks worldwide, the underlying processes of genetic changes and alternative antiviral approaches for IAV should be further explored to improve disease management. In the light of the above, this review discusses the characteristics and mechanisms of mutations and reassortments that contribute to IAV's evolution. We also discuss several alternative RNA-targeting antiviral approaches, namely the CRISPR/Cas13 systems, RNA interference (RNAi), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) as potential antiviral approaches against IAV.

Title: Global dissemination of influenza A virus is driven by wild bird migration through arctic and subarctic zones.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) circulate endemically among many wild aquatic bird populations that seasonally migrate between wintering grounds in southern latitudes to breeding ranges along the perimeter of the circumpolar arctic. Arctic and subarctic zones are hypothesized to serve as ecologic drivers of the intercontinental movement and reassortment of IAVs due to high densities of disparate populations of long distance migratory and native bird species present during breeding seasons. Iceland is a staging ground that connects the East Atlantic and North Atlantic American flyways, providing a unique study system for characterizing viral flow between eastern and western hemispheres. Using Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we sought to evaluate the viral connectivity of Iceland to proximal regions and how inter-species transmission and reassortment dynamics in this region influence the geographic spread of low and highly pathogenic IAVs. Findings demonstrate that IAV movement in the arctic and subarctic reflects wild bird migration around the perimeter of the circumpolar north, favouring short-distance flights between proximal regions rather than long distance flights over the polar interior. Iceland connects virus movement between mainland Europe and North America, consistent with the westward migration of wild birds from mainland Europe to Northeastern Canada and Greenland. Though virus diffusion rates were similar among avian taxonomic groups in Iceland, gulls play an outsized role as sinks of IAVs from other avian hosts prior to onward migration. These data identify patterns of virus movement in northern latitudes and inform future surveillance strategies related to seasonal and emergent IAVs with potential public health concern.

Title: Antiviral activity of soybean GL 2626/96 (Glycine max) ethanolic extract against influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections in humans with high morbidity and mortality rates. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and peramivir are the most commonly used drugs for influenza virus infections. However, the emergence of resistant viruses necessitates the urgent need to develop next-generation anti-influenza drugs. Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is widely cultivated and used as food worldwide. In addition, soybean has long been used as a nutritional supplement and herbal medicine. However, the potential anti-influenza properties of the soybean cultivar "GL 2626/96″ (SG2626) are yet to be investigated. Herein, we determined whether the ethanolic extract of SG2626 (SG2626E) has anti-viral activity through performing SG2626E pre-, co-, and post-treatment assays, using the influenza green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged influenza A/PR/8/34 (A/PR/8/34-GFP) virus. SG2626E showed anti-influenza virus activity in pre- and co-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner, but not in post-treated cells. SG2626E imparted a considerable inhibitory effect on influenza A virus (IAV) infection through blocking viral attachment. SG2626E inhibited the activity of viral hemagglutinin, but not viral neuraminidase of the IAV. SG2626E inhibited IAV infection by reducing intracellular calcium levels in infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. Additionally, SG2626E reduced body weight loss, decreased mortality, and increased the survival rate through reducing viral replication in the lungs of IAV-infected mice. Overall, these results suggest that SG2626E inhibits IAV infection and is a potential novel anti-influenza agent.

Title: Modulating cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to disrupt influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is widely disseminated across different species and can cause recurrent epidemics and severe pandemics in humans. During infection, IAV attaches to receptors that are predominantly located in cell membrane regions known as lipid rafts, which are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Following IAV entry into the host cell, uncoating, transcription, and replication of the viral genome occur, after which newly synthesized viral proteins and genomes are delivered to lipid rafts for assembly prior to viral budding from the cell. Moreover, during budding, IAV acquires an envelope with embedded cholesterol from the host cell membrane, and it is known that decreased cholesterol levels on IAV virions reduce infectivity. Statins are commonly used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis for preventing cardiovascular diseases, and several studies have investigated whether such inhibition can block IAV infection and propagation, as well as modulate the host immune response to IAV. Taken together, current research suggests that there may be a role for statins in countering IAV infections and modulating the host immune response to prevent or mitigate cytokine storms, and further investigation into this is warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews the role of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in influenza infection and statins as modulators but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza during 2020-2021.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a total of 2,393 human influenza positive samples between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 (2020: n = 2,021 samples; 2021: n = 372 samples). Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or embryonated hen's eggs for potential use in seasonal influenza virus vaccines. During 2020-2021, influenza A viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2020 and A(H3N2) in 2021) predominated over influenza B viruses. In 2020, the majority of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the southern hemisphere in 2020. In 2021, the majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were found to be antigenically distinct relative to the WHO recommended vaccine strains for the southern hemisphere in 2021. Of the influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre, 46.7% were found to be antigenically distinct to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains. Of 1,538 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (in 2020, n = 1,374; in 2021, n = 164), two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition against oseltamivir, and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition against zanamivir. All of these samples were received in 2020.

Title: FDA-Approved Inhibitors of RTK/Raf Signaling Potently Impair Multiple Steps of In Vitro and Ex Vivo Influenza A Virus Infections.
Abstract: Influenza virus (IV) infections pose a burden on global public health with significant morbidity and mortality. The limited range of currently licensed IV antiviral drugs is susceptible to the rapid rise of resistant viruses. In contrast, FDA-approved kinase inhibitors can be repurposed as fast-tracked host-targeted antivirals with a higher barrier of resistance. Extending our recent studies, we screened 21 FDA-approved small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) and identified seven candidates as potent inhibitors of pandemic and seasonal IV infections. These SMKIs were further validated in a biologically and clinically relevant ex vivo model of human precision-cut lung slices. We identified steps of the virus infection cycle affected by these inhibitors (entry, replication, egress) and found that most SMKIs affected both entry and egress. Based on defined and overlapping targets of these inhibitors, the candidate SMKIs target receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of Raf/MEK/ERK pathways to limit influenza A virus infection. Our data and the established safety profiles of these SMKIs support further clinical investigations and repurposing of these SMKIs as host-targeted influenza therapeutics.

Title: Wild Bird Surveillance in the Gauteng Province of South Africa during the High-Risk Period for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Introduction.
Abstract: Migratory birds carried clade 2.3.4.4B H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses to South Africa in 2017, 2018 and 2021, where the Gauteng Province is a high-risk zone for virus introduction. Here, we combined environmental faecal sampling with sensitive rRT-PCR methods and direct Ion Torrent sequencing to survey wild populations between February and May 2022. An overall IAV incidence of 42.92% (100/231) in water bird faecal swab pools or swabs from moribund or dead European White Storks (<i>Ciconia ciconia</i>) was detected. In total, 7% of the IAV-positive pools tested H5-positive, with clade 2.3.4.4B H5N1 HPAI confirmed in the storks; 10% of the IAV-positive samples were identified as H9N2, and five complete H9N2 genomes were phylogenetically closely related to a local 2021 wild duck H9N2 virus, recent Eurasian LPAI viruses or those detected in commercial ostriches in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces since 2018. H3N1, H4N2, H5N2 and H8Nx subtypes were also identified. Targeted surveillance of wild birds using environmental faecal sampling can thus be effectively applied under sub-Saharan African conditions, but region-specific studies should first be used to identify peak prevalence times which, in southern Africa, is linked to the peak rainfall period, when ducks are reproductively active.

Title: Apolipoprotein E mediates cell resistance to influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Viruses exploit host cell machinery to support their replication. Defining the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease and designing host-directed therapeutics. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening in lung epithelial cells infected with the PR/8/NS1-GFP virus and use GFP<sup>hi</sup> cell as a unique screening marker to identify host factors that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We discovered that APOE affects influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Cell deficiency in APOE conferred substantially increased susceptibility to IAV; mice deficient in APOE manifested more severe lung pathology, increased virus load, and decreased survival rate. Mechanistically, lack of cell-produced APOE results in impaired cell cholesterol homeostasis, enhancing influenza virus attachment. Thus, we identified a previously unrecognized role of APOE in restraining IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study identifies a host factor (APOE) affecting influenza virus infection, focusing on host phenotypes rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza A virus activates cellular Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling to promote viral replication and lung inflammation.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes acute respiratory disease with potential severe and deadly complications. Viral pathogenesis is not only due to the direct cytopathic effect of viral infections but also to the exacerbated host inflammatory responses. Influenza viral infection can activate various host signaling pathways that function to activate or inhibit viral replication. Our previous studies have shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA plays an important role in the replication of influenza viruses in vitro, but its biological roles and functional mechanisms in influenza viral infection have not been characterized. Here we show that IAV infection strongly activates TrkA in vitro and in vivo. Using a chemical-genetic approach to specifically control TrkA kinase activity through a small molecule compound 1NMPP1 in a TrkA knock-in (TrkA KI) mouse model, we show that 1NMPP1-mediated TrkA inhibition completely protected mice from a lethal IAV infection by significantly reducing viral loads and lung inflammation. Using primary lung cells isolated from the TrkA KI mice, we show that specific TrkA inhibition reduced IAV viral RNA synthesis in airway epithelial cells (AECs) but not in alveolar macrophages (AMs). Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the cell-type-specific role of TrkA in viral RNA synthesis, and identified distinct gene expression patterns under the TrkA regulation in IAV-infected AECs and AMs. Among the TrkA-activated targets are various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL6, IL-1β, IFNs, CCL-5, and CXCL9, supporting the role of TrkA in mediating lung inflammation. Indeed, while TrkA inhibitor 1NMPP1 administered after the peak of IAV replication had no effect on viral load, it was able to decrease lung inflammation and provided partial protection in mice. Taken together, our results have demonstrated for the first time an important biological role of TrkA signaling in IAV infection, identified its cell-type-specific contribution to viral replication, and revealed its functional mechanism in virus-induced lung inflammation. This study suggests TrkA as a novel host target for therapeutic development against influenza viral disease.

One of the major drivers of this seasonal variation is thought to be the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, resulting from the accumulation of mutations in viral surface proteins. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between the genetic drift of seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) and the epidemiological severity of seasonal epidemics within a Canadian context. We obtained hemagglutinin protein sequences collected in Canada between the 2006/2007 and 2019/2020 flu seasons from GISAID and calculated Hamming distances in a sequence-based approach to estimating inter-seasonal antigenic differences. We also gathered epidemiological data on cases, hospitalizations and deaths from national surveillance systems and other official sources, as well as vaccine effectiveness estimates to address potential effect modification. These aggregate measures of disease severity were integrated into a single seasonal severity index. We performed linear regressions of our severity index with respect to the inter-seasonal antigenic distances, controlling for vaccine effectiveness. We did not find any evidence of a statistical relationship between antigenic distance and seasonal influenza severity in Canada. Future studies may need to account for additional factors, such as co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, population imprinting, cohort effects and environmental parameters, which may drive seasonal influenza severity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates antigenic drift and epidemiological severity at a population level without explicit links between specific viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: TREX (transcription/export)-NP complex exerts a dual effect on regulating polymerase activity and replication of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses effectively hijack the intracellular "resources" to complete transcription and replication, which involve extensive interactions between the viral and host proteins. Herein, we screened the host factors, which belong to DExD/H-box protein family members, RNA-binding proteins or mitochondrial anchoring proteins, to investigate their effects on polymerase activity. We observed DDX39B and DDX39A, DEAD-box RNA-Helicases, exert a dual effect on regulating polymerase activity and replication of influenza A viruses. We further revealed that DDX39B and DDX39A interact with viral NP and NS1 proteins. Interestingly, the viral NP proteins could reverse the inhibitory effect of excess DDX39B or DDX39A on polymerase activity. Mechanistically, the TREX complex subunits, THOC1, THOC4 and CIP29, were recruited to DDX39B-DDX39A-NP complex in an ATP-dependent manner, via the interaction with DDX39B or DDX39A, followed by excess TREX-NP complexes interfere with the normal oligomerization state of NP depending on the ratio between the viral and host proteins. On the other hand, the TREX complex, an evolutionarily conserved protein complex, is responsible for the integration of several mRNA processing steps to export viral mRNA. Knockdown of TREX complex subunits significantly down-regulated viral titers and protein levels, accompanied by retention of viral mRNA in the nucleus. Taken together, screening the host factors that regulate the replication of influenza virus advances our understanding of viral pathogenesis and our findings point out a previously unclear mechanism of TREX complex function.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host factors regulating polymerase activity and replication of influenza A virus, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: RNA Sequencing Demonstrates That Circular RNA Regulates Avian Influenza Virus Replication in Human Cells.
Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in diverse biological processes. Avian influenza virus (AIV) can cross the species barrier to infect humans. Here, we employed RNA sequencing technology to profile circRNA, microRNA, and mRNA expression in human lung carcinoma cells in response to AIV or human influenza A virus (IAV) infection at viral replication. The analysis revealed that the expression of 475 common circRNAs were significantly regulated. The 381 and 1163 up-regulated circRNAs were induced by AIV at 8 and 16 h, respectively. Subsequently, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were also conducted for the AIV-specific up-regulated circRNAs. Moreover, the circRNAs were characterized, of which six were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. We further confirmed that expression of the selected circRNAs only increased following AIV infection. Knocking down the selected circRNAs promoted AIV proliferation, and overexpression of three of the candidate circRNAs restricted AIV replication and proliferation. We further analyzed that AIV-specific up-regulated circRNA mechanisms might function through the ceRNA network to affect the "Endocytosis" pathway and the "Cell cycle process". These data provide the first expression profile of AIV-specific up-regulated circRNAs and shed new light on the pathogenesis of AIV infection. Our findings also suggest that these circRNAs serve an important role in AIV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates circRNA regulation of avian influenza virus replication in human cells, focusing on host RNA expression changes rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Enzymatic independent role of sphingosine kinase 2 in regulating the expression of type I interferon during influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza virus has the ability to circumvent host innate immune system through regulating certain host factors for its effective propagation. However, the detailed mechanism is still not fully understood. Here, we report that a host sphingolipid metabolism-related factor, sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), upregulated during influenza A virus (IAV) infection, promotes IAV infection in an enzymatic independent manner. The enhancement of the virus replication is not abolished in the catalytic-incompetent SPHK2 (G212E) overexpressing cells. Intriguingly, the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) related factor HDAC1 also plays a crucial role in SPHK2-mediated IAV infection. We found that SPHK2 cannot facilitate IAV infection in HDAC1 deficient cells. More importantly, SPHK2 overexpression diminishes the IFN-β promoter activity upon IAV infection, resulting in the suppression of type I IFN signaling. Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR assay revealed that SPHK2 interacts with IFN-β promoter through the binding of demethylase TET3, but not with the other promoters regulated by TET3, such as TGF-β1 and IL6 promoters. The specific regulation of SPHK2 on IFN-β promoter through TET3 can in turn recruit HDAC1 to the IFN-β promoter, enhancing the deacetylation of IFN-β promoter, therefore leading to the inhibition of IFN-β transcription. These findings reveal an enzymatic independent mechanism on host SPHK2, which associates with TET3 and HDAC1 to negatively regulate type I IFN expression and thus facilitates IAV propagation.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study examines host sphingosine kinase 2's role in regulating interferon expression during influenza A infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A Recombinant VSV-Based Bivalent Vaccine Effectively Protects against Both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: COVID-19 and influenza are both highly contagious respiratory diseases that have been serious threats to global public health. It is necessary to develop a bivalent vaccine to control these two infectious diseases simultaneously. In this study, we generated three attenuated replicating recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidates against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. These rVSV-based vaccines coexpress SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike protein (SP) bearing the C-terminal 17 amino acid (aa) deletion (SPΔC) and I742A point mutation, or the SPΔC with a deletion of S2 domain, or the RBD domain, and a tandem repeat harboring four copies of the highly conserved influenza M2 ectodomain (M2e) that fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal immunization studies have shown that these rVSV bivalent vaccines induced efficient humoral and cellular immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 SP and influenza M2 protein, including high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other variant SP-pseudovirus infections. Importantly, immunization of the rVSV bivalent vaccines effectively protected hamsters or mice against the challenges of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and lethal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced respiratory viral loads. Overall, this study provides convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine platform to be used and/or easily adapted to produce new vaccines against new or reemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza A virus infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Given that both COVID-19 and influenza are preferably transmitted through respiratory droplets during the same seasons, it is highly advantageous to develop a bivalent vaccine that could simultaneously protect against both COVID-19 and influenza. In this study, we generated the attenuated replicating recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidates that target both spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 Delta variant and the conserved influenza M2 domain. Importantly, these vaccine candidates effectively protected hamsters or mice against the challenges of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and lethal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced respiratory viral loads.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development and efficacy of a bivalent vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, but does not analyze viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Co-circulation of coronavirus and avian influenza virus in wild birds in Shanghai (2020-2021).
Abstract: Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses has been reported worldwide in humans. Wild birds are natural reservoir hosts for coronaviruses (CoVs) and avian influenza viruses (AIVs). It is unknown whether co-infection with these two types of viruses occurs in wild birds. In this study, the prevalence of co-infection with CoV and AIV in wild birds in Shanghai, China during 2020-2021 was investigated by detecting these viruses in cloacal, tracheal, and faecal samples. Results showed that the overall rate of samples positive for both CoV and AIV was 3.3% (82/2510; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6%-4.0%), and that was mainly from Anseriformes. In CoV-positive samples, 38.9% (82/211; 95% CI: 32.5%-45.6%) of them had both CoVs and AIVs, whereas only 26.9% (82/305; 95% CI: 22.2%-32.1%) of AIV-positive samples had both CoVs and AIVs. These results suggest that CoV infection in wild birds renders them more susceptible to AIV infection. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences of CoVs revealed that gamma-CoVs mainly cluster with duck CoVs and that delta-CoVs are more diversified and cluster with those of various wild birds. Continual surveillance is necessity to monitor the transmission and evolution of co-infection of these two types of viruses in their natural hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: This surveillance study reports co-circulation and co-infection rates of coronavirus and avian influenza virus in wild birds, without explicit genotype-phenotype analyses.

Title: Simulating the Commercial Implementation of Gene-Editing for Influenza A Virus Resistance in Pigs: An Economic and Genetic Analysis.
Abstract: The development of swine Influenza A Virus resistance along with genetic technologies could complement current control measures to help to improve animal welfare standards and the economic efficiency of pig production. We have created a simulation model to assess the genetic and economic implications of various gene-editing methods that could be implemented in a commercial, multi-tiered swine breeding system. Our results demonstrate the length of the gene-editing program was negatively associated with genetic progress in commercial pigs and that the time required to reach fixation of resistance alleles was reduced if the efficiency of gene-editing is greater. The simulations included the resistance conferred in a digenic model, the inclusion of genetic mosaicism in progeny, and the effects of selection accuracy. In all scenarios, the level of mosaicism had a greater effect on the time required to reach resistance allele fixation and the genetic progress of the herd than gene-editing efficiency and zygote survival. The economic analysis highlights that selection accuracy will not affect the duration of gene-editing and the investment required compared to the effects of gene-editing-associated mosaicism and the swine Influenza A Virus control strategy on farms. These modelling results provide novel insights into the economic and genetic implications of targeting two genes in a commercial pig gene-editing program and the effects of selection accuracy and mosaicism.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models gene-editing for influenza A virus resistance in pigs focusing on genetic and economic implications, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: 3D <i>Ex vivo</i> tissue platforms to investigate the early phases of influenza a virus- and SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory diseases.
Abstract: Pandemic outbreaks of viruses such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 are associated with high morbidity and mortality and thus pose a massive threat to global health and economics. Physiologically relevant models are needed to study the viral life cycle, describe the pathophysiological consequences of viral infection, and explore possible drug targets and treatment options. While simple cell culture-based models do not reflect the tissue environment and systemic responses, animal models are linked with huge direct and indirect costs and ethical questions. <i>Ex vivo</i> platforms based on tissue explants have been introduced as suitable platforms to bridge the gap between cell culture and animal models. We established a murine lung tissue explant platform for two respiratory viruses, influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2. We observed efficient viral replication, associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines and the induction of an antiviral interferon response, comparable to <i>ex vivo</i> infection in human lung explants. Endolysosomal entry could be confirmed as a potential host target for pharmacological intervention, and the potential repurposing potentials of fluoxetine and interferons for host-directed therapy previously seen <i>in vitro</i> could be recapitulated in the <i>ex vivo</i> model.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes ex vivo tissue platforms to study early phases of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on host responses rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The influenza A virus genome packaging network - complex, flexible and yet unsolved.
Abstract: The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) consists of eight unique viral RNA segments. This genome organization allows genetic reassortment between co-infecting IAV strains, whereby new IAVs with altered genome segment compositions emerge. While it is known that reassortment events can create pandemic IAVs, it remains impossible to anticipate reassortment outcomes with pandemic prospects. Recent research indicates that reassortment is promoted by a viral genome packaging mechanism that delivers the eight genome segments as a supramolecular complex into the virus particle. This finding holds promise of predicting pandemic IAVs by understanding the intermolecular interactions governing this genome packaging mechanism. Here, we critically review the prevailing mechanistic model postulating that IAV genome packaging is orchestrated by a network of intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Although we find supporting evidence, including segment-specific packaging signals and experimentally proposed RNA-RNA interaction networks, this mechanistic model remains debatable due to a current shortage of functionally validated intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. We speculate that identifying such functional intersegmental RNA-RNA contacts might be hampered by limitations of the utilized probing techniques and the inherent complexity of the genome packaging mechanism. Nevertheless, we anticipate that improved probing strategies combined with a mutagenesis-based validation could facilitate their discovery.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing the influenza A virus genome packaging mechanism, highlighting gaps in understanding intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions without explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Modeling SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections and antiviral treatments in human lung epithelial tissue equivalents.
Abstract: There is a critical need for physiologically relevant, robust, and ready-to-use in vitro cellular assay platforms to rapidly model the infectivity of emerging viruses and develop new antiviral treatments. Here we describe the cellular complexity of human alveolar and tracheobronchial air liquid interface (ALI) tissue models during SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Our results showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV effectively infect these ALI tissues, with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting a slower replication peaking at later time-points compared to IAV. We detected tissue-specific chemokine and cytokine storms in response to viral infection, including well-defined biomarkers in severe SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections such as CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-10. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed similar findings to that found in vivo for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including dampened IFN response, increased chemokine induction, and inhibition of MHC Class I presentation not observed for IAV infected tissues. Finally, we demonstrate the pharmacological validity of these ALI tissue models as antiviral drug screening assay platforms, with the potential to be easily adapted to include other cell types and increase the throughput to test relevant pathogens.

Title: ProbeTools: designing hybridization probes for targeted genomic sequencing of diverse and hypervariable viral taxa.
Abstract: Sequencing viruses in many specimens is hindered by excessive background material from hosts, microbiota, and environmental organisms. Consequently, enrichment of target genomic material is necessary for practical high-throughput viral genome sequencing. Hybridization probes are widely used for enrichment in many fields, but their application to viral sequencing faces a major obstacle: it is difficult to design panels of probe oligo sequences that broadly target many viral taxa due to their rapid evolution, extensive diversity, and genetic hypervariability. To address this challenge, we created ProbeTools, a package of bioinformatic tools for generating effective viral capture panels, and for assessing coverage of target sequences by probe panel designs in silico. In this study, we validated ProbeTools by designing a panel of 3600 probes for subtyping the hypervariable haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genome segments of avian-origin influenza A viruses (AIVs). Using in silico assessment of AIV reference sequences and in vitro capture on egg-cultured viral isolates, we demonstrated effective performance by our custom AIV panel and ProbeTools' suitability for challenging viral probe design applications. Based on ProbeTool's in silico analysis, our panel provided broadly inclusive coverage of 14,772 HA and 11,967 NA reference sequences. For each reference sequence, we calculated the percentage of nucleotide positions covered by our panel in silico; 90% of HA and NA references sequences had at least 90.8 and 95.1% of their nucleotide positions covered respectively. We also observed effective in vitro capture on a representative collection of 23 egg-cultured AIVs that included isolates from wild birds, poultry, and humans and representatives from all HA and NA subtypes. Forty-two of forty-six HA and NA segments had over 98.3% of their nucleotide positions significantly enriched by our custom panel. These in vitro results were further used to validate ProbeTools' in silico coverage assessment algorithm; 89.2% of in silico predictions were concordant with in vitro results. ProbeTools generated an effective panel for subtyping AIVs that can be deployed for genomic surveillance, outbreak prevention, and pandemic preparedness. Effective probe design against hypervariable AIV targets also validated ProbeTools' design and coverage assessment algorithms, demonstrating their suitability for other challenging viral capture applications.

Title: Induction of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlates with Reduced Growth of Influenza A Virus in Lungs after RIG-I Agonist Treatment of Ferrets.
Abstract: Intracellular RIG-I receptors represent key innate sensors of RNA virus infection, and RIG-I activation results in the induction of hundreds of host effector genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Synthetic RNA agonists targeting RIG-I have shown promise as antivirals against a broad spectrum of viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), in both <i>in vitro</i> and mouse models of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of a ferret airway epithelial (FRL) cell line with a RIG-I agonist rapidly and potently induced expression of a broad range of ISGs and resulted in potent inhibition of growth of different IAV strains. In ferrets, a single intravenous injection of RIG-I agonist was associated with upregulated ISG expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung tissue, but not in nasal tissues. In a ferret model of viral contact transmission, a single treatment of recipient animals 24 h prior to cohousing with IAV-infected donors did not reduce virus transmission and shedding but did result in reduced lung virus titers 6 days after treatment. A single treatment of the IAV-infected donor animals also resulted in reduced virus titers in the lungs 2 days later. Thus, a single intravenous treatment with RIG-I agonist prior to infection or to ferrets with an established IAV infection can reduce virus growth in the lungs. These findings support further development of RIG-I agonists as effective antiviral treatments to limit the impact of IAV infections, particularly in reducing virus replication in the lower airways. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> RIG-I agonists have shown potential as broad-spectrum antivirals <i>in vitro</i> and in mouse models of infection. However, their antiviral potential has not been reported in outbred animals such as ferrets, which are widely regarded as the gold standard small animal model for human IAV infections. Herein, we demonstrate that RIG-I agonist treatment of a ferret airway cell line resulted in ISG induction and inhibition of a broad range of human influenza viruses. A single intravenous treatment of ferrets also resulted in systemic induction of ISGs, including in lung tissue, and when delivered to animals prior to IAV exposure or to animals with established IAV infection treatment resulted in reduced virus replication in the lungs. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of single RIG-I treatment against IAV in the ferret model and highlight the importance of future studies to optimize treatment regimens and delivery routes to maximize their ability to ameliorate IAV infections.

Reason: The paper focuses on host immune responses to RIG-I agonist treatment and its antiviral effects but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Viral-host interactions during splicing and nuclear export of influenza virus mRNAs.
Abstract: As influenza-A viruses (IAV) replicate in the host cell nucleus, intranuclear pathways are usurped for viral gene expression. The eight genomic viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) segments of IAV are transcribed and two generate viral mRNAs (M and NS) that undergo alternative splicing followed by export from the nucleus. The focus of this review is on viral RNA splicing and nuclear export. Recent mechanistic advances on M and NS splicing show differential regulation by RNA-binding proteins as well as distinct intranuclear localization. After a review of IAV splicing, we will discuss the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, which occur by interacting with specific constituents of the host mRNA export machinery that translocate viral mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex for translation in the cytoplasm.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of viral-host interactions during splicing and nuclear export of influenza mRNAs, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Inhibition of H1N1 Influenza Virus-induced Apoptosis by Ebselen Through ROS-mediated ATM/ATR Signaling Pathways.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses can cause global outbreaks and seasonal pandemics. However, the use of conventional anti-influenza drugs leads to an increase in drug-resistant mutations in influenza viruses worldwide. Therefore, numerous studies have focused on developing effective anti-influenza drugs. It is feasible to treat influenza by targeting influenza-mediated oxidative damage. Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium compound which provides glutathione peroxidase-like activity. It has been shown to play a role in anti-influenza therapy, but the mechanism remains to be further explored. This experiment verified the anti-influenza effect of ebselen. CCK-8 and PCR showed that ebselen had a significant inhibitory effect on virus replication compared with the virus group. In addition, the mechanistic investigations revealed that ebselen could inhibit influenza-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and DNA breakage. At the same time, ebselen significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ATM and ATR and promoted the activation of PARP and Caspase-3. Ebselen, on the other hand, reduced the inflammatory response caused by influenza. These results suggest that ebselen is a promising inhibitor for H1N1.

Title: Influenza Viruses Suitable for Studies in Syrian Hamsters.
Abstract: Several small animal models, including mice, Syrian hamsters, guinea pigs, and ferrets are used to study the pathogenicity, transmissibility, and antigenicity of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. Moreover, animal models are essential for vaccination and challenge studies to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of new vaccines. However, authentic human influenza viruses do not always replicate efficiently in these animal models. Previously, we developed a high-yield A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8-HY) vaccine virus backbone that conferred an increased virus yield to several seasonal influenza vaccines in eukaryotic cells and embryonated chicken eggs. Here, we show that this PR8-HY genetic backbone also increases the replication of several seasonal influenza viruses in Syrian hamsters compared to the authentic viruses. Therefore, the PR8-HY backbone is useful for animal studies to assess the biological properties of influenza viral HA and NA.

Title: Influenza A Virus Infection Reactivates Human Endogenous Retroviruses Associated with Modulation of Antiviral Immunity.
Abstract: Human endogenous retrovirus (HERVs), normally silenced by methylation or mutations, can be reactivated by multiple environmental factors, including infections with exogenous viruses. In this work, we investigated the transcriptional activity of HERVs in human A549 cells infected by two wild-type (PR8M, SC35M) and one mutated (SC35MΔNS1) strains of Influenza A virus (IAVs). We found that the majority of differentially expressed HERVs (DEHERVS) and genes (DEGs) were up-regulated in the infected cells, with the most significantly enriched biological processes associated with the genes differentially expressed exclusively in SC35MΔNS1 being linked to the immune system. Most DEHERVs in PR8M and SC35M are mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposons, while in SC35MΔNS1, more HERV loci from the HERVW9 group were differentially expressed. Furthermore, up-regulated pairs of HERVs and genes in close chromosomal proximity to each other tended to be associated with immune responses, which implies that specific HERV groups might have the potential to trigger specific gene networks and influence host immunological pathways.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates reactivation of endogenous retroviruses and host immune modulation during influenza infection, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Use of the ISU <i>FLU</i>ture multisequence identity tool for rapid interpretation of swine influenza A virus sequences in the United States.
Abstract: Rapid and reliable identification of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genetic clades of an influenza A virus (IAV) sequence from swine can inform control measures and multivalent vaccine composition. Current approaches to genetically characterize HA or NA sequences are based on nucleotide similarity or phylogenetic analyses. Public databases exist to acquire IAV genetic sequences for comparison, but personnel at the diagnostic or production level have difficulty in adequately updating and maintaining relevant sequence datasets for IAV in swine. Further, phylogenetic analyses are time intensive, and inference drawn from these methods is impacted by input sequence data and associated metadata. We describe here the use of the IAV multisequence identity tool as an integrated public webpage located on the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) <i>FLU</i>ture website: https://influenza.cvm.iastate.edu/. The multisequence identity tool uses sequence data derived from IAV-positive cases sequenced at the ISU-VDL, employs a BLAST algorithm that identifies sequences that are genetically similar to submitted query sequences, and presents a tabulation and visualization of the most genetically similar IAV sequence and associated metadata from the <i>FLU</i>ture database. Our tool removes bioinformatic barriers and allows clients, veterinarians, and researchers to rapidly classify and identify IAV sequences similar to their own sequences to augment interpretation of results.

Title: MicroRNA let-7 Suppresses Influenza A Virus Infection by Targeting RPS16 and Enhancing Type I Interferon Response.
Abstract: Given the frequent emergence of drug-resistant influenza virus strains and new highly pathogenic influenza virus strains, there is an urgent need to identify new antiviral drugs and targets. We found that influenza A virus (IAV) infection caused a significant decrease of microRNA let-7 expression in host cells; that overexpression of let-7 increased interferon expression and effectively inhibit IAV infection; and that let-7 targets the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the ribosomal protein 16 (<i>RPS16</i>) gene, decreasing its expression. Knocking down the expression of <i>RPS16</i> increased the expression of type I interferon and inhibited viral replication. The present study uncovered the regulatory effect of let-7b and let-7f on influenza A infection, which is a potential biomarker of IAV infection. In addition, let-7 may be a promising therapeutic agent against influenza A.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host microRNA let-7's role in suppressing influenza A virus infection and host immune response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Proteomic analysis reveals zinc-finger CCHC-type containing protein 3 as a factor inhibiting virus infection by promoting innate signaling.
Abstract: Influenza a virus exploits host machinery to benefit its replication in host cells. Knowledge of host factors reveals the complicated interaction and provides potential targets for antiviral treatment. Here, instead of the traditional proteomic analysis, we employed a 4D label free proteomic method to identify cellular factors in A549 cells treated with avian H9N2 virus. We observed that 425 proteins were upregulated and 502 proteins were downregulated. Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the zinc-finger CCHC-type containing protein 3 (ZCCHC3) levels were markedly induced by H9N2 infection. Transient expression assay showed that ZCCHC3 expression decreased NP protein levels and viral titers, whereas knockdown of ZCCHC3 enhanced viral growth. Specifically, ZCCHC3 promoted the expression of IFN-β, leading to the increased transcription of IFN downstream antiviral factors. Surprisingly, viral NS1 protein was able to antagonize the antiviral effect of ZCCHC3 by downregulating IFN-β. Eventually, we observed that chicken finger CCCH-type containing protein 3, named ZC3H3, could also suppress the replication of H9N2 virus and the coronavirus-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in DF-1 cells. Together, our results showed the cellular proteomic response to H9N2 infection and identified ZCCHC3 as a novel antiviral factor against H9N2 infection, contributing to the understanding of host-virus interaction.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a host protein (ZCCHC3) that inhibits virus infection by promoting innate signaling, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Cholesterol Binds the Amphipathic Helix of IFITM3 and Regulates Antiviral Activity.
Abstract: The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins broadly inhibit the entry of diverse pathogenic viruses, including Influenza A virus (IAV), Zika virus, HIV-1, and SARS coronaviruses by inhibiting virus-cell membrane fusion. IFITM3 was previously shown to disrupt cholesterol trafficking, but the functional relationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol remains unclear. We previously showed that inhibition of IAV entry by IFITM3 is associated with its ability to promote cellular membrane rigidity, and these activities are functionally linked by a shared requirement for the amphipathic helix (AH) found in the intramembrane domain (IMD) of IFITM3. Furthermore, it has been shown that the AH of IFITM3 alters lipid membranes in vitro in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol in more detail. Using a fluorescence-based in vitro binding assay, we found that a peptide derived from the AH of IFITM3 directly interacted with the cholesterol analog, NBD-cholesterol, while other regions of the IFITM3 IMD did not, and native cholesterol competed with this interaction. In addition, recombinant full-length IFITM3 protein also exhibited NBD-cholesterol binding activity. Importantly, previously characterized mutations within the AH of IFITM3 that strongly inhibit antiviral function (F63Q and F67Q) disrupted AH structure in solution, inhibited cholesterol binding in vitro, and restricted bilayer insertion in silico. Our data suggest that direct interactions with cholesterol may contribute to the inhibition of membrane fusion pore formation by IFITM3. These findings may facilitate the design of therapeutic peptides for use in broad-spectrum antiviral therapy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the interaction between IFITM3 protein and cholesterol affecting antiviral activity, focusing on host protein function rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The Host Response to Influenza A Virus Interferes with SARS-CoV-2 Replication during Coinfection.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) represent two highly transmissible airborne pathogens with pandemic capabilities. Although these viruses belong to separate virus families-SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family <i>Coronaviridae</i>, while IAV is a member of the family <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i>-both have shown zoonotic potential, with significant animal reservoirs in species in close contact with humans. The two viruses are similar in their capacity to infect human airways, and coinfections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality have been documented. Here, we investigate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 and influenza H1N1 A/California/04/2009 virus during coinfection. Competition assays <i>in vitro</i> were performed in susceptible cells that were either interferon type I/III (IFN-I/-III) nonresponsive or IFN-I/-III responsive, in addition to an <i>in vivo</i> golden hamster model. We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not interfere with IAV biology <i>in vivo</i>, regardless of timing between the infections. In contrast, we observe a significant loss of SARS-CoV-2 replication following IAV infection. The latter phenotype correlates with increased levels of IFN-I/-III and immune priming that interferes with the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Together, these data suggest that cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV is unlikely to result in increased severity of disease. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The human population now has two circulating respiratory RNA viruses with high pandemic potential, namely, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. As both viruses infect the airways and can result in significant morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that we also understand the consequences of getting coinfected. Here, we demonstrate that the host response to influenza A virus uniquely interferes with SARS-CoV-2 biology although the inverse relationship is not evident. Overall, we find that the host response to both viruses is comparable to that to SARS-CoV-2 infection alone.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host immune response interactions during coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Rapid and universal detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus using a reusable dual-channel optic fiber immunosensor.
Abstract: Establishment of rapid on-site detection technology capable of concurrently detecting SARS-Cov-2 and influenza A virus is urgent to effectively control the epidemic from these two types of important viruses. Accordingly, we developed a reusable dual-channel optical fiber immunosensor (DOFIS), which utilized the evanescent wave-sensing properties and tandem detection mode of the mobile phase, effectively accelerating the detection process such that it can be completed within 10 min. It could detect the nucleoprotein of multiple influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9), as well as the spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants, and could respond to 20 TCID<sub>50</sub> /ml SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> /ml influenza A (A/PR/8/H1N1), presenting lower limit of detection and wider linear range than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The detection results on 26 clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated its specificity (100%) and sensitivity (94%), much higher than the sensitivity of commercial colloidal gold test strip (35%). Particularly, DOFIS might be reused more than 80 times, showing not only cost-saving but also potential in real-time monitoring of the pathogenic viruses. Therefore, this newly-developed DOFIS platform is low cost, simple to operate, and has broad spectrum detection capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and multiple influenza A strains. It may prove suitable for deployment as a rapid on-site screening and surveillance technique for infectious disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development of a dual-channel immunosensor for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, focusing on diagnostic technology rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Distinct airway epithelial immune responses after infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to H1N1.
Abstract: Children are less likely than adults to suffer severe symptoms when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while influenza A H1N1 severity is comparable across ages except for the very young or elderly. Airway epithelial cells play a vital role in the early defence against viruses via their barrier and immune functions. We investigated viral replication and immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected bronchial epithelial cells from healthy paediatric (n = 6; 2.5-5.6 years old) and adult (n = 4; 47-63 years old) subjects and compared cellular responses following infection with SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A H1N1. While infection with either virus triggered robust transcriptional interferon responses, including induction of type I (IFNB1) and type III (IFNL1) interferons, markedly lower levels of interferons and inflammatory proteins (IL-6, IL-8) were released following SARS-CoV-2 compared to H1N1 infection. Only H1N1 infection caused disruption of the epithelial layer. Interestingly, H1N1 infection resulted in sustained upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors FURIN and NRP1. We did not find any differences in the epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between paediatric and adult cells. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 had diminished potential to replicate, affect morphology and evoke immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells compared to H1N1.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares airway epithelial immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 infections, focusing on host responses rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Emergence of circulating influenza A H3N2 viruses with genetic drift in the matrix gene: be alert of false-negative test results.
Abstract: In March 2022, we observed samples with a negative fluorescent signal (60.5%, n = 43) for the influenza A matrix gene and a stronger positive signal for subtype A(H3N2). Forty-three samples were positive in InfA (H3N2) (mean Cq 30.9, range 23.9-35.1), and 26 of the 43 samples were negative in InfA matrix (mean Cq 28.0, range 23.2-30.6). Our multiplex test is a laboratory-developed four-target, four-color influenza A reverse-transcription PCR assay targeting the matrix gene, subtypes A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09. Several samples were negative when retested on commercial influenza Point-of-Care assays. As the matrix gene is a stand-alone target in most commercial diagnostic assays, we caution against false-negative subtype A test results.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports on genetic drift in the influenza A H3N2 matrix gene affecting diagnostic test results, focusing on detection issues rather than explicit genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Generation, Characterization, and Applications of Influenza A Reporter Viruses.
Abstract: Secondary experimental procedures such as immunostaining have been utilized to study wild-type influenza A viruses (IAV) but are inadequate to rapidly determine the virus in infected cells or for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of antivirals or neutralizing antibodies. Reverse genetics approaches have allowed the generation of recombinant IAV expressing bioluminescent (BL) reporters or fluorescent proteins (FPs). These approaches can easily track viral infections in cultured cells and in validated animal models of infection using in vivo imaging systems (IVIS). Here, we describe the experimental procedures to generate recombinant monomeric (m)Cherry-expressing influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8-mCherry) H1N1 by altering the non-structural (NS) vRNA segment and its use in mCherry-based microneutralization assays to assess antivirals and neutralizing antibodies. The experimental procedures could be used for the generation of other recombinant influenza virus types (e.g., influenza B) or IAV subtypes (e.g., H3N2) expressing mCherry or other BL reporters or FPs from the NS or other vRNA segment. These recombinant reporter-expressing viruses represent an excellent toolbox for the identification of prophylactics or therapeutics for the treatment of influenza viral infections in HTS settings as well as to study different aspects related with the biology of influenza viruses and/or its interaction with the host.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on generating and using reporter influenza A viruses for tracking infection and antiviral screening, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Synthesis of Pyrimidine Conjugates with 4-(6-Amino-hexanoyl)-7,8-difluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2<i>H</i>-[1,4]benzoxazine and Evaluation of Their Antiviral Activity.
Abstract: A series of pyrimidine conjugates containing a fragment of racemic 7,8-difluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2<i>H</i>-[1,4]benzoxazine and its (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer attached via a 6-aminohexanoyl fragment were synthesized by the reaction of nucleophilic substitution of chlorine in various chloropyrimidines. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data. Enantiomeric purity of optically active derivatives was confirmed by chiral HPLC. Antiviral evaluation of the synthesized compounds has shown that the replacement of purine with a pyrimidine fragment leads to a decrease in the anti-herpesvirus activity compared to the lead compound, purine conjugate. The studied compounds did not exhibit significant activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus.

Title: Detection of respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples using next-generation sequencing: A literature review of recent advances and potential for routine clinical use.
Abstract: Acute respiratory infection is the third most frequent cause of mortality worldwide, causing over 4.25 million deaths annually. Although most diagnosed acute respiratory infections are thought to be of viral origin, the aetiology often remains unclear. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionised the field of virus discovery and identification, particularly in the detection of unknown respiratory viruses. We systematically reviewed the application of NGS technologies for detecting respiratory viruses from clinical samples and outline potential barriers to the routine clinical introduction of NGS. The five databases searched for studies published in English from 01 January 2010 to 01 February 2021, which led to the inclusion of 52 studies. A total of 14 different models of NGS platforms were summarised from included studies. Among these models, second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina sequencers) were used in the majority of studies (41/52, 79%). Moreover, NGS platforms have proven successful in detecting a variety of respiratory viruses, including influenza A/B viruses (9/52, 17%), SARS-CoV-2 (21/52, 40%), parainfluenza virus (3/52, 6%), respiratory syncytial virus (1/52, 2%), human metapneumovirus (2/52, 4%), or a viral panel including other respiratory viruses (16/52, 31%). The review of NGS technologies used in previous studies indicates the advantages of NGS technologies in novel virus detection, virus typing, mutation identification, and infection cluster assessment. Although there remain some technical and ethical challenges associated with NGS use in clinical laboratories, NGS is a promising future tool to improve understanding of respiratory viruses and provide a more accurate diagnosis with simultaneous virus characterisation.

Title: Tollip Inhibits IL-33 Release and Inflammation in Influenza A Virus-Infected Mouse Airways.
Abstract: Respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection continues to pose significant challenges in healthcare of human diseases including asthma. IAV infection in mice was shown to increase IL-33, a key cytokine in driving airway inflammation in asthma, but how IL-33 is regulated during viral infection remains unclear. We previously found that a genetic mutation in Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) was linked to less airway epithelial Tollip expression, increased neutrophil chemokines, and lower lung function in asthma patients. As Tollip is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial stress may contribute to extracellular ATP release and IL-33 secretion, we hypothesized that Tollip downregulates IL-33 secretion via inhibiting ATP release during IAV infection. Wild-type and Tollip knockout (KO) mice were infected with IAV and treated with either an ATP converter apyrase or an IL-33 decoy receptor soluble ST2 (sST2). KO mice significantly lost more body weight and had increased extracellular ATP, IL-33 release, and neutrophilic inflammation. Apyrase treatment reduced extracellular ATP levels, IL-33 release, and neutrophilic inflammation in Tollip KO mice. Excessive lung neutrophilic inflammation in IAV-infected Tollip KO mice was reduced by sST2, which was coupled with less IL-33 release. Our data suggest that Tollip inhibits IAV infection, potentially by inhibiting extracellular ATP release and reducing IL-33 activation and lung inflammation. In addition, sST2 may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to mitigate respiratory viral infection in human subjects with Tollip deficiency.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host protein Tollip's role in regulating inflammation during influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Interferon-mediated repression of miR-324-5p potentiates necroptosis to facilitate antiviral defense.
Abstract: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) is the terminal effector of necroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis. Optimal activation of necroptosis, which eliminates infected cells, is critical for antiviral host defense. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of genes involved in various biological and pathological processes. However, the roles of miRNAs in necroptosis-associated host defense remain largely unknown. We screened a library of miRNAs and identified miR-324-5p as the most effective suppressor of necroptosis. MiR-324-5p downregulates human MLKL expression by specifically targeting the 3'UTR in a seed region-independent manner. In response to interferons (IFNs), miR-324-5p is downregulated via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which removes the posttranscriptional suppression of MLKL mRNA and facilitates the activation of necroptosis. In influenza A virus (IAV)-infected human primary macrophages, IFNs are induced, leading to the downregulation of miR-324-5p. MiR-324-5p overexpression attenuates IAV-associated necroptosis and enhances viral replication, whereas deletion of miR-324-5p potentiates necroptosis and suppresses viral replication. Hence, miR-324-5p negatively regulates necroptosis by manipulating MLKL expression, and its downregulation by IFNs orchestrates optimal activation of necroptosis in host antiviral defense.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host miRNA regulation of necroptosis and antiviral defense, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The protective effect of Tilia amurensis honey on influenza A virus infection through stimulation of interferon-mediated IFITM3 signaling.
Abstract: Recently, attention has focused on the prevention and treatment of respiratory viruses including influenza viruses. We evaluated the antiviral effect of Tilia amurensis honey (TH) against influenza A virus in murine macrophages. Influenza A virus infection was reduced following pretreatment with TH. Pretreatment of murine macrophages with TH increased the production and secretion of type-1 interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines and increased phosphorylation of the type-1 IFN-related proteins, TANK-binding kinase (TBK), and STAT. Moreover, TH increased the expression of IFN-stimulating genes and increased the expression of IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM3), a protein that interferes with virus replication and entry. Taken together, these findings suggest that TH suppresses influenza A virus infection by regulating the innate immune response in macrophages. This supports the development of preventive and therapeutic agents for influenza A virus and enhances the economic value of TH.

Title: Swine influenza virus triggers ferroptosis in A549 cells to enhance virus replication.
Abstract: Recently, Influenza A virus (IAV) has been shown to activate several programmed cell death pathways that play essential roles in host defense. Indeed, cell death caused by viral infection may be mediated by a mixed pattern of cell death instead of a certain single mode. Ferroptosis is a novel form of regulated cell death (RCD) that is mainly mediated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Based on the proteomic data, we wondered whether IAV causes ferroptosis in host cells. In this study, a quantitative proteomics approach based on an iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS was used to profile proteins expressed in A549 cells infected with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV). Meanwhile, we measured the intracellular iron content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and lipid peroxidation in response to SIV infection. Finally, a drug experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of ferroptosis on modulating SIV survival. The bioinformatics analysis revealed several proteins closely relevant to iron homeostasis and transport, and the ferroptosis signaling pathway are highly enriched in response to SIV infection. In our experiment, aberrant expression of iron-binding proteins disrupted labile iron uptake and storage after SIV infection. Meanwhile, SIV infection inhibited system the Xc<sup>-</sup>/GPX4 axis resulting in GSH depletion and the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products. Notably, cell death caused by SIV as a result of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation can be partially rescued by ferroptosis inhibitor. Additionally, blockade of the ferroptotic pathway by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) treatment decreased viral titers and inflammatory response. This study revealed a new mode of cell death induced by IAV infection, and our findings might improve the understanding of the underlying mechanism involved in the interaction of virus and host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates ferroptosis induced by swine influenza virus infection and its effect on viral replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: SATB1 ensures appropriate transcriptional programs within naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.
Abstract: Special AT-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a chromatin-binding protein that has been shown to be a key regulator of T-cell development and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell fate decisions and function. The underlying function for SATB1 in peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation processes is largely unknown. To address this, we examined SATB1-binding patterns in naïve and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrating that SATB1 binds to noncoding regulatory elements linked to T-cell lineage-specific gene programs, particularly in naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We then assessed SATB1 function using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutant mice that exhibit a point mutation in the SATB1 DNA-binding domain (termed Satb1<sup>m1Anu/m1Anu</sup> ). Satb1<sup>m1Anu/m1Anu</sup> mice exhibit diminished SATB1-binding, naïve, Satb1<sup>m1Anu/m1Anu</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibiting transcriptional and phenotypic characteristics reminiscent of effector T cells. Upon activation, the transcriptional signatures of Satb1<sup>m1Anu/m1Anu</sup> and wild-type effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells converged. While there were no overt differences, primary respiratory infection of Satb1<sup>m1Anu/m1Anu</sup> mice with influenza A virus (IAV) resulted in a decreased proportion and number of IAV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells recruited to the infected lung when compared with wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest that SATB1 has a major role in an appropriate transcriptional state within naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and ensures appropriate CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell effector gene expression upon activation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the role of SATB1 in CD8+ T cells and its effect on immune response to influenza A virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Membrane-Tethered Mucin 1 Is Stimulated by Interferon and Virus Infection in Multiple Cell Types and Inhibits Influenza A Virus Infection in Human Airway Epithelium.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human population. Tethered mucin 1 (MUC1) is highly expressed in airway epithelium, the primary site of IAV replication, and also by other cell types that influence IAV infection, including macrophages. MUC1 has the potential to influence infection dynamics through physical interactions and/or signaling activity, yet MUC1 modulation and its impact during viral pathogenesis remain unclear. Thus, we investigated MUC1-IAV interactions in an <i>in vitro</i> model of human airway epithelium (HAE). Our data indicate that a recombinant IAV hemagglutinin (H3) and H3N2 virus can bind endogenous HAE MUC1. Notably, infection of HAE with H1N1 or H3N2 IAV strains does not trigger MUC1 shedding but instead stimulates an increase in cell-associated MUC1 protein. We observed a similar increase after type I or III interferon (IFN) stimulation; however, inhibition of IFN signaling during H1N1 infection only partially abrogated this increase, indicating that multiple soluble factors contribute to MUC1 upregulation during the antiviral response. In addition to HAE, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages also upregulated MUC1 protein in response to IFN treatment and conditioned media from IAV-infected HAE. Then, to determine the impact of MUC1 on IAV pathogenesis, we developed HAE genetically depleted of MUC1 and found that MUC1 knockout cultures exhibited enhanced viral growth compared to control cultures for several IAV strains. Together, our data support a model whereby MUC1 inhibits productive uptake of IAV in HAE. Infection then stimulates MUC1 expression on multiple cell types through IFN-dependent and -independent mechanisms that further impact infection dynamics. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus (IAV) targets airway epithelial cells for infection. Large, heavily glycosylated molecules known as tethered mucins extend from the airway epithelial cell surface and may physically restrict pathogen access to underlying cells. Additionally, tethered mucin 1 (MUC1) can be differentially phosphorylated based on external stimuli and can influence inflammation. Given MUC1's multifunctional capability, we sought to define its role during IAV infection. Here, we demonstrate that IAV directly interacts with MUC1 in a physiologically relevant model of human airway epithelium (HAE) and find that MUC1 protein expression is elevated throughout the epithelium and in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages in response to antiviral signals produced during infection. Using CRISPR/Cas9-modified HAE, we demonstrated more efficient IAV infection when MUC1 is genetically ablated. Our data suggest that MUC1 physically restricts IAV uptake and represents a dynamic component of the host response that acts to inhibit viral spread, yielding new insight into mucin-mediated antiviral defense.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of host MUC1 protein in inhibiting influenza A virus infection, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or their phenotypic effects.

Title: Development of a Rapid Fluorescent Diagnostic System for Early Detection of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 Clade 2.3.4.4 Viruses in Chicken Stool.
Abstract: Rapid diagnosis is essential for the control and prevention of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). However, highly sensitive and rapid diagnostic systems have shown limited performance due to specific antibody scarcity. In this study, two novel specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses were developed by using an immunogen from a reversed genetic influenza virus (RGV). These mAbs were combined with fluorescence europium nanoparticles and an optimized lysis buffer, which were further used for developing a fluorescent immunochromatographic rapid strip test (FICT) for early detection of H5Nx influenza viruses on chicken stool samples. The result indicates that the limit of detection (LoD) of the developed FICT was 40 HAU/mL for detection of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4b in spiked chicken stool samples, which corresponded to 4.78 × 10<sup>4</sup> RNA copies as obtained from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An experimental challenge of chicken with H5N6 HPAIV is lethal for chicken three days post-infection (DPI). Interestingly, our FICT could detect H5N6 in stool samples at 2 DPI earlier, with 100% relative sensitivity in comparison with RT-PCR, and it showed 50% higher sensitivity than the traditional colloidal gold-based rapid diagnostic test using the same mAbs pair. In conclusion, our rapid diagnostic method can be utilized for the early detection of H5Nx 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs in avian fecal samples from poultry farms or for influenza surveillance in wild migratory birds.

Title: Comparison of CpG- and UpA-mediated restriction of RNA virus replication in mammalian and avian cells and investigation of potential ZAP-mediated shaping of host transcriptome compositions.
Abstract: The ability of zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) to recognize and respond to RNA virus sequences with elevated frequencies of CpG dinucleotides has been proposed as a functional part of the vertebrate innate immune antiviral response. It has been further proposed that ZAP activity shapes compositions of cytoplasmic mRNA sequences to avoid self-recognition, particularly mRNAs for interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expressed during the antiviral state. We investigated whether restriction of the replication of mutants of influenza A virus (IAV) and the echovirus 7 (E7) replicon with high CpG and UpA frequencies varied in different species of mammals and birds. Cell lines from different bird orders showed substantial variability in restriction of CpG-high mutants of IAV and E7 replicons, whereas none restricted UpA-high mutants, in marked contrast to universal restriction of both mutants in mammalian cells. Dinucleotide representation in ISGs and IFN genes was compared with those of cellular transcriptomes to determine whether potential differences in inferred ZAP activity between species shaped dinucleotide compositions of highly expressed genes during the antiviral state. While mammalian type 1 IFN genes typically showed often profound suppression of CpG and UpA frequencies, there was no oversuppression of either in ISGs in any species, irrespective of their ability to restrict CpG- or UpA-high mutants. Similarly, genome sequences of mammalian and avian RNA viruses were compositionally equivalent, as were IAV strains recovered from ducks, chickens and humans. Overall, we found no evidence for host variability in inferred ZAP function shaping host or viral transcriptome compositions.

Title: Transchromosomic bovines-derived broadly neutralizing antibodies as potent biotherapeutics to counter important emerging viral pathogens with a special focus on SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, HIV-1, and influenza A virus.
Abstract: Historically, passive immunotherapy is an approved approach for protecting and treating humans against various diseases when other alternative therapeutic options are unavailable. Human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) can be made from convalescent human donor serum, although it is considered limited due to pandemics and the urgent requirement. Additionally, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) could be generated from animals, but they may cause severe immunoreactivity and, once "humanized," may have lower neutralization efficiency. Transchromosomic bovines (TcBs) have been developed to address these concerns by creating robust neutralizing hpAbs, which are useful in preventing and/or curing human infections in response to hyperimmunization with vaccines holding adjuvants and/or immune stimulators over an extensive period. Unlike other animal-derived pAbs, potent hpAbs could be promptly produced from TcB in large amounts to assist against an outbreak scenario. Some of these highly efficacious TcB-derived antibodies have already neutralized and blocked diseases in clinical studies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has numerous variants classified into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring. Although these variants possess different mutations, such as N501Y, E484K, K417N, K417T, L452R, T478K, and P681R, SAB-185 has shown broad neutralizing activity against VOCs, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, and VOIs, such as Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda variants. This article highlights recent developments in the field of bovine-derived biotherapeutics, which are seen as a practical platform for developing safe and effective antivirals with broad activity, particularly considering emerging viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Zika, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and influenza A virus. Antibodies in the bovine serum or colostrum, which have been proved to be more protective than their human counterparts, are also reviewed.

Title: Rosmarinic acid interferes with influenza virus A entry and replication by decreasing GSK3β and phosphorylated AKT expression levels.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the in vivo activity of rosmarinic acid (RA) - a phytochemical with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties - against influenza virus (IAV). An antibody-based kinase array and different in vitro functional assays were also applied to identify the mechanistic underpinnings by which RA may exert its anti-IAV activity. We initially examined the potential efficacy of RA using an in vivo mouse model. A time-of-addition assay and an antibody-based kinase array were subsequently applied to investigate mechanism-of-action targets for RA. The hemagglutination inhibition assay, neuraminidase inhibition assay, and cellular entry assay were also performed. RA increased survival and prevented body weight loss in IAV-infected mice. In vitro experiments revealed that RA inhibited different IAV viruses - including oseltamivir-resistant strains. From a mechanistic point of view, RA downregulated the GSK3β and Akt signaling pathways - which are known to facilitate IAV entry and replication into host cells. RA has promising preclinical efficacy against IAV, primarily by interfering with the GSK3β and Akt signaling pathways.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N8) Clade 2.3.4.4b Virus in Dust Samples from Poultry Farms, France, 2021.
Abstract: Avian influenza A(H5N8) virus has caused major epizootics in Europe since 2016. We conducted virologic analysis of aerosol and dust collected on poultry farms in France during 2020-2021. Our results suggest dust contributes to viral dispersal, even early in an outbreak, and could be a valuable surveillance tool.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes viral presence in dust samples from poultry farms, focusing on environmental surveillance rather than linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cross-reactive immunity potentially drives global oscillation and opposed alternation patterns of seasonal influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Several human pathogens exhibit distinct patterns of seasonality and circulate as pairs. For instance, influenza A virus subtypes oscillate and peak during winter seasons of the world's temperate climate zones. Alternation of dominant strains in successive influenza seasons makes epidemic forecasting a major challenge. From the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic we enrolled influenza A virus infected patients (n = 2980) in a global prospective clinical study. Complete hemagglutinin sequences were obtained from 1078 A/H1N1 and 1033 A/H3N2 viruses. We used phylodynamics to construct high resolution spatio-temporal phylogenetic hemagglutinin trees and estimated global influenza A effective reproductive numbers (R) over time (2009-2013). We demonstrate that R oscillates around R = 1 with a clear opposed alternation pattern between phases of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. Moreover, we find a similar alternation pattern for the number of global viral spread between the sampled geographical locations. Both observations suggest a between-strain competition for susceptible hosts on a global level. Extrinsic factors that affect person-to-person transmission are a major driver of influenza seasonality. The data presented here indicate that cross-reactive host immunity is also a key intrinsic driver of influenza seasonality, which determines the influenza A virus strain at the onset of each epidemic season.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiological and immunological dynamics of influenza A virus subtypes and host immunity but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetically Diverse Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1/H5N8) Viruses among Wild Waterfowl and Domestic Poultry, Japan, 2021.
Abstract: Genetic analyses of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 subtype viruses isolated from the Izumi Plain, Japan, revealed cocirculation of 2 genetic groups of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses among migratory waterfowl. Our findings demonstrate that both continuous surveillance and timely information sharing of avian influenza viruses are valuable for rapid risk assessment.

Title: Clinical and phylogenetic influenza dynamics for the 2019-20 season in the global influenza hospital surveillance network (GIHSN) - Pilot study.
Abstract: The Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) has operated with the aim of investigating epidemiological and clinical factors related to severe influenza-related hospitalisations. A common GIHSN core protocol for prospective patient enrolment was implemented. Hospital personnel completed a standardized questionnaire regarding the included patients' medical history, compiled a hospitalisation summary, collected an upper respiratory swab sample for laboratory diagnosis, and genome sequencing was performed for a subset of samples. Patient data were compared according to influenza subtype, lineage, and phylogenetic groups using the Fisher's exact test. From September 2019 to May 2020, 8791 patients aged ≥5 years were included. Among them, 3021 (34.4%) had a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominated the season among all age groups, while the B/Victoria-like lineage accounted for over half of the infections among younger age groups (5-49 years). Sequencing of the hemagglutinin segment was possible for 623 samples and revealed an influenza A and B clade frequency among severe influenza hospitalisations similar to other medically attended surveillance networks, such as the WHO GISRS. No phylogenetic clustering was observed among hemagglutinin substitutions depending on the administration of supplemental oxygen or vaccine failure. The GIHSN confirms its ability as an international hospital-based active surveillance network to provide valuable information on influenza infection dynamics in hospital settings. Increasing the number of participating sites and compiling more complete data, such as genome sequencing, will allow the exploration of associations between viral factors, vaccine protection, and disease severity.

Title: Risk profile of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus infections in farms in southern Vietnam.
Abstract: The impact of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) has been confirmed mainly in farms. Unlike apparent losses caused by the high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI), the LPAI impact has been hardly evaluated due to underestimating its spread and damage. In 2019, a questionnaire study was conducted in southern Vietnam to identify the specific risk factors of LPAI virus (LPAIV) circulation and to find associations between husbandry activities and LPAI prevalence. A multilevel regression analysis indicated that keeping Muscovy ducks during farming contributed to LPAIV positivity [Odds ratio=208.2 (95% confidence interval: 13.4-1.1 × 10<sup>4</sup>)]. In cluster analysis, farmers willing to report avian influenza (AI) events and who agreed with the local AI control policy had a slightly lower risk for LPAIV infection although there was no significance in the correlation between farmer characteristics and LPAI occurrence. These findings indicated that keeping Muscovy ducks without appropriate countermeasures might increase the risk of LPAIV infection. Furthermore, specific control measures at the local level are effective for LPAIV circulation, and the improvement of knowledge about biosecurity and attitude contributes to reducing LPAI damage.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies risk factors for LPAI virus infections in farms but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Roles of Ubiquitination in Pathogenesis of Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: The ubiquitin system denotes a potent post-translational modification machinery that is capable of activation or deactivation of target proteins through reversible linkage of a single ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains. Ubiquitination regulates major cellular functions such as protein degradation, trafficking and signaling pathways, innate immune response, antiviral defense, and virus replication. The RNA sensor RIG-I ubiquitination is specifically induced by influenza A virus (IAV) to activate type I IFN production. Influenza virus modulates the activity of major antiviral proteins in the host cell to complete its full life cycle. Its structural and non-structural proteins, matrix proteins and the polymerase complex can regulate host immunity and antiviral response. The polymerase PB1-F2 of mutated 1918 IAV, adapts a novel IFN antagonist function by sending the DDX3 into proteasomal degradation. Ultimately the fate of virus is determined by the outcome of interplay between viral components and host antiviral proteins and ubiquitination has a central role in the encounter of virus and its host cell.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on ubiquitination in influenza virus pathogenesis and host-virus interactions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Australia as a global sink for the genetic diversity of avian influenza A virus.
Abstract: Most of our understanding of the ecology and evolution of avian influenza A virus (AIV) in wild birds is derived from studies conducted in the northern hemisphere on waterfowl, with a substantial bias towards dabbling ducks. However, relevant environmental conditions and patterns of avian migration and reproduction are substantially different in the southern hemisphere. Through the sequencing and analysis of 333 unique AIV genomes collected from wild birds collected over 15 years we show that Australia is a global sink for AIV diversity and not integrally linked with the Eurasian gene pool. Rather, AIV are infrequently introduced to Australia, followed by decades of isolated circulation and eventual extinction. The number of co-circulating viral lineages varies per subtype. AIV haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes that are rarely identified at duck-centric study sites (H8-12) had more detected introductions and contemporary co-circulating lineages in Australia. Combined with a lack of duck migration beyond the Australian-Papuan region, these findings suggest introductions by long-distance migratory shorebirds. In addition, on the available data we found no evidence of directional or consistent patterns in virus movement across the Australian continent. This feature corresponds to patterns of bird movement, whereby waterfowl have nomadic and erratic rainfall-dependant distributions rather than consistent intra-continental migratory routes. Finally, we detected high levels of virus gene segment reassortment, with a high diversity of AIV genome constellations across years and locations. These data, in addition to those from other studies in Africa and South America, clearly show that patterns of AIV dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere are distinct from those in the temperate north.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses genetic diversity and ecology of avian influenza virus in Australia but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Virus-host interaction networks as new antiviral drug targets for IAV and SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Currently, SARS-CoV-2, especially the Omicron strain, is ravaging the world and even co-infecting human beings with IAV, which is a serious threat to human public health. As of yet, no specific antiviral drug has been discovered for SARS-CoV-2. This requires deeper understandings of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-host interaction, to explore antiviral drug targets and provide theoretical basis for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. This article discussed IAV, which has been comprehensively studied and is expected to provide the most important reference value for the SARS-CoV-2 study apart from members of the Coronaviridae family. We wish to establish a theoretical system for the studies on virus-host interaction. Previous studies have shown that host PRRs recognize RNAs of IAV or SARS-CoV-2 and then activate innate immune signaling pathways to induce the expression of host restriction factors, such as ISGs, to ultimately inhibit viral replication. Meanwhile, viruses have also evolved various regulatory mechanisms to antagonize host innate immunity at transcriptional, translational, post-translational modification, and epigenetic levels. Besides, viruses can hijack supportive host factors for their replication. Notably, the race between host antiviral innate immunity and viral antagonism of host innate immunity forms virus-host interaction networks. Additionally, the viral replication cycle is co-regulated by proteins, ncRNAs, sugars, lipids, hormones, and inorganic salts. Given this, we updated the mappings of antiviral drug targets based on virus-host interaction networks and proposed an innovative idea that virus-host interaction networks as new antiviral drug targets for IAV and SARS-CoV-2 from the perspectives of viral immunology and systems biology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses virus-host interaction networks and antiviral drug targets but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza antivirals and animal models.
Abstract: Influenza A and B viruses are among the most prominent human respiratory pathogens. About 3-5 million severe cases of influenza are associated with 300 000-650 000 deaths per year globally. Antivirals effective at reducing morbidity and mortality are part of the first line of defense against influenza. FDA-approved antiviral drugs currently include adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI; peramivir, zanamivir, and oseltamivir), and the PA endonuclease inhibitor (baloxavir). Mutations associated with antiviral resistance are common and highlight the need for further improvement and development of novel anti-influenza drugs. A summary is provided for the current knowledge of the approved influenza antivirals and antivirals strategies under evaluation in clinical trials. Preclinical evaluations of novel compounds effective against influenza in different animal models are also discussed.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5Nx) Virus of Clade 2.3.4.4b Emerging in Tibet, China, 2021.
Abstract: H5N8 and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of clade 2.3.4.4b were isolated from dead migratory birds and fecal samples collected in Tibet, China, in May 2021. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the viruses isolated in this study may have spread from wintering or stopover grounds of migratory birds in South Asia. We monitored two disparate clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses in migratory birds in Tibet during their breeding season. The data revealed that breeding grounds may exhibit a potential pooling effect among avian influenza viruses in different migratory populations. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In this study, 15 H5N8 and two H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b were isolated from dead migratory birds and fecal samples in Tibet, China. Isolates of H5N1 virus of clade 2.3.4.4b have been rarely reported in China. Our findings highlight that breeding grounds may exhibit a potential pooling effect among avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in different migratory populations. In addition to intensification of the surveillance of AIVs in migratory birds in Tibet, China, international cooperation should be strengthened.

Title: Role of wild birds in the spread of clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus into South Korea and Japan.
Abstract: H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have caused transboundary epizootics in poultry and wild birds. In 2016, the H5N6 subtype of clade 2.3.4.4e HPAIVs caused multiple outbreaks in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. However, the geographical spread pattern of 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV has not been clearly identified. To better understand the emergence and transmission history of 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV, we investigated the underlying epidemiologic processes associated with this viral spread by performing a Bayesian phylogeography analysis. The results revealed that wild waterfowl played a central role in the transboundary spread of clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV into both endemic and non-endemic countries, causing multiple incursions of the 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV into South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. In our analysis, Guangdong province, China was estimated to be the most probable site where 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIVs emerged prior to the transboundary transmissions. Continued genomic surveillance in both wild birds and poultry would be necessary for monitoring of HPAIV incursions. In addition, enhanced biosecurity would be key to preventing the HPAIV spread by minimizing contact between domestic poultry and wild birds.

Title: Human Organotypic Airway and Lung Organoid Cells of Bronchiolar and Alveolar Differentiation Are Permissive to Infection by Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Virus.
Abstract: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the initiation of unprecedented research efforts to understand the pathogenesis mediated by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More knowledge is needed regarding the cell type-specific cytopathology and its impact on cellular tropism. Furthermore, the impact of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutations on cellular tropism, alternative routes of entry, the impact of co-infections, and virus replication kinetics along the respiratory tract remains to be explored in improved models. Most applied virology models are not well suited to address the remaining questions, as they do not recapitulate the histoarchitecture and cellular composition of human respiratory tissues. The overall aim of this work was to establish from single biopsy specimens, a human adult stem cell-derived organoid model representing the upper respiratory airways and lungs and explore the applicability of this model to study respiratory virus infection. First, we characterized the organoid model with respect to growth pattern and histoarchitecture, cellular composition, and functional characteristics. Next, <i>in situ</i> expression of viral entry receptors, including influenza virus-relevant sialic acids and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were confirmed in organoids of bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation. We further showed successful infection by pseudotype influenza A H7N1 and H5N1 virus, and the ability of the model to support viral replication of influenza A H7N1 virus. Finally, successful infection and replication of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed in the organoids by TCID50 assay and immunostaining to detect intracellular SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid and dsRNA. The prominent syncytia formation in organoid tissues following SARS-CoV-2 infection mimics the findings from infected human tissues <i>in situ</i>. We conclude that the human organotypic model described here may be particularly useful for virology studies to evaluate regional differences in the host response to infection. The model contains the various cell types along the respiratory tract, expresses respiratory virus entry factors, and supports successful infection and replication of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the model may serve as a relevant and reliable tool in virology and aid in pandemic preparedness, and efficient evaluation of antiviral strategies.

Abstract: In this work, a synthetic approach to prepare an example of new class of the derivatives of the closo-decaborate anion with amino acids detached from the boron cluster by pendant group has been proposed and implemented. Compound Na<sub>2</sub>[B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>9</sub>-O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>C(O)-His-OMe] was isolated and characterized.

Title: Syk Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication by Restraining Innate Immunity at the Late Stage of Viral Infection.
Abstract: Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has recently come forth as a critical regulator of innate immune response. Previous studies identify Syk as a key kinase for STAT1 activation at the early stage of influenza A virus (IAV) infection that is involved in initial antiviral immunity. However, the involvement of Syk in host antiviral immunity during the late phase of IAV infection and its effect on pathogenesis of the virus remain unknown. Here, we found through time course studies that Syk restrained antiviral immune response at the late stage of IAV infection, thereby promoting viral replication. Depletion of Syk suppressed IAV replication <i>in vitro</i>, whereas ectopic expression of Syk facilitated viral replication. Moreover, Syk-deficient mice were employed, and we observed that knockout of Syk rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection, as evidenced by a lower degree of lung injury, slower body weight loss, and an increased survival rate of Syk knockout mice challenged with IAV. Furthermore, we revealed that Syk repressed the interferon response at the late stage of viral infection. Loss of Syk potentiated the expression of type I and III interferons in both Syk-depleted cells and mice. Mechanistically, Syk interacted with TBK1 and modulated its phosphorylation status, thereby impeding TBK1 activation and restraining innate immune signaling that governs interferon response. Together, these findings unveil a role of Syk in temporally regulating host antiviral immunity and advance our understanding of complicated mechanisms underlying regulation of innate immunity against viral invasion. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Innate immunity must be tightly controlled to eliminate invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Syk is essential for STAT1 activation at the early stage of IAV infection, which is critical for initial antiviral responses. Surprisingly, here a time course study showed that Syk suppressed innate immunity during late phases of IAV infection and thereby promoted IAV replication. Syk deficiency enhanced the expression of type I and III interferons, inhibited IAV replication, and rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection. Syk impaired innate immune signaling through impeding TBK1 activation. These data reveal that Syk participates in the initiation of antiviral defense against IAV infection and simultaneously contributes to the restriction of innate immunity at the late stage of viral infection, suggesting that Syk serves a dual function in regulating antiviral responses. This finding provides new insights into complicated mechanisms underlying interaction between virus and host immune system.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of host kinase Syk in influenza A virus replication and innate immunity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Secondary Structure of Influenza A Virus Genomic Segment 8 RNA Folded in a Cellular Environment.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) family of viruses. The most recent global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown the major threat that RNA viruses can pose to humanity. In comparison, influenza has an even higher pandemic potential as a result of its high rate of mutations within its relatively short (<13 kbp) genome, as well as its capability to undergo genetic reassortment. In light of this threat, and the fact that RNA structure is connected to a broad range of known biological functions, deeper investigation of viral RNA (vRNA) structures is of high interest. Here, for the first time, we propose a secondary structure for segment 8 vRNA (vRNA8) of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) formed in the presence of cellular and viral components. This structure shows similarities with prior in vitro experiments. Additionally, we determined the location of several well-defined, conserved structural motifs of vRNA8 within IAV strains with possible functionality. These RNA motifs appear to fold independently of regional nucleoprotein (NP)-binding affinity, but a low or uneven distribution of NP in each motif region is noted. This research also highlights several accessible sites for oligonucleotide tools and small molecules in vRNA8 in a cellular environment that might be a target for influenza A virus inhibition on the RNA level.

Title: RUNX1 inhibits the antiviral immune response against influenza A virus through attenuating type I interferon signaling.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are zoonotic, segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses. The rapid mutation of IAVs results in host immune response escape and antiviral drug and vaccine resistance. RUNX1 is a transcription factor that not only plays essential roles in hematopoiesis, but also functions as a regulator in inflammation. However, its role in the innate immunity to IAV infection has not been well studied. To investigate the effects of RUNX1 on IAV infection and explore the mechanisms that RUNX1 uses during IAV infection. We infected the human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and examined RUNX1 expression by Western blot and qRT-PCR. We also knocked down or overexpressed RUNX1 in A549 cells, then evaluated viral replication by Western blot, qRT-PCR, and viral titration. We found RUNX1 expression is induced by IAV H1N1 PR8 infection, but not by poly(I:C) treatment, in the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549. Knockdown of RUNX1 significantly inhibited IAV infection. Conversely, overexpression of RUNX1 efficiently promoted production of progeny viruses. Additionally, RUNX1 knockdown increased IFN-β and ISGs production while RUNX1 overexpression compromised IFN-β and ISGs production upon PR8 infection in A549 cells. We further showed that RUNX1 may attenuate the interferon signaling transduction by hampering the expression of IRF3 and STAT1 during IAV infection. Taken together, we found RUNX1 attenuates type I interferon signaling to facilitate IAV infection in A549 cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the role of host transcription factor RUNX1 in influenza infection and interferon signaling, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Naïve Human Macrophages Are Refractory to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Exhibit a Modest Inflammatory Response Early in Infection.
Abstract: Involvement of macrophages in the SARS-CoV-2-associated cytokine storm, the excessive secretion of inflammatory/anti-viral factors leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, is unclear. In this study, we sought to characterize the interplay between the virus and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). MDM were stimulated with recombinant IFN-α and/or infected with either live or UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or with two reassortant influenza viruses containing external genes from the H1N1 PR8 strain and heterologous internal genes from a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 or a low pathogenic human seasonal H1N1 strain. Virus replication was monitored by qRT-PCR for the <i>E</i> viral gene for SARS-CoV-2 or <i>M</i> gene for influenza and TCID<sub>50</sub> or plaque assay, and cytokine levels were assessed semiquantitatively with qRT-PCR and a proteome cytokine array. We report that MDM are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 whereas both influenza viruses replicated in MDM, albeit abortively. We observed a modest cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 exposed MDM with notable absence of IFN-β induction, which was instead strongly induced by the influenza viruses. Pre-treatment of MDM with IFN-α enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression upon exposure to virus. Together, the findings concur that the hyperinflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not driven by macrophages.

Title: Application of the CRISPR/Cas9 System to Study Regulation Pathways of the Cellular Immune Response to Influenza Virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a respiratory infection that affects millions of people of different age groups and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, host genes, receptors, and other cellular components critical for IAV replication are actively studied. One of the most convenient and accessible genome-editing tools to facilitate these studies is the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This tool allows for regulating the expression of both viral and host cell genes to enhance or impair viral entry and replication. This review considers the effect of the genome editing system on specific target genes in cells (human and chicken) in terms of subsequent changes in the influenza virus life cycle and the efficiency of virus particle production.

Title: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus but Not Respiratory Syncytial Virus Interferes with SARS-CoV-2 Replication during Sequential Infections in Human Nasal Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: The types of interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses are not well-characterized due to the low number of co-infection cases described since the onset of the pandemic. We have evaluated the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 (D614G mutant) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the nasal human airway epithelium (HAE) infected simultaneously or sequentially (24 h apart) with virus combinations. The replication kinetics of each virus were determined by RT-qPCR at different post-infection times. Our results showed that during simultaneous infection, SARS-CoV-2 interferes with RSV-A2 but not with A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. The prior infection of nasal HAE with SARS-CoV-2 reduces the replication kinetics of both respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 replication is decreased by a prior infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 but not with RSV-A2. The pretreatment of nasal HAE with BX795, a TANK-binding kinase 1 inhibitor, partially alleviates the reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during sequential infection with both virus combinations. Thus, a prior infection of nasal HAE with SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the replication kinetics of A(H1N1)pdm09 and RSV-A2, whereas only A(H1N1)pdm09 reduces the subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The mechanism involved in the viral interference between SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 is mediated by the production of interferon.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates viral interference between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza or RSV in human nasal cells, focusing on replication kinetics and interferon, without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Abstract: Both influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza D virus (IDV) are enzootic in pigs. IAV causes approximately 100% morbidity with low mortality, whereas IDV leads to only mild respiratory diseases in pigs. In this study, we performed a series of coinfection experiments in vitro and in vivo to understand how IAV and IDV interact and cause pathogenesis during coinfection. The results showed that IAV inhibited IDV replication when infecting swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs) with IAV 24 or 48 h prior to IDV inoculation and that IDV suppressed IAV replication when IDV preceded IAV inoculation by 48 h. Virus interference was not identified during simultaneous IAV/IDV infections or with 6 h between the two viral infections, regardless of their order. The interference pattern at 24 and 48 h correlated with proinflammatory responses induced by the first infection, which, for IDV, was slower than for IAV by about 24 h. The viruses did not interfere with each other if both infected the cells before proinflammatory responses were induced. Coinfection in pigs further demonstrated that IAV interfered with both viral shedding and virus replication of IDV, especially in the upper respiratory tract. Clinically, coinfection of IDV and IAV did not show significant enhancement of disease pathogenesis, compared with the pigs infected with IAV alone. In summary, this study suggests that interference during coinfection of IAV and IDV is primarily due to the proinflammatory response; therefore, it is dependent on the time between infections and the order of infection. This study facilitates our understanding of virus epidemiology and pathogenesis associated with IAV and IDV coinfection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines proinflammatory responses shaping virus interference during coinfections of influenza A and D viruses, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Heterogeneous Ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) Interacts with the Nucleoprotein of the Influenza a Virus and Impedes Virus Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV), like other viruses, depends on the host cellular machinery for replication and production of progeny. The relationship between a virus and a host is complex, shaped by many spatial and temporal interactions between viral and host proteome, ultimately dictating disease outcome. Therefore, it is imperative to identify host-virus interactions as crucial determinants of disease pathogenies. Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) is an RNA binding protein involved in the life cycle of many DNA and RNA viruses; however, its role in IAV remains undiscovered. Here we report that human hnRNPA1 physically interacts with the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV in mammalian cells at different time points of the viral replication cycle. Temporal distribution studies identify hnRNPA1 and NP co-localize in the same cellular milieu in both nucleus and mitochondria in NP-transfected and IAV-infected mammalian cells. Interestingly, hnRNPA1 influenced NP gene expression and affected viral replication. Most importantly, hnRNPA1 knockdown caused a significant increase in NP expression and enhanced viral replication (93.82%) in IAV infected A549 cells. Conversely, hnRNPA1 overexpression reduced NP expression at the mRNA and protein levels and impeded virus replication by (60.70%), suggesting antagonistic function. Taken together, results from this study demonstrate that cellular hnRNPA1 plays a protective role in the host hitherto unknown and may hold potential as an antiviral target to develop host-based therapeutics against IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host hnRNPA1 interaction with influenza nucleoprotein and its effect on viral replication, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: p21 restricts influenza A virus by perturbing the viral polymerase complex and upregulating type I interferon signaling.
Abstract: Many cellular genes and networks induced in human lung epithelial cells infected with the influenza virus remain uncharacterized. Here, we find that p21 levels are elevated in response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, which is independent of p53. Silencing, pharmacological inhibition or deletion of p21 promotes virus replication in vitro and in vivo, indicating that p21 is an influenza restriction factor. Mechanistically, p21 binds to the C-terminus of IAV polymerase subunit PA and competes with PB1 to limit IAV polymerase activity. Besides, p21 promotes IRF3 activation by blocking K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HO-1 to enhance type I interferons expression. Furthermore, a synthetic p21 peptide (amino acids 36 to 43) significantly inhibits IAV replication in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal that p21 restricts IAV by perturbing the viral polymerase complex and activating the host innate immune response, which may aid the design of desperately needed new antiviral therapeutics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of host factor p21 in restricting influenza A virus by perturbing the viral polymerase complex and upregulating interferon signaling, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: MicroRNA-200c-targeted contactin 1 facilitates the replication of influenza A virus by accelerating the degradation of MAVS.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continuously challenge the poultry industry and human health. Elucidation of the host factors that modulate the IAV lifecycle is vital for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines. In this study, we infected A549 cells with IAVs and found that host protein contactin-1 (CNTN1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, enhanced viral replication. Bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation indicated that the expression of CNTN1 was reduced by microRNA-200c (miR-200c) through directly targeting. We further showed that CNTN1-modulated viral replication in A549 cells is dependent on type I interferon signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CNTN1 specifically interacts with MAVS and promotes its proteasomal degradation by removing its K63-linked ubiquitination. Moreover, we discovered that the deubiquitinase USP25 is recruited by CNTN1 to catalyze the deubiquitination of K63-linked MAVS. Consequently, the CNTN1-induced degradation cascade of MAVS blocked RIG-I-MAVS-mediated interferon signaling, leading to enhanced viral replication. Taken together, our data reveal novel roles of CNTN1 in the type I interferon pathway and regulatory mechanism of IAV replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host protein CNTN1's role in influenza A virus replication and interferon signaling, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: RF-Net 2: fast inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks.
Abstract: A phylogenetic network is a powerful model to represent entangled evolutionary histories with both divergent (speciation) and convergent (e.g. hybridization, reassortment, recombination) evolution. The standard approach to inference of hybridization networks is to (i) reconstruct rooted gene trees and (ii) leverage gene tree discordance for network inference. Recently, we introduced a method called RF-Net for accurate inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks from input gene trees in the presence of errors commonly found in phylogenetic trees. While RF-Net demonstrated the ability to accurately infer networks with up to four reticulations from erroneous input gene trees, its application was limited by the number of reticulations it could handle in a reasonable amount of time. This limitation is particularly restrictive in the inference of the evolutionary history of segmented RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), where reassortment is one of the major mechanisms shaping the evolution of these pathogens. Here, we expand the functionality of RF-Net that makes it significantly more applicable in practice. Crucially, we introduce a fast extension to RF-Net, called Fast-RF-Net, that can handle large numbers of reticulations without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, we develop automatic stopping criteria to select the appropriate number of reticulations heuristically and implement a feature for RF-Net to output error-corrected input gene trees. We then conduct a comprehensive study of the original method and its novel extensions and confirm their efficacy in practice using extensive simulation and empirical IAV evolutionary analyses. RF-Net 2 is available at https://github.com/flu-crew/rf-net-2. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methodological paper about phylogenetic network inference for virus reassortment and hybridization, without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Incursion of H5N8 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) into gamebirds in England.
Abstract: The 2016-17 European outbreak of H5N8 HPAIV (Clade 2.3.4.4b) affected a wider range of avian species than the previous H5N8 outbreak (2014-15), including an incursion of H5N8 HPAIV into gamebirds in England. Natural infection of captive-reared pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) led to variable disease presentation; clinical signs included ruffled feathers, reluctance to move, bright green faeces, and/or sudden mortality. Several birds exhibited neurological signs (nystagmus, torticollis, ataxia). Birds exhibiting even mild clinical signs maintained substantial levels of virus replication and shedding, with preferential shedding via the oropharyngeal route. Gross pathology was consistent with HPAIV, in gallinaceous species but diphtheroid plaques in oropharyngeal mucosa associated with necrotising stomatitis were novel but consistent findings. However, minimal or modest microscopic pathological lesions were detected despite the systemic dissemination of the virus. Serology results indicated differences in the timeframe of exposure for each case (n = 3). This supported epidemiological conclusions confirming that the movement of birds between sites and other standard husbandry practices with limited hygiene involved in pheasant rearing (including several fomite pathways) contributed to virus spread between premises.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports an outbreak of H5N8 in gamebirds with clinical and pathological descriptions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Generation of a pdmH1N1 2018 Influenza A Reporter Virus Carrying a mCherry Fluorescent Protein in the PA Segment.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Through serial passage in mice, we generated a recombinant pdmH1N1 2009 IAV, A/Guangdong/GLW/2018 (GLW/18-MA), which encodes an mCherry gene fused to the C-terminal of a polymerase acidic (PA) segment and demonstrated comparable growth kinetics to the wild-type. Nine mutations were identified in the GLW/18-MA genome: PA (I61M, E351G, and G631S), NP (E292G), HA1 (T164I), HA2 (N117S and P160S), NA (W61R), and NEP (K44R). The recombinant IAV reporter expresses mCherry, a red fluorescent protein, at a high level and maintains its genetic integrity after five generations of serial passages in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK) cells. Moreover, the imaging is noninvasive and permits the monitoring of infection in living mice. Treatment with oseltamivir or baicalin followed by infection with the reporter IAV led to a decrease in fluorescent protein signal in living mice. This result demonstrates that the IAV reporter virus is a powerful tool to study viral pathogenicity and transmission and to develop and evaluate novel anti-viral drugs, inhibitors, and vaccines in the future.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes generation of a reporter influenza virus carrying mCherry for imaging infection, focusing on viral tools rather than genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: The Dual Role of CCR5 in the Course of Influenza Infection: Exploring Treatment Opportunities.
Abstract: Influenza is one of the most relevant respiratory viruses to human health causing annual epidemics, and recurrent pandemics. Influenza disease is principally associated with inappropriate activation of the immune response. Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and its cognate chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are rapidly induced upon influenza infection, contributing to leukocyte recruitment into the airways and a consequent effective antiviral response. Here we discuss the existing evidence for CCR5 role in the host immune responses to influenza virus. Complete absence of CCR5 in mice revealed the receptor's role in coping with influenza <i>via</i> the recruitment of early memory CD8+ T cells, B cell activation and later recruitment of activated CD4+ T cells. Moreover, CCR5 contributes to inflammatory resolution by enhancing alveolar macrophages survival and reprogramming macrophages to pro-resolving phenotypes. In contrast, CCR5 activation is associated with excessive recruitment of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and NK cells in models of severe influenza pneumonia. The available data suggests that, while CCL5 can play a protective role in influenza infection, CCL3 may contribute to an overwhelming inflammatory process that can harm the lung tissue. In humans, the gene encoding CCR5 might contain a 32-base pair deletion, resulting in a truncated protein. While discordant data in literature regarding this CCR5 mutation and influenza severity, the association of CCR5delta32 and HIV resistance fostered the development of different CCR5 inhibitors, now being tested in lung inflammation therapy. The potential use of CCR5 inhibitors to modulate the inflammatory response in severe human influenza infections is to be addressed.
Relevant: False
Reason: This review discusses the role of host CCR5 in influenza infection and immune response, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Evolution of Viral Pathogens Follows a Linear Order.
Abstract: Although lessons have been learned from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, the rapid evolution of the viruses means that future outbreaks of a much larger scale are possible, as shown by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses as well as viruses in general. This study reports a comparative analysis of the amino acid usage within several key viral families and genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks, including coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus-HKU1 [HCoV-HKU1], HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), flavivirus (dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and Zika) and ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo ebolavirus). Our analysis reveals that the distribution of amino acid usage in the viral genome is constrained to follow a linear order, and the distribution remains closely related to the viral species within the family or genus. This constraint can be adapted to predict viral mutations and future variants of concern. By studying previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we have adapted this naturally occurring pattern to determine that although pangolin plays a role in the outbreak of COVID-19, it may not be the sole agent as an intermediate animal. In addition to this study, our findings contribute to the understanding of viral mutations for subsequent development of vaccines and toward developing a model to determine the source of the outbreak. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study reports a comparative analysis of amino acid usage within several key viral genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks. Interestingly, there is evidence that the amino acid usage within the viral genomes is not random but in a linear order.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes amino acid usage patterns across viral families but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Human N-Alpha-Acetyltransferase 60 Promotes Influenza A Virus Infection by Dampening the Interferon Alpha Signaling.
Abstract: N-alpha-acetyltransferase 60 (NAA60) is the most recently discovered N-terminal acetyltransferase and found only in multicellular eukaryotes. NAA60 localizes to the Golgi complex and is one of the only two N-terminal acetyltransferases known to localize to an organelle. Furthermore, NAA60 possesses a unique ability of catalyzing the acetylation of membrane-anchored proteins at the N-terminus and histones at the lysine side chains. Herein, we demonstrate that NAA60 exhibits proviral properties during influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interfering with the interferon (IFN) α signaling. We found that the depletion and overexpression of NAA60 reduced and enhanced, respectively, the IAV growth in a cell type- and IAV strain-independent manner. Mechanistically, the IAV-induced expression of IFNα was increased and decreased in NAA60-depleted and -overexpressing cells, respectively. Furthermore, the depletion of NAA60 enhanced the level of phosphorylated STAT1 transcription factor as well as the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as MX1, CH25H, IFITM3, ISG15 and viperin in infected cells. Whereas the overexpression of NAA60 produced opposite results. Finally, similar results were obtained when the NAA60-depleted cells were treated with purified IFNα. These findings, in conjunction with our recent findings where N-terminal acetylation of many host proteins increased in response to the IAV infection, indicate an important role of N-terminal acetylation during IAV replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of host NAA60 in modulating interferon signaling during influenza infection, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Host Non-Coding RNA Regulates Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Outbreaks of influenza, caused by the influenza A virus (IAV), occur almost every year in various regions worldwide, seriously endangering human health. Studies have shown that host non-coding RNA is an important regulator of host-virus interactions in the process of IAV infection. In this paper, we comprehensively analyzed the research progress on host non-coding RNAs with regard to the regulation of IAV replication. According to the regulation mode of host non-coding RNAs, the signal pathways involved, and the specific target genes, we found that a large number of host non-coding RNAs directly targeted the PB1 and PB2 proteins of IAV. Nonstructural protein 1 and other key genes regulate the replication of IAV and indirectly participate in the regulation of the retinoic acid-induced gene I-like receptor signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway, and other major intracellular viral response signaling pathways to regulate the replication of IAV. Based on the above findings, we mapped the regulatory network of host non-coding RNAs in the innate immune response to the influenza virus. These findings will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the function and mechanism of host non-coding RNAs in the cellular anti-virus response as well as clues to the mechanism of cell-virus interactions and the discovery of antiviral drug targets.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host non-coding RNAs regulating influenza A virus replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A Virus Uses PSMA2 for Downregulation of the NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress Response.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV), an obligatory intracellular parasite, uses host cellular molecules to complete its replication cycle and suppress immune responses. Proteasome subunit alpha type 2 (PSMA2) is a cellular protein highly expressed in IAV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. PSMA2 is part of the 20S proteasome complex that degrades or recycles defective proteins and involves proteolytic modification of many cellular regulatory proteins. However, the role of PSMA2 in IAV replication is not well understood. In this study, PSMA2 knockdown (KD) in A549 cells caused a significant reduction in extracellular progeny IAV, but intracellular viral protein translation and viral RNA transcription were not affected. This indicates that PSMA2 is a critical host factor for IAV maturation. To better understand the interplay between PSMA2 KD and IAV infection at the proteomic level, we used the SomaScan 1.3K version, which measures 1,307 proteins to analyze alterations induced by these treatments. We found seven cellular signaling pathways, including phospholipase C signaling, Pak signaling, and nuclear factor erythroid 2p45-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response signaling, that were inhibited by IAV infection but significantly activated by PSMA2 KD. Further analysis of NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response signaling indicated IAV inhibits accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but ROS levels significantly increased during IAV infection in PSMA2 KD cells. However, IAV infection caused significantly higher NFR2 nuclear translocation that was inhibited in PSMA2 KD cells. This indicates that PSMA2 is required for NRF2-mediated ROS neutralization and that IAV uses PSMA2 to escape viral clearance via the NRF2-mediated cellular oxidative response. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus (IAV) remains one of the most significant infectious agents, responsible for 3 million to 5 million illnesses each year and more than 50 million deaths during the 20th century. The cellular processes that promote and inhibit IAV infection and pathogenesis remain only partially understood. PSMA2 is a critical component of the 20S proteasome and ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is important in the replication of numerous viruses. This study examined host protein responses to IAV infection alone, PSMA2 knockdown alone, and IAV infection in the presence of PSMA2 knockdown and determined that interfering with PSMA2 function affected IAV maturation. These results help us better understand the importance of PSMA2 in IAV replication and may pave the way for designing additional IAV antivirals targeting PSMA2 or the host proteasome for the treatment of seasonal flu.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of host protein PSMA2 in influenza A virus replication and oxidative stress response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Rapid and sensitive detection of high pathogenicity Eurasian clade 2.3.4.4b avian influenza viruses in wild birds and poultry.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is classified as high or low pathogenicity AIV (HPAIV/LPAIV) based on intravenous pathogenicity in chickens and/or the presence or absence of multiple basic residues at the heamagglutinin (HA) cleavage site (CS). Since 2014, Europe has experienced waves of incursions of H5Nx HPAIV. Between November 2020 and March 2021, these included HPAIV H5N8, with sporadic of H5N1 and H5N5 (all clade 2.3.4.4b), detected in more than 300 "found dead" wild birds submitted through a passive surveillance programme in the United Kingdom. Currently, H5Nx HPAIV detection relies on identification of AIV RNA and H5 subtyping using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. The pathotype is subsequently determined by Sanger sequencing of the HA CS. Here, we report the validation and application of a rapid, more cost-effective HP H5-detection rRT-PCR assay. The HP H5 rRT-PCR assay specifically, sensitively and reproducibly detected RNA from contemporary clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAIVs with comparable sensitivity to the diagnostic H5-specific rRT-PCR; LPAIV H5 RNA and non-AIV RNA were not detected. On material from "found-dead" wild birds, and for statutory disease diagnosis on poultry, the HP H5 rRT-PCR results provided 100% discrimination when compared to conventional CS sequencing, significantly reducing time-to-pathotype determination and cost, enhancing the diagnostic workflow.

Title: The battle for autophagy between host and influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is an infectious pathogen, threatening the population and public safety with its epidemics. Therefore, it is essential to better understand influenza virus biology to develop efficient strategies against its pathogenicity. Autophagy is an important cellular process to maintain cellular homeostasis by cleaning up the hazardous substrates in lysosome. Accumulating research has also suggested that autophagy is a critical mechanism in host defense responses against IAV infection by degrading viral particles and activating innate or acquired immunity to induce viral clearance. However, IAV has conversely hijacked autophagy to strengthen virus infection by blocking autophagy maturation and further interfering host antiviral signalling to promote viral replication. Therefore, how the battle for autophagy between host and IAV is carried out need to be known. In this review, we describe the role of autophagy in host defence and IAV survival, and summarize the role of influenza proteins in subverting the autophagic process as well as then concentrate on how host utilize antiviral function of autophagy to prevent IAV infection.

Title: Sequential infections with rhinovirus and influenza modulate the replicative capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract.
Abstract: Although frequently reported since the beginning of the pandemic, questions remain regarding the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interaction with circulating respiratory viruses in coinfected patients. We here investigated dual infections involving early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha variant and three of the most prevalent respiratory viruses, rhinovirus (RV) and Influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), in reconstituted respiratory airway epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was impaired by primary, but not secondary, rhino- and influenza virus infection. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 had no effect on the replication of these seasonal respiratory viruses. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 correlated better with immune response triggered by RV, IAV and IBV than the virus entry. Using neutralizing antibody against type I and III interferons, SARS-CoV-2 blockade in dual infections could be partly prevented. Altogether, these data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 interaction with seasonal respiratory viruses would be modulated by interferon induction and could impact SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology when circulation of other respiratory viruses is restored.

Title: Nonclassical autophagy activation pathways are essential for production of infectious Influenza A virus in vitro.
Abstract: Autophagy is a critical mechanism deployed by eukaryotic cells in response to stress, including viral infection, to boost the innate antimicrobial responses. However, an increasing number of pathogens hijack the autophagic machinery to facilitate their own replication. Influenza A virus (IAV), responsible for several global pandemics, has an intricate dependence on autophagy for successful replication in mammalian cells. To elucidate key chokepoints in the host stress responses facilitating IAV replication, we constructed a meta-transcriptome of IAV and host gene expression dynamics during early (1-3 hpi), mid (4-6 hpi), and late (8-12 hpi) stages of the viral replication cycle at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 1 and 5. We supplemented the global transcriptome study with phosphoproteomic analysis of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) signaling in lung carcinoma (predominantly used as an in vitro model of IAV replication) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We report significant differences in the activation profiles of autophagy regulating genes upon IAV infection at the two MOI as well as divergent dependence on ULK1 signaling within the normal and cancer cells. Regardless of the cell model, JNK-Thr187 signaling was crucial for the production of infectious viral particles.

Title: Antiviral Activity and Underlying Action Mechanism of Euglena Extract against Influenza Virus.
Abstract: It is difficult to match annual vaccines against the exact influenza strain that is spreading in any given flu season. Owing to the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains, new approaches for treating influenza are needed. <i>Euglena gracilis</i> (hereinafter Euglena), microalga, used as functional foods and supplements, have been shown to alleviate symptoms of influenza virus infection in mice. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of microalgae against the influenza virus is unknown. Here, we aimed to study the antiviral activity of Euglena extract against the influenza virus and the underlying action mechanism using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Euglena extract strongly inhibited infection by all influenza virus strains examined, including those resistant to the anti-influenza drugs oseltamivir and amantadine. A time-of-addition assay revealed that Euglena extract did not affect the cycle of virus replication, and cell pretreatment or prolonged treatment of infected cells reduced the virus titer. Thus, Euglena extract may activate the host cell defense mechanisms, rather than directly acting on the influenza virus. Moreover, various minerals, mainly zinc, in Euglena extract were found to be involved in the antiviral activity of the extract. In conclusion, Euglena extract could be a potent agent for preventing and treating influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates antiviral activity of Euglena extract against influenza virus focusing on host defense activation, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Transcriptomic Characterization Reveals Attributes of High Influenza Virus Productivity in MDCK Cells.
Abstract: The Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line is among the most commonly used cell lines for the production of influenza virus vaccines. As cell culture-based manufacturing is poised to replace egg-based processes, increasing virus production is of paramount importance. To shed light on factors affecting virus productivity, we isolated a subline, H1, which had twice the influenza virus A (IAV) productivity of the parent (P) through cell cloning, and characterized H1 and P in detail on both physical and molecular levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed that within a few hours after IAV infection, viral mRNAs constituted over one fifth of total mRNA, with several viral genes more highly expressed in H1 than P. Functional analysis of the transcriptome dynamics showed that H1 and P responded similarly to IAV infection, and were both subjected to host shutoff and inflammatory responses. Importantly, H1 was more active in translation and RNA processing intrinsically and after infection. Furthermore, H1 had more subdued inflammatory and antiviral responses. Taken together, we postulate that the high productivity of IAV hinges on the balance between suppression of host functions to divert cellular resources and the sustaining of sufficient activities for virus replication. Mechanistic insights into virus productivity can facilitate the process optimization and cell line engineering for advancing influenza vaccine manufacturing.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on transcriptomic differences in MDCK cell lines affecting influenza virus productivity, emphasizing host cell factors rather than viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral Gene Expression in Young and Aged Murine Lung during H1N1 and H3N2.
Abstract: Influenza is a respiratory virus that alone or in combination with secondary bacterial pathogens can contribute to the development of acute pneumonia in persons >65 years of age. Host innate immune antiviral signaling early in response to influenza is essential to inhibit early viral replication and guide the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Using young adult (3 months) and aged adult mice infected with mouse adapted H1N1 or H3N2, the results of our study illustrate dysregulated and/or diminished activation of key signaling pathways in aged lung contribute to increased lung inflammation and morbidity. Specifically, within the first seven days of infection, there were significant changes in genes associated with TLR and RIG-I signaling detected in aged murine lung in response to H1N1 or H3N2. Taken together, the results of our study expand our current understanding of age-associated changes in antiviral signaling in the lung.

Airway serine proteases are required to cleave hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to initiate an infection in the human airway. We hypothesized that SPINK6 may inhibit common airway serine proteases and restrict IAV activation. We demonstrate that SPINK6 specifically suppresses the proteolytic activity of HAT and KLK5, HAT- and KLK5-mediated HA cleavage, and restricts virus maturation and replication. SPINK6 constrains the activation of progeny virions and impairs viral growth; and vice versa, blocking endogenous SPINK6 enhances HA cleavage and viral growth in physiological-relevant human airway organoids where SPINK6 is intrinsically expressed. In IAV-infected mice, SPINK6 significantly suppresses viral growth and improves mouse survival. Notably, individuals carrying the higher SPINK6 expression allele were protected from human H7N9 infection. Collectively, SPINK6 is a novel host inhibitor of serine proteases in the human airway and restricts IAV activation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the host protein SPINK6's inhibition of influenza virus activation, focusing on host-virus interaction rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A cell-based multiplex immunoassay platform using fluorescent protein-barcoded reporter cell lines.
Abstract: Multiplex immunoassays with acellular antigens are well-established based on solid-phase platforms such as the Luminex<sup>®</sup> technology. Cell barcoding by amine-reactive fluorescent dyes enables analogous cell-based multiplex assays, but requires multiple labeling reactions and quality checks prior to every assay. Here we describe generation of stable, fluorescent protein-barcoded reporter cell lines suitable for multiplex screening of antibody to membrane proteins. The utility of this cell-based system, with the potential of a 256-plex cell panel, is demonstrated by flow cytometry deconvolution of barcoded cell panels expressing influenza A hemagglutinin trimers, or native human CCR2 or CCR5 multi-span proteins and their epitope-defining mutants. This platform will prove useful for characterizing immunity and discovering antibodies to membrane-associated proteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes a cell-based multiplex immunoassay platform for antibody screening, focusing on methodology rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Two phytocompounds from Schinopsis brasiliensis show promising antiviral activity with multiples targets in Influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus, the main flu agent, affects billions of people worldwide. Conventional treatments still present limitations related to drug-resistance and severe side effects. As a result, natural product-derived molecules have been increasingly investigated as prospect drug candidates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible anti-flu activity and to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters, by in silico approaches, of the Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. phytochemical compounds. Nine phytocompounds and six antiviral drugs (Amantadine, Umifenovir, Favipiravir, Nitazoxanide, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir) were selected for the analyses against four Influenza A proteins: neuraminidase, polymerase basic protein 2, hemagglutinin and M2 ion channel protein. The molecular docking, the predicted antiviral activity, the predicted toxicity and the pharmacokinetics investigations were conducted. The obtained results demonstrated that Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone display promising in silico antiviral activity (binding energy < 5.0 and ≥ 9.0 kcal/mol) and safety (low toxicity than commercial anti-flu drugs). Overall, this study corroborated the hypothesis that S. brasiliensis barks extract has a biological activity against Influenza A virus. Additionally, Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone have multiple targets in Influenza A virus and showed themselves as the most promising phytocompounds to be isolated and considered for the therapeutic arsenal against the flu.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses in silico approaches to evaluate phytocompounds against influenza proteins, focusing on drug discovery rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Tissue Specific Transcriptome Changes Upon Influenza A Virus Replication in the Duck.
Abstract: Ducks are the natural host and reservoir of influenza A virus (IAV), and as such are permissive to viral replication while being unharmed by most strains. It is not known which mechanisms of viral control are globally regulated during infection, and which are specific to tissues during infection. Here we compare transcript expression from tissues from Pekin ducks infected with a recombinant H5N1 strain A/Vietnam 1203/04 (VN1203) or an H5N2 strain A/British Columbia 500/05 using RNA-sequencing analysis and aligning reads to the NCBI assembly ZJU1.0 of the domestic duck (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) genome. Highly pathogenic VN1203 replicated in lungs and showed systemic dissemination, while BC500, like most low pathogenic strains, replicated in the intestines. VN1203 infection induced robust differential expression of genes all three days post infection, while BC500 induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes on day 2 post infection. While there were many genes globally upregulated in response to either VN1203 or BC500, tissue specific gene expression differences were observed. Lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 and intestines of birds infected with BC500, tissues important in influenza replication, showed highest upregulation of pattern recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes early in the response. These tissues also appear to have specific downregulation of inflammatory components, with downregulation of distinct sets of proinflammatory cytokines in lung, and downregulation of key components of leukocyte recruitment and complement pathways in intestine. Our results suggest that global and tissue specific regulation patterns help the duck control viral replication as well as limit some inflammatory responses in tissues involved in replication to avoid damage.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes tissue-specific transcriptome changes in ducks upon influenza infection, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The Roles of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 and 4 in Pneumococcal Nasal Colonization and Subsequent Development of Invasive Disease.
Abstract: Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, neuronal stimulations widely known to be associated with thermal responses, pain induction, and osmoregulation, have been shown in recent studies to have underlying mechanisms associated with inflammatory responses. The role of TRP channels on inflammatory milieu during bacterial infections has been widely demonstrated. It may vary among types of channels/pathogens, however, and it is not known how TRP channels function during pneumococcal infections. <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> can cause severe infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis, with systemic inflammatory responses. This study examines the role of TRP channels (TRPV1 and TRPV4) for pneumococcal nasal colonization and subsequent development of invasive pneumococcal disease in a mouse model. Both TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels were shown to be related to regulation of the development of pneumococcal diseases. In particular, the influx of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells) in the nasal cavity and the bactericidal activity were significantly suppressed among TRPV4 knockout mice. This may lead to severe pneumococcal pneumonia, resulting in dissemination of the bacteria to various organs and causing high mortality during influenza virus coinfection. Regulating host immune responses by TRP channels could be a novel strategy against pathogenic microorganisms causing strong local/systemic inflammation.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates the role of host TRP channels in pneumococcal infection and inflammation, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Age-seroprevalence curves for the multi-strain structure of influenza A virus.
Abstract: The relationship between age and seroprevalence can be used to estimate the annual attack rate of an infectious disease. For pathogens with multiple serologically distinct strains, there is a need to describe composite exposure to an antigenically variable group of pathogens. In this study, we assay 24,402 general-population serum samples, collected in Vietnam between 2009 to 2015, for antibodies to eleven human influenza A strains. We report that a principal components decomposition of antibody titer data gives the first principal component as an appropriate surrogate for seroprevalence; this results in annual attack rate estimates of 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.1%) for subtype H3 and 16.0% (95% CI: 14.7% - 17.3%) for subtype H1. The remaining principal components separate the strains by serological similarity and associate birth cohorts with their particular influenza histories. Our work shows that dimensionality reduction can be used on human antibody profiles to construct an age-seroprevalence relationship for antigenically variable pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes age-seroprevalence curves for influenza A virus strains using antibody data, focusing on epidemiology and serology rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: MicroRNAs affect GPCR and Ion channel genes needed for influenza replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses worldwide. Understanding how to regulate influenza virus replication is important for developing vaccine and therapeutic strategies. Identifying microRNAs (miRs) that affect host genes used by influenza virus for replication can support an antiviral strategy. In this study, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and ion channel (IC) host genes in human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells used by influenza virus for replication (Orr-Burks <i>et al.</i>, 2021) were examined as miR target genes following A/CA/04/09- or B/Yamagata/16/1988 replication. Thirty-three miRs were predicted to target GPCR or IC genes and their miR mimics were evaluated for their ability to decrease influenza virus replication. Paired miR inhibitors were used as an ancillary measure to confirm or not the antiviral effects of a miR mimic. Fifteen miRs lowered influenza virus replication and four miRs were found to reduce replication irrespective of virus strain and type differences. These findings provide evidence for novel miR disease intervention strategies for influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on microRNAs affecting host genes needed for influenza replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Interferon mediated prophylactic protection against respiratory viruses conferred by a prototype live attenuated influenza virus vaccine lacking non-structural protein 1.
Abstract: The influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known for its ability to hinder the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) during viral infection. Influenza viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ΔNS1 virus results in an antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that ΔNS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on ΔNS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses the use of a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine lacking NS1 protein for prophylaxis, focusing on immune response rather than direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: First human infection of avian influenza A(H5N6) virus reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic, February-March 2021.
Abstract: In March 2021, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) reported an avian influenza A(H5N6) virus infection in a 5-year-old child identified through sentinel surveillance. This was the first human A(H5N6) infection reported outside of China. A multidisciplinary investigation undertook contact tracing and enhanced human and animal surveillance in surrounding villages and live bird markets. Seven Muscovy ducks tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Sequenced viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4h and were closely related to viruses detected in poultry in Vietnam and to previous viruses detected in Laos. Surveillance and coordinated outbreak response remain essential to global health security.
Relevant: False
Reason: The report focuses on detection and surveillance of H5N6 virus infection without detailed analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A simple model for how the risk of pandemics from different virus families depends on viral and human traits.
Abstract: Different virus families, like influenza or corona viruses, exhibit characteristic traits such as typical modes of transmission and replication as well as specific animal reservoirs in which each family of viruses circulate. These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population, and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of different virus families. A key trait of viruses that "spillover" from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a theoretical modeling study relating virus family traits to pandemic risk, without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: Age-Specific Etiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections and Influenza Vaccine Effectivity in Prevention of Hospitalization in Russia, 2018-2019 Season.
Abstract: The expansion and standardization of clinical trials, as well as the use of sensitive and specific molecular diagnostics methods, provide new information on the age-specific roles of influenza and other respiratory viruses in development of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Here, we present the results of the multicenter hospital-based study aimed to detect age-specific impact of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). The 2018-2019 influenza season in Russia was characterized by co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus subtypes which were detected among hospitalized patients with SARI in 19.3% and 16.4%, respectively. RSV dominated among ORV (15.1% of total cases and 26.8% in infants aged ≤ 2 years). The most significant SARI agents in intensive care units were RSV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, (37.3% and 25.4%, respectively, of PCR-positive cases). Hyperthermia was the most frequently registered symptom for influenza cases. In contrast, hypoxia, decreased blood O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and dyspnea were registered more often in RSV, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus infection in young children. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalization of patients with PCR-confirmed influenza was evaluated using test-negative case-control design. IVE for children and adults was estimated to be 57.0% and 62.0%, respectively. Subtype specific IVE was higher against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, compared to influenza A(H3N2) (60.3% and 45.8%, respectively). This correlates with delayed antigenic drift of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and genetic heterogeneity of the influenza A(H3N2) population. These studies demonstrate the need to improve seasonal influenza prevention and control in all countries as states by the WHO Global Influenza Strategy for 2019-2030 initiative.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiology, age-specific etiology, and vaccine effectiveness without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Drug repositioning of Clopidogrel or Triamterene to inhibit influenza virus replication in vitro.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and substantial health concerns. Infection may result in mild to severe respiratory disease associated with morbidity and some mortality. Several anti-influenza drugs are available, but these agents target viral components and are susceptible to drug resistance. There is a need for new antiviral drug strategies that include repurposing of clinically approved drugs. Drugs that target cellular machinery necessary for influenza virus replication can provide a means for inhibiting influenza virus replication. We used RNA interference screening to identify key host cell genes required for influenza replication, and then FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed for targeting host genes. We examined the effects of Clopidogrel and Triamterene to inhibit A/WSN/33 (EC50 5.84 uM and 31.48 uM, respectively), A/CA/04/09 (EC50 6.432 uM and 3.32 uM, respectively), and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (EC50 0.28 uM and 0.11 uM, respectively) replication. Clopidogrel and Triamterene provide a druggable approach to influenza treatment across multiple strains and subtypes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on drug repositioning targeting host factors to inhibit influenza replication, without direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A Deep Learning Approach for Predicting Antigenic Variation of Influenza A H3N2.
Abstract: Modeling antigenic variation in influenza (flu) virus A H3N2 using amino acid sequences is a promising approach for improving the prediction accuracy of immune efficacy of vaccines and increasing the efficiency of vaccine screening. Antigenic drift and antigenic jump/shift, which arise from the accumulation of mutations with small or moderate effects and from a major, abrupt change with large effects on the surface antigen hemagglutinin (HA), respectively, are two types of antigenic variation that facilitate immune evasion of flu virus A and make it challenging to predict the antigenic properties of new viral strains. Despite considerable progress in modeling antigenic variation based on the amino acid sequences, few studies focus on the deep learning framework which could be most suitable to be applied to this task. Here, we propose a novel deep learning approach that incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long-short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network to predict antigenic variation. In this approach, CNN extracts the complex local contexts of amino acids while the BLSTM neural network captures the long-distance sequence information. When compared to the existing methods, our deep learning approach achieves the overall highest prediction performance on the validation dataset, and more encouragingly, it achieves prediction agreements of 99.20% and 96.46% for the strains in the forthcoming year and in the next two years included in an existing set of chronological amino acid sequences, respectively. These results indicate that our deep learning approach is promising to be applied to antigenic variation prediction of flu virus A H3N2.

Reason: This is a computational deep learning study predicting antigenic variation from amino acid sequences, without experimental genotype-phenotype validation.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Canine RIG-I against Canine Influenza Virus and Interactions between Canine RIG-I and CIV.
Abstract: RIG-I functions as a virus sensor that induces a cellular antiviral response. Although it has been investigated in other species, there have been no further studies to date on canine RIG-I against canine influenza virus (CIV). In the present study, we cloned the RIG-I gene of beagle dogs and characterized its expression, subcellular localization, antiviral response, and interactions with CIV proteins. RIG-I was highly expressed and mainly localized in the cytoplasm, with low levels detected in the nucleus. The results revealed that overexpression of the CARD domain of RIG-I and knockdown of RIG-I showed its ability to activate the RLR pathway and induced the expression of downstream interferon-stimulated genes. Moreover, overexpression of canine RIG-I suppressed the replication of CIV. The association between RIG-I and CIV was evaluated with the luciferase assay and by indirect immunofluorescence and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses. The results showed that CIV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can strongly suppress the RIG-I-mediated innate immune response, and the novel interactions between CIV matrix proteins (M1 and M2) and canine RIG-I were disclosed. These findings provide a basis for investigating the antiviral mechanism of canine RIG-I against CIV, which can lead to effective strategies for preventing CIV infection in dogs.

Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral activity of canine RIG-I and its interaction with canine influenza virus proteins, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: RNA-Seq Analysis of Influenza A Virus-Induced Transcriptional Changes in Mice Lung and Its Possible Implications for the Virus Pathogenicity in Mice.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) is an important cause of respiratory disease worldwide. It is well known that alveolar epithelial cells are the target cells for the IAV, but there is relatively limited knowledge regarding the role of macrophages during IAV infection. Here, we aimed to analyze transcriptome differences in mouse lungs and macrophage (RAW264.7) cell lines infected with either A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (CA09) or A/chicken/SD/56/2015 H9N2 (SD56) using deep sequencing. The uniquely differentially expressed genes (UDEGs) were analyzed with the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases; the results showed that the lungs infected with the two different viruses had different enrichments of pathways and terms. Interestingly, CA09 virus infection in mice was mostly involved with genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), while the most significant differences after SD56 infection in mice were in immune-related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RAW264.7 cells revealed that regulation of the cell cycle was of great significance after CA09 infection, whereas the regulation of the immune response was most enriched after SD56 infection, which was consistent with analysis results in the lung. Similar results were obtained from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), where cell cycle regulation was extensively activated in RAW264.7 macrophages infected with the CA09 virus. Disorder of the cell cycle is likely to affect their normal immune regulation, which may be an important factor leading to their different prognoses. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the CA09 virus that caused a pandemic and explain the different reactivities of monocytes/macrophages infected by H9N2 and H1N1 IAV subtypes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes transcriptomic changes in mice infected with two influenza A virus subtypes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Characterizing the Countrywide Epidemic Spread of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Kenya between 2009 and 2018.
Abstract: The spatiotemporal patterns of spread of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses on a countrywide scale are unclear in many tropical/subtropical regions mainly because spatiotemporally representative sequence data are lacking. We isolated, sequenced, and analyzed 383 A(H1N1)pdm09 viral genomes from hospitalized patients between 2009 and 2018 from seven locations across Kenya. Using these genomes and contemporaneously sampled global sequences, we characterized the spread of the virus in Kenya over several seasons using phylodynamic methods. The transmission dynamics of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Kenya were characterized by (i) multiple virus introductions into Kenya over the study period, although only a few of those introductions instigated local seasonal epidemics that then established local transmission clusters, (ii) persistence of transmission clusters over several epidemic seasons across the country, (iii) seasonal fluctuations in effective reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>e</sub>) associated with lower number of infections and seasonal fluctuations in relative genetic diversity after an initial rapid increase during the early pandemic phase, which broadly corresponded to epidemic peaks in the northern and southern hemispheres, (iv) high virus genetic diversity with greater frequency of seasonal fluctuations in 2009-2011 and 2018 and low virus genetic diversity with relatively weaker seasonal fluctuations in 2012-2017, and (v) virus spread across Kenya. Considerable influenza virus diversity circulated within Kenya, including persistent viral lineages that were unique to the country, which may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within understudied low-to-middle-income tropical and subtropical regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of influenza viruses in humans and to inform vaccination strategies within these regions.

Title: Optimisation of Neuraminidase Expression for Use in Drug Discovery by Using HEK293-6E Cells.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a highly contagious virus that causes significant human mortality and morbidity annually. The most effective drugs for treating influenza are the neuraminidase inhibitors, but resistance to these inhibitors has emerged, and additional drug discovery research on neuraminidase and other targets is needed. Traditional methods of neuraminidase production from embryonated eggs are cumbersome, while insect cell derived protein is less reflective of neuraminidase produced during human infection. Herein we describe a method for producing neuraminidase from a human cell line, HEK293-6E, and demonstrate the method by producing the neuraminidase from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain. This method produced high levels of soluble neuraminidase expression (>3000 EU/mL), was enhanced by including a secretion signal from a viral chemokine binding protein, and does not require co-expression of additional proteins. The neuraminidase produced was of sufficient quantity and purity to support high resolution crystal structure determination. The structure solved using this protein conformed to the previously reported structure. Notably the glycosylation at three asparagine residues was superior in quality to that from insect cell derived neuraminidase. This method of production of neuraminidase should prove useful in further studies, such as the characterisation of inhibitor binding.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a method for neuraminidase protein expression for drug discovery without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cellular Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulates Cell Survival Mechanisms in Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are respiratory pathogens that are able to hijack multiple cellular mechanisms to drive their replication. Consequently, several viral and cellular proteins undergo posttranslational modifications such as dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In eukaryotic cells, dephosphorylation is mainly catalyzed by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). While the function of kinases in IAV infection is quite well studied, only little is known about the role of PP2A in IAV replication. Here, we show, by using knockdown and inhibition approaches of the catalytic subunit PP2Ac, that this phosphatase is important for efficient replication of several IAV subtypes. This could neither be attributed to alterations in the antiviral immune response nor to changes in transcription or translation of viral genes. Interestingly, decreased PP2Ac levels resulted in a significantly reduced cell viability after IAV infection. Comprehensive kinase activity profiling identified an enrichment of process networks related to apoptosis and indicated a synergistic action of hyper-activated PI3K/Akt, MAPK/JAK-STAT and NF-kB signaling pathways, collectively resulting in increased cell death. Taken together, while IAV seems to effectively tap leftover PP2A activity to ensure efficient viral replication, reduced PP2Ac levels fail to orchestrate cell survival mechanisms to protect infected cells from early cell death.

Reason: The study investigates the role of host protein phosphatase 2A in cell survival during influenza infection, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Short-hairpin RNAs delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus inhibited the replication of influenza A viruses in vitro.
Abstract: Antiviral short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) were investigated for their potential prophylactic and therapeutic applications related to the influenza A virus (IAV). To express shRNAs efficiently, an H1 promoter was inserted into the commercial rAAV2 system. The modified rAAV2 system could express shRNAs, and the purified rAAV was obtained at levels over 10<sup>13</sup> viral genomes/ml and 10<sup>10</sup> viral infection units/ml. The shNP-1496-n and shM2-925 delivered by rAAV could inhibit the replication of the H1N1 and H5N1 virus by targeting the conserved regions of the IAV nucleoprotein and matrix 2 genes in MDCK cells. The shNP-1496-n and shM2-925 expressed by rAAV could provide potent and long-term anti-H5N1 virus effects in rAAV-shRNA-enriched MDCK cells. Our findings provide a rational basis for developing RNA interference for the prevention and therapy of IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies antiviral shRNAs delivered by rAAV to inhibit influenza virus replication, focusing on therapeutic approach rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Exploring the epidemiological changes of common respiratory viruses since the COVID-19 pandemic: a hospital study in Hangzhou, China.
Abstract: Adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus are common causes of respiratory infections. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on their prevalence. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemic changes of common respiratory viruses in the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University in Hangzhou, China, from October of 2017 to February of 2021. We collected statistics from 121,529 patients in the outpatient and inpatient departments of the hospital who had throat or nose swabs collected for testing for four virus antigens by the colloidal gold method. Of these, 13,200 (10.86%) were positive for influenza A virus, 8,402 (6.91%) were positive for influenza B virus, 6,056 (4.98%) were positive for adenovirus, and 4,739 (3.90%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The positivity rates of the influenza A virus (0-14 years old, P = 0.376; over 14 years old, P = 0.197) and respiratory syncytial virus (0-14 years old, P = 0.763; over 14 years old, P = 0.465) did not differ significantly by gender. After January of 2020, influenza virus infection decreased significantly. The positivity rate of respiratory syncytial virus remained high, and its epidemic season was similar to before. Strict respiratory protection and regulation of crowd activities have a great impact on the epidemic characteristics of viruses. After major changes in the public health environment, virus epidemics and their mutations should be monitored closely, extensively, and continuously.

Title: IFN-λ1 Displays Various Levels of Antiviral Activity In Vitro in a Select Panel of RNA Viruses.
Abstract: Type III interferons (lambda IFNs) are a quite new, small family of three closely related cytokines with interferon-like activity. Attention to IFN-λ is mainly focused on direct antiviral activity in which, as with IFN-α, viral genome replication is inhibited without the participation of immune system cells. The heterodimeric receptor for lambda interferons is exposed mainly on epithelial cells, which limits its possible action on other cells, thus reducing the likelihood of developing undesirable side effects compared to type I IFN. In this study, we examined the antiviral potential of exogenous human IFN-λ1 in cellular models of viral infection. To study the protective effects of IFN-λ1, three administration schemes were used: 'preventive' (pretreatment); 'preventive/therapeutic' (pre/post); and 'therapeutic' (post). Three IFN-λ1 concentrations (from 10 to 500 ng/mL) were used. We have shown that human IFN-λ1 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells with all three treatment schemes. In addition, we have shown a decrease in the viral loads of CHIKV and IVA with the 'preventive' and 'preventive/therapeutic' regimes. No significant antiviral effect of IFN-λ1 against AdV was detected. Our study highlights the potential for using IFN-λ as a broad-spectrum therapeutic agent against respiratory RNA viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of IFN-λ1 against various viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bioprinted Multi-Cell Type Lung Model for the Study of Viral Inhibitors.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) continuously causes epidemics and claims numerous lives every year. The available treatment options are insufficient and the limited pertinence of animal models for human IAV infections is hampering the development of new therapeutics. Bioprinted tissue models support studying pathogenic mechanisms and pathogen-host interactions in a human micro tissue environment. Here, we describe a human lung model, which consisted of a bioprinted base of primary human lung fibroblasts together with monocytic THP-1 cells, on top of which alveolar epithelial A549 cells were printed. Cells were embedded in a hydrogel consisting of alginate, gelatin and collagen. These constructs were kept in long-term culture for 35 days and their viability, expression of specific cell markers and general rheological parameters were analyzed. When the models were challenged with a combination of the bacterial toxins LPS and ATP, a release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-8 was observed, confirming that the model can generate an immune response. In virus inhibition assays with the bioprinted lung model, the replication of a seasonal IAV strain was restricted by treatment with an antiviral agent in a dose-dependent manner. The printed lung construct provides an alveolar model to investigate pulmonary pathogenic biology and to support development of new therapeutics not only for IAV, but also for other viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a bioprinted lung model for studying viral inhibitors but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: TRIM22. A Multitasking Antiviral Factor.
Abstract: Viral invasion of target cells triggers an immediate intracellular host defense system aimed at preventing further propagation of the virus. Viral genomes or early products of viral replication are sensed by a number of pattern recognition receptors, leading to the synthesis and production of type I interferons (IFNs) that, in turn, activate a cascade of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral functions. Among these, several members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family are antiviral executors. This article will focus, in particular, on TRIM22 as an example of a multitarget antiviral member of the TRIM family. The antiviral activities of TRIM22 against different DNA and RNA viruses, particularly human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV), will be discussed. TRIM22 restriction of virus replication can involve either direct interaction of TRIM22 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with viral proteins, or indirect protein-protein interactions resulting in control of viral gene transcription, but also epigenetic effects exerted at the chromatin level.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses antiviral activities of TRIM22 against viruses and mechanisms of action but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Re-emergence of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in wild birds, China.
Abstract: In mid-November 2020, deaths of whooper swan were reported in the Yellow River Reservoir Area, China. In the present study, we describe the genetic characterizations and phylogenetic relationships of four clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 highly avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) identified from a sick whooper swan and environmental samples collected in the Yellow River Reservoir Area in late November 2020. They were closely related to recent H5Nx HPAIVs causing outbreaks in Eurasia in the 2020-2021 influenza season, suggesting these isolates might be imported into China via migratory birds. The newly identified H5N8 HPAIVs possessed Q226 and G228 (H3 numbering), indicating that they prefer to avian-like receptors. However, they had three mutations falling within known antigenic regions, including T144A in antigenic region A, T192I in antigenic region B, and N240D in antigenic region D. Our study highlights the risk of the rapid global spread of H5N8 HPAIVs and the necessity for continuous monitoring of avian influenza viruses in wild birds.

Title: Novel isoforms of influenza virus PA-X and PB1-F2 indicated by automatic annotation.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome contains 8 gene segments encoding 10 commonly recognized proteins. Additional protein products have been identified, including PB1-F2 and PA-X. We report the in-silico identification of novel isoforms of PB1-F2 and PA-X in influenza virus genomes sequenced from avian samples. The isoform observed in PA-X includes a mutated stop codon that should extend the protein product by 8 amino acids. The isoform observed in PB1-F2 includes two nonsense mutations that should truncate the N-terminal region of the protein product and remove the entire mitochondrial targeting domain. Both isoforms were uncovered during automatic annotation of CEIRS sequence data. Nominally termed PA-X8 and PB1-F2-Cterm, both predicted isoforms were subsequently found in other annotated influenza genomes previously deposited in GenBank. Both isoforms were noticed due to discrepant annotations output by two annotation engines, indicating a benefit of incorporating multiple algorithms during gene annotation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies novel isoforms of influenza virus proteins through annotation but does not provide experimental links between these genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Chrysin against Influenza Virus Replication via Inhibition of Autophagy.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals, which have high morbidity and mortality rates. Although several drugs that inhibit viral neuraminidase are used to treat influenza infections, the emergence of resistant viruses necessitates the urgent development of new antiviral drugs. Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid that exhibits antiviral activity against enterovirus 71 (EV71) by inhibiting viral 3C protease activity. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of chrysin against influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR/8). Chrysin significantly inhibited A/PR/8-mediated cell death and the replication of A/PR/8 at concentrations up to 2 μM. Viral hemagglutinin expression was also markedly decreased by the chrysin treatment in A/PR/8-infected cells. Through the time course experiment and time-of-addition assay, we found that chrysin inhibited viral infection at the early stages of the replication cycle. Additionally, the nucleoprotein expression of A/PR/8 in A549 cells was reduced upon treatment with chrysin. Regarding the mechanism of action, we found that chrysin inhibited autophagy activation by increasing the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We also confirmed a decrease in LC3B expression and LC3-positive puncta levels in A/PR/8-infected cells. These results suggest that chrysin exhibits antiviral activity by activating mTOR and inhibiting autophagy to inhibit the replication of A/PR/8 in the early stages of infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral activity of chrysin against influenza virus replication and its mechanism but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Effects of Basic Amino Acids and Their Derivatives on SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Amino acids have been implicated with virus infection and replication. Here, we demonstrate the effects of two basic amino acids, arginine and lysine, and their ester derivatives on infection of two enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza A virus. We found that lysine and its ester derivative can efficiently block infection of both viruses in vitro. Furthermore, the arginine ester derivative caused a significant boost in virus infection. Studies on their mechanism of action revealed that the compounds potentially disturb virus uncoating rather than virus attachment and endosomal acidification. Our findings suggest that lysine supplementation and the reduction of arginine-rich food intake can be considered as prophylactic and therapeutic regimens against these viruses while also providing a paradigm for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates effects of amino acids on virus infection mechanisms but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral Activity of Influenza A Virus Defective Interfering Particles against SARS-CoV-2 Replication In Vitro through Stimulation of Innate Immunity.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, worldwide vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 show only limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study shows antiviral activity of influenza defective interfering particles against SARS-CoV-2 but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: NS1: A Key Protein in the "Game" Between Influenza A Virus and Host in Innate Immunity.
Abstract: Since the influenza pandemic occurred in 1918, people have recognized the perniciousness of this virus. It can cause mild to severe infections in animals and humans worldwide, with extremely high morbidity and mortality. Since the first day of human discovery of it, the "game" between the influenza virus and the host has never stopped. NS1 protein is the key protein of the influenza virus against host innate immunity. The interaction between viruses and organisms is a complex and dynamic process, in which they restrict each other, but retain their own advantages. In this review, we start by introducing the structure and biological characteristics of NS1, and then investigate the factors that affect pathogenicity of influenza which determined by NS1. In order to uncover the importance of NS1, we analyze the interaction of NS1 protein with interferon system in innate immunity and the molecular mechanism of host antagonism to NS1 protein, highlight the unique biological function of NS1 protein in cell cycle.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on NS1 protein functions and interactions with host immunity, discussing factors affecting pathogenicity but not providing explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: IFITM Proteins That Restrict the Early Stages of Respiratory Virus Infection Do Not Influence Late-Stage Replication.
Abstract: Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit a broad range of enveloped viruses by blocking entry into host cells. We used an inducible overexpression system to investigate if IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 could modulate early and/or late stages of influenza A virus (IAV) or parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) infection in human A549 airway epithelial cells. IAV and PIV-3 represent respiratory viruses which utilize distinct cellular entry pathways. We verify entry by endocytosis for IAV, whereas PIV-3 infection was consistent with fusion at the plasma membrane. Following induction prior to infection, all three IFITM proteins restricted the percentage of IAV-infected cells at 8 hours postinfection. In contrast, prior induction of IFITM1 and IFITM2 did not inhibit PIV-3 infection, although a modest reduction was observed with IFITM3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of endogenous IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 expression, in the presence or absence of pretreatment with type I interferon, resulted in increased IAV, but not PIV-3, infection. This finding suggests that while all three IFITMs display antiviral activity against IAV, they do not restrict the early stages of PIV-3 infection. IAV and PIV-3 infection culminates in viral egress through budding at the plasma membrane. Inducible expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 immediately after infection did not impact titers of infectious virus released from IAV- or PIV-3-infected cells. Our findings show that IFITM proteins differentially restrict the early stages of infection of two respiratory viruses with distinct cellular entry pathways but do not influence the late stages of replication for either virus. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the initial stages of infection for several respiratory viruses; however, their potential to modulate the later stages of virus replication has not been explored. In this study, we highlight the utility of an inducible overexpression system to assess the impact of IFITM proteins on either early- or late-stage replication of two respiratory viruses. We demonstrate antiviral activity by IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 against influenza A virus (IAV) but not parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) during the early stages of cellular infection. Furthermore, IFITM induction following IAV or PIV-3 infection does not restrict the late stages of replication of either virus. Our findings show that IFITM proteins can differentially restrict the early stages of infection of two viruses with distinct cellular entry pathways and yet do not influence the late stages of replication for either virus.

Title: Cellular 5'-3' mRNA Exoribonuclease XRN1 Inhibits Interferon Beta Activation and Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Cellular 5'-3' exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1) is best known for its role as a decay factor, which by degrading 5' monophosphate RNA after the decapping of DCP2 in P-bodies (PBs) in <i>Drosophila</i>, yeast, and mammals. XRN1 has been shown to degrade host antiviral mRNAs following the influenza A virus (IAV) PA-X-mediated exonucleolytic cleavage processes. However, the mechanistic details of how XRN1 facilitates influenza A virus replication remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that XRN1 and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV are directly associated and colocalize in the PBs. Moreover, XRN1 downregulation impaired viral replication while the viral titers were significantly increased in cells overexpressing XRN1, which suggest that XRN1 is a positive regulator in IAV life cycle. We further demonstrated that the IAV growth curve could be suppressed by adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (pAp) treatment, an inhibitor of XRN1. In virus-infected <i>XRN1</i> knockout cells, the phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (p-IRF3) protein, interferon beta (<i>IFN-β</i>) mRNA, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were significantly increased, resulting in the enhancement of the host innate immune response and suppression of viral protein production. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which the IAV hijacks the cellular XRN1 to suppress the host innate immune response and to facilitate viral replication. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A novel mechanistic discovery reveals that the host decay factor XRN1 contributes to influenza A virus replication, which exploits XRN1 activity to inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune response. Here, we identified a novel interaction between viral NS1 and host XRN1. Knockdown and knockout of XRN1 expression in human cell lines significantly decreased virus replication while boosting RIG-I-mediated interferon immune response, suggesting that XRN1 facilitates influenza A virus replication. The pAp effect as XRN1 inhibitor was evaluated; we found that pAp was capable of suppressing viral growth. To our knowledge, this study shows for the first time that a negative-strand and nucleus-replicating RNA virus, as influenza A virus, can hijack cellular XRN1 to suppress the host RIG-I-dependent innate immune response. These findings provide new insights suggesting that host XRN1 plays a positive role in influenza A virus replication and that the inhibitor pAp may be used in novel antiviral drug development.

Reason: The paper focuses on the role of host XRN1 in influenza A virus replication without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Long Noncoding RNA IFITM4P Regulates Host Antiviral Responses by Acting as a Competing Endogenous RNA.
Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in numerous cellular processes. Increasing evidence suggests that some lncRNAs function in immunity through various complex mechanisms. However, implication of a large fraction of lncRNAs in antiviral innate immunity remains uncharacterized. Here, we identified an lncRNA called lncRNA IFITM4P that was transcribed from <i>interferon-induced transmembrane protein 4 pseudogene</i> (<i>IFITM4P</i>), a pseudogene belonging to the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family. We found that expression of lncRNA IFITM4P was significantly induced by infection with several viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Importantly, lncRNA IFITM4P acted as a positive regulator of innate antiviral immunity. Ectopic expression of lncRNA IFITM4P significantly suppressed IAV replication <i>in vitro</i>, whereas IFITM4P deficiency promoted viral production. We further observed that expression of lncRNA IFITM4P was upregulated by interferon (IFN) signaling during viral infection, and altering the expression of this lncRNA had significant effects on the mRNA levels of several IFITM family members, including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. Moreover, lncRNA IFITM4P was identified as a target of the microRNA miR-24-3p, which represses mRNA of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. The experiments demonstrated that lncRNA IFITM4P was able to cross-regulate the expression of IFITM family members as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), leading to increased stability of these IFITM mRNAs. Together, our results reveal that lncRNA IFITM4P, as a ceRNA, is involved in innate immunity against viral infection through the lncRNA IFITM4P-miR-24-3p-IFITM1/2/3 regulatory network. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> lncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes, but their involvement in host antiviral responses remains largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that the pseudogene <i>IFITM4P</i> belonging to the IFITM family can transcribe a functional long noncoding RNA termed lncRNA IFITM4P. Importantly, results showed that lncRNA IFITM4P was involved in innate antiviral immunity, which resembles some interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, lncRNA IFITM4P was identified as a target of miR-24-3p and acts as a ceRNA to inhibit the replication of IAV through regulating the mRNA levels of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. These data provide new insight into the role of a previously uncharacterized lncRNA encoded by a pseudogene in the host antiviral response and a better understanding of the IFITM antiviral network.

Title: Wood smoke particle exposure in mice reduces the severity of influenza infection.
Abstract: Elevated ambient temperatures and extreme weather events have increased the incidence of wildfires world-wide resulting in increased wood smoke particle (WSP). Epidemiologic data suggests that WSP exposure associates with exacerbations of respiratory diseases, and with increased respiratory viral infections. To assess the impact of WSP exposure on host response to viral pneumonia, we performed WSP exposures in rodents followed by infection with mouse adapted influenza (HINI-PR8). C57BL/6 male mice aged 6-8 weeks were challenged with WSP or PBS by oropharyngeal aspiration in acute (single dose) or sub-acute exposures (day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10). Additional groups underwent sub-acute exposure followed by infection by influenza or heat-inactivated (HI) virus. Following exposures/infection, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to assess for total cell counts/differentials, total protein, protein carbonyls and hyaluronan. Lung tissue was assessed for viral counts by real time PCR. When compared to PBS, acute WSP exposure associated with an increase in airspace macrophages. Alternatively, sub-acute exposure resulted in a dose dependent increase in airspace neutrophils. Sub-acute WSP exposure followed by influenza infection was associated with improved respiratory viral outcomes including reduced weight loss and increased blood oxygen saturation, and decreased protein carbonyls and viral titers. Flow cytometry demonstrated dynamic changes in pulmonary macrophage and T cell subsets based on challenge with WSP and influenza. This data suggests that sub-acute WSP exposure can improve host response to acute influenza infection.

Title: Aryl Sulfonamide Inhibits Entry and Replication of Diverse Influenza Viruses via the Hemagglutinin Protein.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause approximately half a million deaths every year worldwide. Vaccines are available but partially effective, and the number of antiviral medications is limited. Thus, it is crucial to develop therapeutic strategies to counteract this major pathogen. Influenza viruses enter the host cell via their hemagglutinin (HA) proteins. The HA subtypes of influenza A virus are phylogenetically classified into groups 1 and 2. Here, we identified an inhibitor of the HA protein, a tertiary aryl sulfonamide, that prevents influenza virus entry and replication. This compound shows potent antiviral activity against diverse H1N1, H5N1, and H3N2 influenza viruses encoding HA proteins from both groups 1 and 2. Synthesis of derivatives of this aryl sulfonamide identified moieties important for antiviral activity. This compound may be considered as a lead for drug development with the intent to be used alone or in combination with other influenza A virus antivirals to enhance pan-subtype efficacy.

Title: Long noncoding RNAs in respiratory viruses: A review.
Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Both human lncRNAs and lncRNAs encoded by viruses can modulate the expression of host genes which are critical for viral replication, latency, activation of signalling pathways, cytokine and chemokine production, RNAi processing, expression of interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Studies on lncRNAs as key regulators of host-virus interactions may give new insights into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of related diseases. This current review focuses on the role of lncRNAs, and their interactions with respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Title: Ultrastructure of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complexes during viral RNA synthesis.
Abstract: The single-stranded, negative-sense, viral genomic RNA (vRNA) of influenza A virus is encapsidated by viral nucleoproteins (NPs) and an RNA polymerase to form a ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) with a helical, rod-shaped structure. The vRNP is responsible for transcription and replication of the vRNA. However, the vRNP conformation during RNA synthesis is not well understood. Here, using high-speed atomic force microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy, we investigated the native structure of influenza A vRNPs during RNA synthesis in vitro. Two distinct types of vRNPs were observed in association with newly synthesized RNAs: an intact, helical rod-shaped vRNP connected with a folded RNA and a deformed vRNP associated with a looped RNA. Interestingly, the looped RNA was a double-stranded RNA, which likely comprises a nascent RNA and the template RNA detached from NPs of the vRNP. These results suggest that while some vRNPs keep their helical structures during RNA synthesis, for the repeated cycle of RNA synthesis, others accidentally become structurally deformed, which likely results in failure to commence or continue RNA synthesis. Thus, our findings provide the ultrastructural feature of vRNPs during RNA synthesis.
Relevant: False

Abstract: In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a young patient infected by avian influenza A (H5N6) virus in Anhui Province, East China, and analyzed genomic features of the pathogen in 2020. Through the cross-sectional investigation of external environment monitoring (December 29-31, 2020), 1909 samples were collected from Fuyang City. It was found that the positive rate of H5N6 was higher than other areas obviously in Tianma poultry market, where the case appeared. In addition, dual coinfections were detected with a 0.057% polymerase chain reaction positive rate the surveillance years. The virus was the clade 2.3.4.4, which was most likely formed by genetic reassortment between H5N6 and H9N2 viruses. This study found that the evolution rates of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the virus were higher than those of common seasonal influenza viruses. The virus was still highly pathogenic to poultry and had a preference for avian receptor binding.

Title: Broadly Reactive IgG Responses to Heterologous H5 Prime-Boost Influenza Vaccination Are Shaped by Antigenic Relatedness to Priming Strains.
Abstract: Prime-boost vaccinations of humans with different H5 strains have generated broadly protective antibody levels. However, the effect of an individual's H5 exposure history on antibody responses to subsequent H5 vaccination is poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the IgG responses to H5 influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Ind05) virus vaccination in three cohorts: (i) a doubly primed group that had received two H5 virus vaccinations, namely, against influenza A/Vietnam/203/2004 (Vie04) virus 5 years prior and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (HK97) 11 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; (ii) a singly primed group that had received a vaccination against Vie04 virus 5 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; and (iii) an H5-naive group that received two doses of the Ind05 vaccine 28 days apart. Hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive IgG levels were estimated by a multiplex assay against an HA panel that included 21 H5 strains and 9 other strains representing the H1, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. Relative HA antibody landscapes were generated to quantitatively analyze the magnitude and breadth of antibody binding after vaccination. We found that short-interval priming and boosting with the Ind05 vaccine in the naive group generated a low anti-H5 response. Both primed groups generated robust antibody responses reactive to a broad range of H5 strains after receiving a booster injection of Ind05 vaccine; IgG antibody levels persisted longer in subjects who had been doubly primed years ago. Notably, the IgG responses were strongest against the first priming H5 strain, which reflects influenza virus immune imprinting. Finally, the broad anti-H5 IgG response was stronger against strains having a small antigenic distance from the initial priming strain. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The antigenic shift and draft of hemagglutinin (HA) in influenza viruses is accepted as one of the major reasons for immune evasion. The analysis of B cell immune responses to influenza infection and vaccination is complicated by the impact of exposure history and antibody cross-reactions between antigenically similar influenza strains. To assist in such analyses, the influenza "antibody landscape" method has been used to analyze and visualize the relationship of antibody-mediated immunity to antigenic distances between influenza strains. In this study, we describe a "relative antibody landscape" method that calculates the antigenic distance between the vaccine influenza strain and other H5 strains and uses this relative antigenic distance to plot the anti-H5 IgG levels postvaccination. This new method quantitatively estimates and visualizes the correlation between the humoral response to a particular influenza strain and the antigenic distance from other strains. Our findings demonstrate the effect of a subject's H5 exposure history on H5 vaccine responses quantified by the relative antibody landscape method.

Title: Subclinical Infection and Transmission of Clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus in Mandarin Duck (<i>Aix galericulata</i>) and Domestic Pigeon (<i>Columbia livia domestica</i>).
Abstract: Since 2014, H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have caused outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in multiple continents, including Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. Wild birds were suspected to be the sources of the local and global spreads of HPAIV. This study evaluated the infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIV in mandarin ducks <i>(Aix</i><i>galericulata</i>) and domestic pigeons (<i>Columbia livia domestica</i>). None of the birds used in this study, 20 mandarin ducks or 8 pigeons, showed clinical signs or mortality due to H5N6 HPAI infection. Two genotypes of H5N6 HPAIV showed replication and transmission by direct and indirect contact between mandarin ducks. H5N6 HPAIV replicated and transmitted by direct contact between pigeons, although the viral shedding titer and duration were relatively lower and shorter than those in mandarin ducks. Influenza virus antigen was detected in various internal organs of infected mandarin ducks and pigeons, indicating systemic infection. Therefore, our results indicate mandarin ducks and pigeons can be subclinically infected with clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIV and transfer the virus to adjacent birds. The role of mandarin ducks and pigeons in the spread and prevalence of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 viruses should be carefully monitored.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of a virus in birds but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification and Structural Aspects of G-Quadruplex-Forming Sequences from the Influenza A Virus Genome.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics, therefore is an important research subject for scientists around the world. Despite the high variability of its genome, the structure of viral RNA (vRNA) possesses features that remain constant between strains and are biologically important for virus replication. Therefore, conserved structural motifs of vRNA can represent a novel therapeutic target. Here, we focused on the presence of G-rich sequences within the influenza A/California/07/2009(H1N1) genome and their ability to form RNA G-quadruplex structures (G4s). We identified 12 potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) and determined their conservation among the IAV strains using bioinformatics tools. Then we examined the propensity of PQS to fold into G4s by various biophysical methods. Our results revealed that six PQS oligomers could form RNA G-quadruplexes. However, three of them were confirmed to adopt G4 structures by all utilized methods. Moreover, we showed that these PQS motifs are present within segments encoding polymerase complex proteins indicating their possible role in the virus biology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies conserved RNA structural motifs in the influenza genome but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular Characterization of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses H5N6 Detected in Denmark in 2018-2019.
Abstract: Beginning in late 2017, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 viruses caused outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in several European countries. H5N6 viruses were detected in 43 wild birds found dead throughout Denmark. Most of the Danish virus-positive dead birds were found in the period from February to April 2018. However, unlike the rest of Europe, sporadic HPAI H5N6-positive dead wild birds were detected in Denmark in July, August, September, and December 2018, with the last positive bird being found in January 2019. HPAI viruses were not detected in active surveillance of apparently healthy wild birds. In this study, we use full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to investigate the wild bird HPAI H5N6 viruses found in Denmark. The Danish viruses were found to be closely related to those of contemporary HPAI H5N6 viruses detected in Europe. Their sequences formed two clusters indicating that at least two or more introductions of H5N6 into Denmark occurred. Notably, all viruses detected in the latter half of 2018 and in 2019 grouped into the same cluster. The H5N6 viruses appeared to have been maintained undetected in the autumn 2018.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study performs molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of H5N6 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Novel reassortant 2.3.4.4B H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating among wild, domestic birds in Xinjiang, Northwest China.
Abstract: The H5 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of clade 2.3.4.4 circulate in wild and domestic birds worldwide. In 2017, nine strains of H5N6 AIVs were isolated from aquatic poultry in Xinjiang, Northwest China. This study aimed to analyze the origin, reassortment, and mutations of the AIV isolates. AIVs were isolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of poultry. Identification was accomplished by inoculating isolates into embryonated chicken eggs and performing hemagglutination tests and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The viral genomes were amplified with RT-PCR and then sequenced. The sequence alignment, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristic analyses were performed by using bioinformatic software. Nine isolates originated from the same ancestor. The viral <i>HA</i> gene belonged to clade 2.3.4.4B, while the <i>NA</i> gene had a close phylogenetic relationship with the 2.3.4.4C H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated from shoveler ducks in Ningxia in 2015. The <i>NP</i> gene was grouped into an independent subcluster within the 2.3.4.4B H5N8 AIVs, and the remaining six genes all had close phylogenetic relationships with the 2.3.4.4B H5N8 HPAIVs isolated from the wild birds in China, Egypt, Uganda, Cameroon, and India in 2016-2017, Multiple basic amino acid residues associated with HPAIVs were located adjacent to the cleavage site of the HA protein. The nine isolates comprised reassortant 2.3.4.4B HPAIVs originating from 2.3.4.4B H5N8 and 2.3.4.4C H5N6 viruses in wild birds. These results suggest that the Northern Tianshan Mountain wetlands in Xinjiang may have a key role in AIVs disseminating from Central China to the Eurasian continent and East African.

Title: Rhinovirus Reduces the Severity of Subsequent Respiratory Viral Infections by Interferon-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms.
Abstract: Coinfection by heterologous viruses in the respiratory tract is common and can alter disease severity compared to infection by individual virus strains. We previously found that inoculation of mice with rhinovirus (RV) 2 days before inoculation with a lethal dose of influenza A virus [A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8)] provides complete protection against mortality. Here, we extended that finding to a second lethal respiratory virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), and analyzed potential mechanisms of RV-induced protection. RV completely prevented mortality and weight loss associated with PVM infection. Major changes in host gene expression upon PVM infection were delayed compared to PR8. RV induced earlier recruitment of inflammatory cells, which were reduced at later times in RV-inoculated mice. Findings common to both virus pairs included the upregulated expression of mucin-associated genes and dampening of inflammation-related genes in mice that were inoculated with RV before lethal virus infection. However, type I interferon (IFN) signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against PR8 but not PVM. IFN signaling had minor effects on PR8 replication and contributed to controlling neutrophilic inflammation and hemorrhagic lung pathology in RV/PR8-infected mice. These findings, combined with differences in virus replication levels and disease severity, suggest that the suppression of inflammation in RV/PVM-infected mice may be due to early, IFN-independent suppression of viral replication, while that in RV/PR8-infected mice may be due to IFN-dependent modulation of immune responses. Thus, a mild upper respiratory viral infection can reduce the severity of a subsequent severe viral infection in the lungs through virus-dependent mechanisms. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Respiratory viruses from diverse families cocirculate in human populations and are frequently detected within the same host. Although clinical studies suggest that infection by multiple different respiratory viruses may alter disease severity, animal models in which we can control the doses, timing, and strains of coinfecting viruses are critical to understanding how coinfection affects disease severity. Here, we compared gene expression and immune cell recruitment between two pairs of viruses (RV/PR8 and RV/PVM) inoculated sequentially in mice, both of which result in reduced severity compared to lethal infection by PR8 or PVM alone. Reduced disease severity was associated with suppression of inflammatory responses in the lungs. However, differences in disease kinetics and host and viral gene expression suggest that protection by coinfection with RV may be due to distinct molecular mechanisms. Indeed, we found that antiviral cytokine signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against lethal infection by PR8 but not PVM.

Title: Genetic characterisation of the influenza viruses circulating in Bulgaria during the 2019-2020 winter season.
Abstract: Influenza viruses have a high potential for genetic changes. The objectives of this study were to analyse influenza virus circulation in Bulgaria during the 2019/2020 season, to perform a phylogenetic and molecular analyses of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences of representative influenza strains, and to identify amino acid substitutions compared to the current vaccine strains. Seasonal influenza viruses A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria-lineage were detected using a real-time RT-PCR in 323 (23.3%), 149 (10.7%) and 138 (9.9%) out of 1387 patient samples studied, respectively. The HA genes of A(H3N2) viruses analysed belonged to clades 3C.3a (21 strains) and 3C.2a (5 strains): subclades 3C.2a1b + T131K, 3C.2a1b + T135K-B and 3C.2a1b + T135K-A. The clade 3C.3a and subclade 3C.2a1b viruses carried 5 and 14-17 substitutions in HA, as well as 3 and 9 substitutions in NA, respectively, in comparison with the A/Kansas/14/2017 vaccine virus, including some substitutions in the HA antigenic sites A, B, C and E. All 21 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses sequenced fell into 6B.1A5A subclade. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of 7-11 substitutions in HA, compared to the A/Brisbane/02/2018 vaccine virus, three of which occurred in antigenic site Sb, along with 6-9 changes at positions in NA. All 10 B/Victoria-lineage viruses sequenced belonged to clade 1A with a triple deletion in HA1 (genetic group 1A(Δ3)B) and carried 7 and 3 substitutions in HA and NA, respectively, with respect to the B/Colorado/06/2017 vaccine virus. The results of this study confirm the rapid evolution of influenza viruses and the need for continuous antigenic and genetic surveillance.

Title: p-cymene impairs SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A (H1N1) viral replication: In silico predicted interaction with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and H1N1 nucleoprotein.
Abstract: Therapeutic regimens for the COVID-19 pandemics remain unmet. In this line, repurposing of existing drugs against known or predicted SARS-CoV-2 protein actions have been advanced, while natural products have also been tested. Here, we propose that p-cymene, a natural monoterpene, can act as a potential novel agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 and other RNA-virus-induced diseases (influenza, rabies, Ebola). We show by extensive molecular simulations that SARS-CoV-2 C-terminal structured domain contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), like SARS-CoV, on which p-cymene binds with low micromolar affinity, impairing nuclear translocation of this protein and inhibiting viral replication, as verified by preliminary in vitro experiments. A similar mechanism may occur in other RNA-viruses (influenza, rabies and Ebola), also verified in vitro for influenza, by interaction of p-cymene with viral nucleoproteins, and structural modification of their NLS site, weakening its interaction with importin A. This common mechanism of action renders therefore p-cymene as a possible antiviral, alone, or in combination with other agents, in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, from SARS-CoV-2 to influenza A infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antiviral effects of p-cymene and its interaction with viral proteins but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Induction of IFN-β through TLR-3- and RIG-I-Mediated Signaling Pathways in Canine Respiratory Epithelial Cells Infected with H3N2 Canine Influenza Virus.
Abstract: Canine influenza virus (CIV) induces acute respiratory disease in dogs. In this study, we aimed to determine the signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-β in a canine respiratory epithelial cell line (KU-CBE) infected with the H3N2 subtype of CIV. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and transcription factors were used to block the IFN-β induction signals in H3N2 CIV-infected KU-CBE cells. Among the PRRs, only the TLR3 and RIG-I expression levels significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001) increased in CIV-infected cells. Following transfection with siRNA specific to TLR3 (siTLR3) or RIG-I (siRIG-I), the mRNA expression levels of IFN-β significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001) decreased, and the protein expression of IFN-β also decreased in infected cells. In addition, co-transfection with both siTLR3 and siRIG-I significantly reduced IRF3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and IFN-β (<i>p</i> < 0.001) mRNA levels. Moreover, the protein concentration of IFN-β was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.01) lower in cells co-transfected with both siTLR3 and siRIG-I than in cells transfected with either siTLR3 or siRIGI alone. Also, the antiviral protein MX1 was only expressed in KU-CBE cells infected with CIV or treated with IFN-β or IFN-α. Thus, we speculate that IFN-β further induces MX1 expression, which might suppress CIV replication. Taken together, these data indicate that TLR3 and RIG-I synergistically induce IFN-β expression via the activation of IRF3, and the produced IFN-β further induces the production of MX1, which would suppress CIV replication in CIV-infected cells.

Title: RNase L limits host and viral protein synthesis via inhibition of mRNA export.
Abstract: RNase L is widely thought to limit viral protein synthesis by cleaving host rRNA and viral mRNA, resulting in translation arrest and viral mRNA degradation. Here, we show that the mRNAs of dengue virus and influenza A virus largely escape RNase L-mediated mRNA decay, and this permits viral protein production. However, activation of RNase L arrests nuclear mRNA export, which strongly inhibits influenza A virus protein synthesis and reduces cytokine production. The heterogeneous and temporal nature of the mRNA export block in individual cells permits sufficient production of antiviral cytokines from transcriptionally induced host mRNAs. This defines RNase L-mediated arrest of mRNA export as a key antiviral shutoff and cytokine regulatory pathway.
Relevant: False

Title: Ceramide and Related Molecules in Viral Infections.
Abstract: Ceramide is a lipid messenger at the heart of sphingolipid metabolism. In concert with its metabolizing enzymes, particularly sphingomyelinases, it has key roles in regulating the physical properties of biological membranes, including the formation of membrane microdomains. Thus, ceramide and its related molecules have been attributed significant roles in nearly all steps of the viral life cycle: they may serve directly as receptors or co-receptors for viral entry, form microdomains that cluster entry receptors and/or enable them to adopt the required conformation or regulate their cell surface expression. Sphingolipids can regulate all forms of viral uptake, often through sphingomyelinase activation, and mediate endosomal escape and intracellular trafficking. Ceramide can be key for the formation of viral replication sites. Sphingomyelinases often mediate the release of new virions from infected cells. Moreover, sphingolipids can contribute to viral-induced apoptosis and morbidity in viral diseases, as well as virus immune evasion. Alpha-galactosylceramide, in particular, also plays a significant role in immune modulation in response to viral infections. This review will discuss the roles of ceramide and its related molecules in the different steps of the viral life cycle. We will also discuss how novel strategies could exploit these for therapeutic benefit.

Title: Influenza Virus-Induced Novel miRNAs Regulate the STAT Pathway.
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression in humans and can control pathogenesis and host-virus interactions. Notably, the role of specific host miRNAs during influenza virus infections are still ill-defined. The central goal of this study was to identify novel miRNAs and their target genes in response to influenza virus infections in airway epithelium. Human airway epithelial cells exposed to influenza A virus (IAV) induced several novel miRNAs that were identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and their target genes by biochemical methods. NGS analysis predicted forty-two RNA sequences as possible miRNAs based on computational algorithms. The expression patterns of these putative miRNAs were further confirmed using RT-PCR in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to H1N1, H9N1(1P10), and H9N1 (1WF10) strains of influenza virus. A time-course study showed significant downregulation of put-miR-34 in H1N1 and put-miR-35 in H9N1(1P10)-infected cells, which is consistent with the NGS data. Additionally, put-miR-34 and put-miR-35 showed a high fold enrichment in an argonaute-immunoprecipitation assay compared to the controls, indicating their ability to form a complex with argonaute protein and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is a typical mode of action found with miRNAs. Our earlier studies have shown that the replication and survival of influenza virus is modulated by certain transcription factors such as NF-ĸB. To identify the target(s) of these putative miRNAs, we screened 84 transcription factors that have a role in viral pathogenesis. Cells transfected with mimic of the put-miR-34 showed a significant decrease in the expression of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3), whereas the inhibitor of put-miR-34 showed a significant increase in STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation. In addition, put-miR-34 had 76% homology to the untranslated region of STAT3. NGS and PCR array data submitted to the Gene Ontology project also predicted the role of transcription factors modulated by put-miR-34. Our data suggest that put-miR-34 may be a good target for antiviral therapy.

Title: The Crossroads between Host Copper Metabolism and Influenza Infection.
Abstract: Three main approaches are used to combat severe viral respiratory infections. The first is preemptive vaccination that blocks infection. Weakened or dead viral particles, as well as genetic constructs carrying viral proteins or information about them, are used as an antigen. However, the viral genome is very evolutionary labile and changes continuously. Second, chemical agents are used during infection and inhibit the function of a number of viral proteins. However, these drugs lose their effectiveness because the virus can rapidly acquire resistance to them. The third is the search for points in the host metabolism the effect on which would suppress the replication of the virus but would not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the host. Here, we consider the possibility of using the copper metabolic system as a target to reduce the severity of influenza infection. This is facilitated by the fact that, in mammals, copper status can be rapidly reduced by silver nanoparticles and restored after their cancellation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses host copper metabolism in relation to influenza infection, not viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: An Overview of Equine Influenza in South America.
Abstract: Equine influenza virus (EIV) is one of the most important respiratory pathogens of horses as outbreaks of the disease lead to significant economic losses worldwide. In this review, we summarize the information available on equine influenza (EI) in South America. In the region, the major events of EI occurred almost in the same period in the different countries, and the EIV isolated showed high genetic identity at the hemagglutinin gene level. It is highly likely that the continuous movement of horses, some of them subclinically infected, among South American countries, facilitated the spread of the virus. Although EI vaccination is mandatory for mobile or congregates equine populations in the region, EI outbreaks continuously threaten the equine industry. Vaccine breakdown could be related to the fact that many of the commercial vaccines available in the region contain out-of-date EIV strains, and some of them even lack reliable information about immunogenicity and efficacy. This review highlights the importance of disease surveillance and reinforces the need to harmonize quarantine and biosecurity protocols, and encourage vaccine manufacturer companies to carry out quality control procedures and update the EIV strains in their products.

Title: Novel Clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A H5N8 and H5N5 Viruses in Denmark, 2020.
Abstract: Since late 2020, outbreaks of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have emerged in Europe. To investigate the evolutionary history of these viruses, we performed genetic characterization on the first HPAI viruses found in Denmark during the autumn of 2020. H5N8 viruses from 14 wild birds and poultry, as well as one H5N5 virus from a wild bird, were characterized by whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The Danish H5N8 viruses were found to be genetically similar to each other and to contemporary European clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, while the Danish H5N5 virus was shown to be a unique genotype from the H5N5 viruses that circulated at the same time in Russia, Germany, and Belgium. Genetic analyses of one of the H5N8 viruses revealed the presence of a substitution (PB2-M64T) that is highly conserved in human seasonal influenza A viruses. Our analyses showed that the late 2020 clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N8 viruses were most likely new incursions introduced by migrating birds to overwintering sites in Europe, rather than the result of continued circulation of H5N8 viruses from previous introductions to Europe in 2016/2017 and early 2020.

Title: Intra-species sialic acid polymorphism in humans: a common niche for influenza and coronavirus pandemics?
Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 159 million confirmed cases with over 3.3 million deaths worldwide, but it remains mystery why most infected individuals (∼98%) were asymptomatic or only experienced mild illness. The same mystery applies to the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which has puzzled the field for a century. Here we discuss dual potential properties of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic viruses that led to the high fatality rate in the small portion of severe cases, while about 98% infected persons in the United States were self-limited with mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic. These variations now have been postulated to be impacted by polymorphisms of the sialic acid receptors in the general population. Since coronaviruses (CoVs) also recognize sialic acid receptors and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and pandemics, similar principles of influenza virus evolution and pandemicity may also apply to CoVs. A potential common principle of pathogen/host co-evolution of influenza and CoVs under selection of host sialic acids in parallel with different epidemic and pandemic influenza and coronaviruses is discussed.

Title: Immune cellular networks underlying recovery from influenza virus infection in acute hospitalized patients.
Abstract: How innate and adaptive immune responses work in concert to resolve influenza disease is yet to be fully investigated in one single study. Here, we utilize longitudinal samples from patients hospitalized with acute influenza to understand these immune responses. We report the dynamics of 18 important immune parameters, related to clinical, genetic and virological factors, in influenza patients across different severity levels. Influenza disease correlates with increases in IL-6/IL-8/MIP-1α/β cytokines and lower antibody responses. Robust activation of circulating T follicular helper cells correlates with peak antibody-secreting cells and influenza heamaglutinin-specific memory B-cell numbers, which phenotypically differs from vaccination-induced B-cell responses. Numbers of influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells increase early in disease and retain an activated phenotype during patient recovery. We report the characterisation of immune cellular networks underlying recovery from influenza infection which are highly relevant to other infectious diseases.

Title: Macrocyclic peptides exhibit antiviral effects against influenza virus HA and prevent pneumonia in animal models.
Abstract: Most anti-influenza drugs currently used, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibit the enzymatic activity of neuraminidase. However, neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses have already been identified from various influenza virus isolates. Here, we report the development of a class of macrocyclic peptides that bind the influenza viral envelope protein hemagglutinin, named iHA. Of 28 iHAs examined, iHA-24 and iHA-100 have inhibitory effects on the in vitro replication of a wide range of Group 1 influenza viruses. In particular, iHA-100 bifunctionally inhibits hemagglutinin-mediated adsorption and membrane fusion through binding to the stalk domain of hemagglutinin. Moreover, iHA-100 shows powerful efficacy in inhibiting the growth of highly pathogenic influenza viruses and preventing severe pneumonia at later stages of infection in mouse and non-human primate cynomolgus macaque models. This study shows the potential for developing cyclic peptides that can be produced more efficiently than antibodies and have multiple functions as next-generation, mid-sized biomolecules.

Title: Viral-Host Interactome Analysis Reveals Chicken STAU2 Interacts With Non-structural Protein 1 and Promotes the Replication of H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus.
Abstract: As a highly pathogenic influenza virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) poses a great threat to poultry production and public health. H5N1 AIV has a small genome and, therefore, relies heavily on its host cellular machinery to replicate. To develop a comprehensive understanding of how H5N1 AIV rewires host cellular machinery during the course of infection, it is crucial to identify which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins. Here, we utilized affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to systematically determine the physical interactions of 11 H5N1 AIV proteins with host proteins in chicken DF1 cells. We identified with high confidence 1,043 H5N1 AIV-chicken interactions involving 621 individual chicken proteins and uncovered a number of host proteins and complexes that were targeted by the viral proteins. Specifically, we revealed that chicken Staufen double-stranded RNA-binding protein 2 interacts with AIV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and promotes the replication of the virus by enhancing the nuclear export of <i>NS1</i> mRNA. This dataset facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of H5N1 AIV infection.

Title: Structure and Activities of the NS1 Influenza Protein and Progress in the Development of Small-Molecule Drugs.
Abstract: The influenza virus causes human disease on a global scale and significant morbidity and mortality. The existing vaccination regime remains vulnerable to antigenic drift, and more seriously, a small number of viral mutations could lead to drug resistance. Therefore, the development of a new additional therapeutic small molecule-based anti-influenza virus is urgently required. The NS1 influenza gene plays a pivotal role in the suppression of host antiviral responses, especially by inhibiting interferon (IFN) production and the activities of antiviral proteins, such as dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase R (PKR) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L. NS1 also modulates important aspects of viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus replication cycle. Taken together, small molecules that target NS1 are believed to offer a means of developing new anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Replication-Competent ΔNS1 Influenza A Viruses Expressing Reporter Genes.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) is able to infect multiple mammalian and avian species, and in humans IAV is responsible for annual seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory disease with significant health and economic impacts. Studying IAV involves laborious secondary methodologies to identify infected cells. Therefore, to circumvent this requirement, in recent years, multiple replication-competent infectious IAV expressing traceable reporter genes have been developed. These IAVs have been very useful for in vitro and/or in vivo studies of viral replication, identification of neutralizing antibodies or antivirals, and in studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy, among others. In this report, we describe, for the first time, the generation and characterization of two replication-competent influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) viruses where the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was substituted by the monomeric (m)Cherry fluorescent or the NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc) proteins. The ΔNS1 mCherry was able to replicate in cultured cells and in Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) deficient mice, although at a lower extent than a wild-type (WT) PR8 virus expressing the same mCherry fluorescent protein (WT mCherry). Notably, expression of either reporter gene (mCherry or Nluc) was detected in infected cells by fluorescent microscopy or luciferase plate readers, respectively. ΔNS1 IAV expressing reporter genes provide a novel approach to better understand the biology and pathogenesis of IAV, and represent an excellent tool to develop new therapeutic approaches against IAV infections.

Title: Nanoparticle composite TPNT1 is effective against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.
Abstract: A metal nanoparticle composite, namely TPNT1, which contains Au-NP (1 ppm), Ag-NP (5 ppm), ZnO-NP (60 ppm) and ClO<sub>2</sub> (42.5 ppm) in aqueous solution was prepared and characterized by spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering analysis and potentiometric titration. Based on the in vitro cell-based assay, TPNT1 inhibited six major clades of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with effective concentration within the range to be used as food additives. TPNT1 was shown to block viral entry by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to interfere with the syncytium formation. In addition, TPNT1 also effectively reduced the cytopathic effects induced by human (H1N1) and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, including the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus isolates. Together with previously demonstrated efficacy as antimicrobials, TPNT1 can block viral entry and inhibit or prevent viral infection to provide prophylactic effects against both SARS-CoV-2 and opportunistic infections.

Reason: The study evaluates antiviral effects of a nanoparticle composite against viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Dynamic Pneumococcal Genetic Adaptations Support Bacterial Growth and Inflammation during Coinfection with Influenza.
Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is one of the primary bacterial pathogens that complicates influenza virus infections. These bacterial coinfections increase influenza-associated morbidity and mortality through a number of immunological and viral-mediated mechanisms, but the specific bacterial genes that contribute to postinfluenza pathogenicity are not known. Here, we used genome-wide transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to reveal bacterial genes that confer improved fitness in influenza virus-infected hosts. The majority of the 32 genes identified are involved in bacterial metabolism, including nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, protein translation, and membrane transport. We generated mutants with single-gene deletions (SGD) of five of the genes identified, SPD1414, SPD2047 (<i>cbiO1</i>), SPD0058 (<i>purD</i>), SPD1098, and SPD0822 (<i>proB</i>), to investigate their effects on <i>in vivo</i> fitness, disease severity, and host immune responses. The growth of the SGD mutants was slightly attenuated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, but each still grew to high titers in the lungs of mock- and influenza virus-infected hosts. Despite high bacterial loads, mortality was significantly reduced or delayed with all SGD mutants. Time-dependent reductions in pulmonary neutrophils, inflammatory macrophages, and select proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also observed. Immunohistochemical staining further revealed altered neutrophil distribution with reduced degeneration in the lungs of influenza virus-SGD mutant-coinfected animals. These studies demonstrate a critical role for specific bacterial genes and for bacterial metabolism in driving virulence and modulating immune function during influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on bacterial genes affecting fitness during coinfection with influenza virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Metabolic shifts modulate lung injury caused by infection with H1N1 influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection alters lung epithelial cell metabolism in vitro by promoting a glycolytic shift. We hypothesized that this shift benefits the virus rather than the host and that inhibition of glycolysis would improve infection outcomes. A/WSN/33 IAV-inoculated C57BL/6 mice were treated daily from 1 day post-inoculation (d.p.i.) with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) to inhibit glycolysis and with the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) to promote flux through the TCA cycle. To block OXPHOS, mice were treated every other day from 1 d.p.i. with the Complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT). 2-DG significantly decreased nocturnal activity, reduced respiratory exchange ratios, worsened hypoxemia, exacerbated lung dysfunction, and increased humoral inflammation at 6 d.p.i. DCA and ROT treatment normalized oxygenation and airway resistance and attenuated IAV-induced pulmonary edema, histopathology, and nitrotyrosine formation. None of the treatments altered viral replication. These data suggest that a shift to glycolysis is host-protective in influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies host metabolic shifts during influenza infection and their effects on disease outcome, without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The cleavage of spike protein НА0→НА1/HA2 by trypsin permits activation of the M2 channel without its proteolytic cleavage in the influenza A virus.
Abstract: M2 plays numerous regulatory roles in influenza A virus infection confirming the old adage: "a little body often harbors a great sense". The comment here demonstrates that a small viral protein M2, having 14 kD m.w. and situating in the virion at a minor amount of only about 40 molecules per virus particle is resistant to trypsin at concentrations initiating the HA0 cleavage and virus infectivity activation. A mechanism involving a programmed disassembly by cascade-type transmembrane signaling of the HA-M2-M1-RNP cooperation during virus entry into the infected cell is proposed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses the role of the M2 protein in virus entry and activation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Entry of influenza A virus into host cells - recent progress and remaining challenges.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are a major burden for human health and thus the topic of intense research efforts. The entry of IAV into host cells is of particular interest as early infection steps are the ideal target for intervention strategies. Here, we review recent key findings in the field of IAV entry. Specifically, we discuss the identification of novel entry receptors, the emerging role of the viral neuraminidase in entry, as well as recent progress from structural studies on the viral hemagglutinin during the fusion process and the viral matrix protein involved in virus uncoating. We also highlight remaining gaps in our understanding of IAV entry and point out important questions for ongoing research efforts.

Title: Antiviral effect of fufang yinhua jiedu (FFYH) granules against influenza A virus through regulating the inflammatory responses by TLR7/MyD88 signaling pathway.
Abstract: Fufang-Yinhua-Jiedu Granules (FFYH) optimized from a Yin-Qiao-San, as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), was used to treat influenza and upper respiratory tract infection and was recommended for the prevention and treatment of SARS in 2003 and current COVID-19 in Anhui Province in 2020. In the clinical studies, FFYH was very effective for the treatment of influenza, but the mechanism of action against influenza A virus remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza A virus in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was investigated for the first time. CPE inhibition assay and HA assay were used to evaluate the in vitro antiviral effects of FFYH against influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. Mice were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of FFYH in vivo with ribavirin and lianhuaqingwen as positive controls. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA transcription of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, and IL-1β mRNA. ELISA was used to examine the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, and IL-1β in sera. The blood parameters were analyzed with auto hematology analyzer. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was also investigated. FFYH showed a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity against H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Furthermore, FFYH dose-dependently increased the survival rate, significantly prolonged the median survival time of mice, and markedly reduced lung injury caused by influenza A virus. Also, FFYH significantly improve the sick signs, food taken, weight loss, blood parameters, lung index, and lung pathological changes. Moreover, FFYH could markedly inhibit the inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IP10, IL-10, and IL-1β mRNA or protein via inhibition of the TLR7/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. FFYH not only showed a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity in vitro, but also exhibited a significant protective effect against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicated that the in vivo antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza virus may be attributed to suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines via regulating the TLR7/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings provide evidence for the clinical treatment of influenza A virus infection with FFYH.

Title: Mammalian and Avian Host Cell Influenza A Restriction Factors.
Abstract: The threat of a new influenza pandemic is real. With past pandemics claiming millions of lives, finding new ways to combat this virus is essential. Host cells have developed a multi-modular system to detect incoming pathogens, a phenomenon called sensing. The signaling cascade triggered by sensing subsequently induces protection for themselves and their surrounding neighbors, termed interferon (IFN) response. This response induces the upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including antiviral effectors, establishing an antiviral state. As well as the antiviral proteins induced through the IFN system, cells also possess a so-called intrinsic immunity, constituted of antiviral proteins that are constitutively expressed, creating a first barrier preceding the induction of the interferon system. All these combined antiviral effectors inhibit the virus at various stages of the viral lifecycle, using a wide array of mechanisms. Here, we provide a review of mammalian and avian influenza A restriction factors, detailing their mechanism of action and in vivo relevance, when known. Understanding their mode of action might help pave the way for the development of new influenza treatments, which are absolutely required if we want to be prepared to face a new pandemic.

Reason: This is a review of host restriction factors against influenza A virus, focusing on host proteins rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Bat Influenza Viruses: Current Status and Perspective.
Abstract: Bats are natural reservoirs for many viruses, including several that are zoonotic. Two unusual H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viruses have been found in New World bats. Although neither of these viruses have been isolated, infectious clone technology has permitted significant progress to understand their biology, which include unique features compared to all other known influenza A viruses. In addition, an H9N2-like influenza A virus was isolated from Old World bats and it shows similar characteristics of normal influenza A viruses. In this review, current status and perspective on influenza A viruses identified in bats is reviewed and discussed.

Title: A comprehensive influenza reporter virus panel for high-throughput deep profiling of neutralizing antibodies.
Abstract: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been developed as potential countermeasures for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Deep characterization of these bnAbs and polyclonal sera provides pivotal understanding for influenza immunity and informs effective vaccine design. However, conventional virus neutralization assays require high-containment laboratories and are difficult to standardize and roboticize. Here, we build a panel of engineered influenza viruses carrying a reporter gene to replace an essential viral gene, and develop an assay using the panel for in-depth profiling of neutralizing antibodies. Replication of these viruses is restricted to cells expressing the missing viral gene, allowing it to be manipulated in a biosafety level 2 environment. We generate the neutralization profile of 24 bnAbs using a 55-virus panel encompassing the near-complete diversity of human H1N1 and H3N2, as well as pandemic subtype viruses. Our system offers in-depth profiling of influenza immunity, including the antibodies against the hemagglutinin stem, a major target of universal influenza vaccines.

Title: First case of acute cholestatic hepatitis attributed to oseltamivir in a young girl with ah1n1 influenza.
Abstract: Oseltamivir caryboxylase is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme neuramidase of the influenza virus particle and it is active against both influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir is indicated for therapy or post-exposure prevention of influenza A and B. Side effects are uncommon and include mild nausea, gastrointestinal upset, dizziness and headache. Despite its widespread use, oseltamivir has not been associated with clinically apparent liver injury. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature linking the development of acute hepatitis to the consumption of oseltamivir in a patient suffering from influenza H1N1 infection.

Title: Viral tropism and detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in feathers of ducks and geese.
Abstract: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza viruses (HPAIVs) display a tissue pantropism, which implies a possible spread in feathers. HPAIV detection from feathers had been evaluated for H5N1 or H7N1 HPAIVs. It was suggested that viral RNA loads could be equivalent or higher in samples of immature feather compared to tracheal (TS) or cloacal swabs (CS). We investigated the suitability of feathers for the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV in ducks and geese field samples. In the six H5N8 positive flocks that were included in this study, TS, CS and immature wing feathers were taken from at least 10 birds. Molecular loads were then estimated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targetting H5 and M genes. In all flocks, viral loads were at least equivalent between feather and swab samples and in most cases up to 10<sup>3</sup> higher in feathers. Bayesian modelling confirmed that, in infected poultry, RT-qPCR was much more likely to be positive when applied on a feather sample only (estimated sensitivity between 0.89 and 0.96 depending on the positivity threshold) than on a combination of a tracheal and a cloacal swab (estimated sensitivity between 0.45 and 0.68 depending on the positivity threshold). Viral tropism and lesions in feathers were evaluated by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Epithelial necrosis of immature feathers and follicles was observed concurrently with positive viral antigen detection and leukocytic infiltration of pulp. Accurate detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIVs in feather samples were finally confirmed with experimental H5N8 infection on 10-week-old mule ducks, as viral loads at 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection were higher in feathers than in tracheal or cloacal swabs. However, feather samples were associated with lower viral loads than tracheal swabs at day 1, suggesting better detectability of the virus in feathers in the later course of infection. These results, based on both field cases and experimental infections, suggest that feather samples should be included in the toolbox of samples for detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses, at least in ducks and geese.

Title: SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, an experimental set-up is used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses cause a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmits efficiently. Serological assays confirm all virus transmission events. Although the experiments do not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for virus transmission via the air between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates transmission of viruses between ferrets but does not explicitly link viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors prevent replication of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.
Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major threat to global health. Vaccines are ideal solutions to prevent infection, but treatments are also needed for those who have contracted the virus to limit negative outcomes, when vaccines are not applicable. Viruses must cross host cell membranes during their life cycle, creating a dependency on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study, we examined whether the synthetic machinery for glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS): (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the United States Food and Drug Administration-approved drug Cerdelga and (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat, which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these inhibitors also disrupt replication of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Our data imply that synthesis of glycosphingolipids is necessary to support viral life cycles and suggest that GCS inhibitors should be further explored as antiviral therapies.

Title: Endosomal TLR3 co-receptor CLEC18A enhances host immune response to viral infection.
Abstract: Human C-type lectin member 18A (CLEC18A) is ubiquitously expressed in human, and highest expression levels are found in human myeloid cells and liver. In contrast, mouse CLEC18A (mCLEC18A) is only expressed in brain, kidney and heart. However, the biological functions of CLEC18A are still unclear. We have shown that a single amino acid change (S<sub>339</sub> →R<sub>339</sub>) in CTLD domain has profound effect in their binding to polysaccharides and house dust mite allergens. In this study, we further demonstrate that CLEC18A and its mutant CLEC18A(S339R) associate with TLR3 in endosome and bind poly (I:C) specifically. Compared to TLR3 alone, binding affinity to poly (I:C) is further increased in TLR3-CLEC18A and TLR3-CLEC18A(S339R) complexes. Moreover, CLEC18A and CLEC18A(S339R) enhance the production of type I and type III interferons (IFNs), but not proinflammatory cytokines, in response to poly (I:C) or H5N1 influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, ROSA-CLEC18A and ROSA-CLEC18A(S339R) mice generate higher amounts of interferons and are more resistant to H5N1 IAV infection. Thus, CLEC18A is a TLR3 co-receptor, and may contribute to the differential immune responses to poly (I:C) and IAV infection between human and mouse.

Title: Mitochondrial morphodynamics alteration induced by influenza virus infection as a new antiviral strategy.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections are major public health threats due to their high rates of morbidity and mortality. Upon influenza virus entry, host cells experience modifications of endomembranes, including those used for virus trafficking and replication. Here we report that influenza virus infection modifies mitochondrial morphodynamics by promoting mitochondria elongation and altering endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering in host cells. Expression of the viral RNA recapitulates these modifications inside cells. Virus induced mitochondria hyper-elongation was promoted by fission associated protein DRP1 relocalization to the cytosol, enhancing a pro-fusion status. We show that altering mitochondrial hyper-fusion with Mito-C, a novel pro-fission compound, not only restores mitochondrial morphodynamics and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites but also dramatically reduces influenza replication. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed Mito-C antiviral property is directly connected with the innate immunity signaling RIG-I complex at mitochondria. Our data highlight the importance of a functional interchange between mitochondrial morphodynamics and innate immunity machineries in the context of influenza viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host mitochondrial morphodynamics changes induced by influenza virus infection and antiviral strategies, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Non-canonical autophagy functions of ATG16L1 in epithelial cells limit lethal infection by influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cause pandemic infections where cytokine storm syndrome and lung inflammation lead to high mortality. Given the high social and economic cost of respiratory viruses, there is an urgent need to understand how the airways defend against virus infection. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that ATG16L1-dependent targeting of LC3 to single-membrane, non-autophagosome compartments - referred to as non-canonical autophagy - protects mice from lethal IAV infection. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy reduced IAV fusion with endosomes and activation of interferon signalling. Conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showed that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leucocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence that restricts IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.

Title: The PB1 protein of influenza A virus inhibits the innate immune response by targeting MAVS for NBR1-mediated selective autophagic degradation.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) has evolved various strategies to counteract the innate immune response using different viral proteins. However, the mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified the PB1 protein of H7N9 virus as a new negative regulator of virus- or poly(I:C)-stimulated IFN induction and specifically interacted with and destabilized MAVS. A subsequent study revealed that PB1 promoted E3 ligase RNF5 to catalyze K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS at Lys362 and Lys461. Moreover, we found that PB1 preferentially associated with a selective autophagic receptor neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) that recognizes ubiquitinated MAVS and delivers it to autophagosomes for degradation. The degradation cascade mediated by PB1 facilitates H7N9 virus infection by blocking the RIG-I-MAVS-mediated innate signaling pathway. Taken together, these data uncover a negative regulatory mechanism involving the PB1-RNF5-MAVS-NBR1 axis and provide insights into an evasion strategy employed by influenza virus that involves selective autophagy and innate signaling pathways.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes viral protein PB1's interaction with host innate immune components, focusing on mechanism rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Virus sensing receptors in cellular infectivity of influenza A virus.
Abstract: An innate immune response is essential to mobilize protective immunity upon the infection of respiratory epithelial cells with influenza A virus (IAV). The response is classified as early (nonspecific effectors), local systematic (effector cells recruitment) and late (antigen to lymphoid organ transport, naive B and T cells recognition, effector cells clonal expansion and differentiation). Virus particles are detected by the host cells as non-self by various sensors that are present on the cell surface, endosomes and cytosol. These sensors are collectively termed as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs distinguish unique molecular signatures known as pathogen-associated molecular pattern, which are present either on the cell surface or within intracellular compartments. PRRs have been classified into five major groups: C-Type Lectin Receptor (CLR), Toll-like receptor (TLR), Nod-like receptor (NLR), Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptor (RLR), which play a role in innate immunity to IAV infection, and the pyrin and hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (PYHIN) domain protein. Here, we discuss the role of PRRs in cellular infectivity of IAV and highlight the recent progress.

Title: Thapsigargin Is a Broad-Spectrum Inhibitor of Major Human Respiratory Viruses: Coronavirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The long-term control strategy of SARS-CoV-2 and other major respiratory viruses needs to include antivirals to treat acute infections, in addition to the judicious use of effective vaccines. Whilst COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out for mass vaccination, the modest number of antivirals in use or development for any disease bears testament to the challenges of antiviral development. We recently showed that non-cytotoxic levels of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump, induces a potent host innate immune antiviral response that blocks influenza A virus replication. Here we show that TG is also highly effective in blocking the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), common cold coronavirus OC43, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in immortalized or primary human cells. TG's antiviral performance was significantly better than remdesivir and ribavirin in their respective inhibition of OC43 and RSV. Notably, TG was just as inhibitory to coronaviruses (OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses (USSR H1N1 and pdm 2009 H1N1) in separate infections as in co-infections. Post-infection oral gavage of acid-stable TG protected mice against a lethal influenza virus challenge. Together with its ability to inhibit the different viruses before or during active infection, and with an antiviral duration of at least 48 h post-TG exposure, we propose that TG (or its derivatives) is a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, OC43, RSV and influenza virus.

Title: Temporin G, an amphibian antimicrobial peptide against influenza and parainfluenza respiratory viruses: Insights into biological activity and mechanism of action.
Abstract: Treatment of respiratory viral infections remains a global health concern, mainly due to the inefficacy of available drugs. Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2.

Title: G-Protein-Coupled Receptor and Ion Channel Genes Used by Influenza Virus for Replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus causes epidemics and sporadic pandemics resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Influenza viruses require host genes to replicate. RNA interference (RNAi) screens can identify host genes coopted by influenza virus for replication. Targeting these proinfluenza genes can provide therapeutic strategies to reduce virus replication. Nineteen proinfluenza G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and 13 proinfluenza ion channel genes were identified in human lung (A549) cells by use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These proinfluenza genes were authenticated by testing influenza virus A/WSN/33-, A/CA/04/09-, and B/Yamagata/16/1988-infected A549 cells, resulting in the validation of 16 proinfluenza GPCR and 5 proinfluenza ion channel genes. These findings showed that several GPCR and ion channel genes are needed for the production of infectious influenza virus. These data provide potential targets for the development of host-directed therapeutic strategies to impede the influenza virus productive cycle so as to limit infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza epidemics result in morbidity and mortality each year. Vaccines are the most effective preventive measure but require annual reformulation, since a mismatch of vaccine strains can result in vaccine failure. Antiviral measures are desirable particularly when vaccines fail. In this study, we used RNAi screening to identify several GPCR and ion channel genes needed for influenza virus replication. Understanding the host genes usurped by influenza virus during viral replication can help identify host genes that can be targeted for drug repurposing or for the development of antiviral drugs. The targeting of host genes is refractory to drug resistance generated by viral mutations, as well as providing a platform for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: Identifies host GPCR and ion channel genes required for influenza replication, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A replication-competent adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induces durable systemic and mucosal immunity.
Abstract: BACKGROUNDTo understand the features of a replicating vaccine that might drive potent and durable immune responses to transgene-encoded antigens, we tested a replication-competent adenovirus type 4 encoding influenza virus H5 HA (Ad4-H5-Vtn) administered as an oral capsule or via tonsillar swab or nasal spray.METHODSViral shedding from the nose, mouth, and rectum was measured by PCR and culturing. H5-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were measured by bead array binding assays. Serum antibodies were measured by a pseudovirus entry inhibition, microneutralization, and HA inhibition assays.RESULTSAd4-H5-Vtn DNA was shed from most upper respiratory tract-immunized (URT-immunized) volunteers for 2 to 4 weeks, but cultured from only 60% of participants, with a median duration of 1 day. Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination induced increases in H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood as well as increases in IgG and IgA in nasal, cervical, and rectal secretions. URT immunizations induced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against H5 that remained stable out to week 26. The duration of viral shedding correlated with the magnitude of the NAb response at week 26. Adverse events (AEs) were mild, and peak NAb titers were associated with overall AE frequency and duration. Serum NAb titers could be boosted to very high levels 2 to 5 years after Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination with recombinant H5 or inactivated split H5N1 vaccine.CONCLUSIONReplicating Ad4 delivered to the URT caused prolonged exposure to antigen, drove durable systemic and mucosal immunity, and proved to be a promising platform for the induction of immunity against viral surface glycoprotein targets.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT01443936 and NCT01806909.FUNDINGIntramural and Extramural Research Programs of the NIAID, NIH (U19 AI109946) and the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS), NIAID, NIH (contract HHSN272201400008C).

Title: Influenza and Influenza Vaccine: A Review.
Abstract: Influenza is a highly contagious, deadly virus, killing nearly half a million people yearly worldwide. The classic symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, cough, and body aches. In the outpatient setting, diagnosis can be made by clinical presentation with optional confirmatory diagnostic testing. Antiviral medications should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of initiation of symptoms. The primary preventive measure against influenza is vaccination, which is recommended for all people 6 months of age or older, including pregnant and postpartum women, unless the individual has a contraindication. Vaccination should occur at the beginning of flu season, which typically begins in October. It takes approximately 14 days after vaccination for a healthy adult to reach peak antibody protection. There are challenges associated with vaccine composition and vaccine uptake. It takes approximately 6 to 8 months to identify and predict which influenza strains to include in the upcoming season's vaccine. During this time, the influenza virus may undergo antigenic drift, that is, mutating to avoid a host immune response. Antigenic drift makes the vaccine less effective in some seasons. The influenza virus occasionally undergoes antigenic shift, in which it changes to a novel virus, creating potential for a pandemic. There are also barriers to vaccine uptake, including lack of or limited access to care and misconceptions about receiving the vaccine. Interventions that improve access to and uptake of the influenza vaccine must be initiated, targeting multiple levels, including health care policy, patients, health care systems, and the health care team. This article reviews information about influenza identification, management, and prevention.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review discusses influenza and vaccines broadly without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Sox4 represses host innate immunity to facilitate pathogen infection by hijacking the TLR signaling networks.
Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential for the protection of the host from pathogen infections by initiating the integration of contextual cues to regulate inflammation and immunity. However, without tightly controlled immune responses, the host will be subjected to detrimental outcomes. Therefore, it is important to balance the positive and negative regulations of TLRs to eliminate pathogen infection, yet avert harmful immunological consequences. This study revealed a distinct mechanism underlying the regulation of the TLR network. The expression of sex-determining region Y-box 4 (Sox4) is induced by virus infection in viral infected patients and cultured cells, which subsequently represses the TLR signaling network to facilitate viral replication at multiple levels by a distinct mechanism. Briefly, Sox4 inhibits the production of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and most of the TLRs by binding to their promoters to attenuate gene transcription. In addition, Sox4 blocks the activities of the TLR/MyD88/IRAK4/TAK1 and TLR/TRIF/TRAF3/TBK1 pathways by repressing their key components. Moreover, Sox4 represses the activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) through interacting with IKKα/α, and attenuates NF-kB and IFN regulatory factors 3/7 (IRF3/7) abundances by promoting protein degradation. All these contributed to the down-regulation of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, leading to facilitate the viral replications. Therefore, we reveal a distinct mechanism by which viral pathogens evade host innate immunity and discover a key regulator in host defense.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host innate immunity regulation by Sox4 during viral infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: High cell density perfusion process for high yield of influenza A virus production using MDCK suspension cells.
Abstract: Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 μL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 μL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 × 10<sup>10</sup> virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness. KEY POINTS: • First MDCK suspension cell-based perfusion process for IAV produciton was established. • "Cell density effect" was overcome and process was intensified by reduction of medium use and automated process control. • The process achieved cell density over 40 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and virus yield over 4.37 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 μL).

Title: Genomic Evidence for Sequestration of Influenza A Virus Lineages in Sea Duck Host Species.
Abstract: Wild birds are considered the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) making them critical for IAV surveillance efforts. While sea ducks have played a role in novel IAV emergence events that threatened food security and public health, very few surveillance samples have been collected from sea duck hosts. From 2014-2018, we conducted surveillance focused in the Mississippi flyway, USA at locations where sea duck harvest has been relatively successful compared to our other sampling locations. Our surveillance yielded 1662 samples from sea ducks, from which we recovered 77 IAV isolates. Our analyses identified persistence of sea duck specific IAV lineages across multiple years. We also recovered sea duck origin IAVs containing an H4 gene highly divergent from the majority of North American H4-HA with clade node age of over 65 years. Identification of IAVs with long branch lengths is indicative of substantial genomic change consistent with persistence without detection by surveillance efforts. Sea ducks play a role in the movement and long-term persistence of IAVs and are likely harboring more undetected IAV diversity. Sea ducks should be a point of emphasis for future North American wild bird IAV surveillance efforts.
Relevant: False
Reason: Reports on influenza A virus lineage persistence in sea ducks but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N8) Virus Spread by Short- and Long-Range Transmission, France, 2016-17.
Abstract: We detected 3 genotypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) virus in France during winter 2016-17. Genotype A viruses caused dramatic economic losses in the domestic duck farm industry in southwestern France. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that genotype A viruses formed 5 distinct geographic clusters in southwestern France. In some clusters, local secondary transmission might have been started by a single introduction. The intensity of the viral spread seems to correspond to the density of duck holdings in each production area. To avoid the introduction of disease into an unaffected area, it is crucial that authorities limit the movements of potentially infected birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: Phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis of virus spread without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Influenza- and MCMV-induced memory CD8 T cells control respiratory vaccinia virus infection despite residence in distinct anatomical niches.
Abstract: Induction of memory CD8 T cells residing in peripheral tissues is of interest for T cell-based vaccines as these cells are located at mucosal and barrier sites and can immediately exert effector functions, thus providing protection in case of local pathogen encounter. Different memory CD8 T cell subsets patrol peripheral tissues, but it is unclear which subset is superior in providing protection upon secondary infections. We used influenza virus to induce predominantly tissue resident memory T cells or cytomegalovirus to elicit a large pool of effector-like memory cells in the lungs and determined their early protective capacity and mechanism of reactivation. Both memory CD8 T cell pools have unique characteristics with respect to their phenotype, localization, and maintenance. However, these distinct features do not translate into different capacities to control a respiratory vaccinia virus challenge in an antigen-specific manner, although differential activation mechanisms are utilized. While influenza-induced memory CD8 T cells respond to antigen by local proliferation, MCMV-induced memory CD8 T cells relocate from the vasculature into the tissue in an antigen-independent and partially chemokine-driven manner. Together these results bear relevance for the development of vaccines aimed at eliciting a protective memory CD8 T cell pool at mucosal sites.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on memory CD8 T cell responses to influenza and vaccinia virus infections without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A proposed molecular mechanism for pathogenesis of severe RNA-viral pulmonary infections.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Certain riboviruses can cause severe pulmonary complications leading to death in some infected patients. We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. <b>Methods:</b> Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N2), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. <b>Results:</b> Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. <b>Conclusions:</b> R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.

Title: Earliest detection to date of SARS-CoV-2 in Florida: Identification together with influenza virus on the main entry door of a university building, February 2020.
Abstract: In February and March, 2020, environmental surface swab samples were collected from the handle of the main entry door of a major university building in Florida, as part of a pilot surveillance project screening for influenza. Samples were taken at the end of regular classroom hours, between the dates of February 1-5 and February 19-March 4, 2020. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was isolated from the door handle on four of the 19 days sampled. Both SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in a sample collected on February 21, 2020. Based on sequence analysis, the Florida SARS-CoV-2 strain (designated UF-11) was identical to strains being identified in Washington state during the same time period, while the earliest similar sequences were sampled in China/Hubei between Dec 30th 2019 and Jan 5th 2020. The first human case of COVID-19 was not officially reported in Florida until March 1st. In an analysis of sequences from COVID-19 patients in this region of Florida, there was only limited evidence of subsequent dissemination of the UF-11 strain. Identical or highly similar strains, possibly related through a common transmission chain, were detected with increasing frequency in Washington state between end of February and beginning of March. Our data provide further documentation of the rapid early spread of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the likelihood that closely related strains were cryptically circulating in multiple U.S. communities before the first "official" cases were recognized.
Relevant: False

Title: Inducible Guanylate-Binding Protein 7 Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication by Suppressing Innate Immunity via NF-κB and JAK-STAT Signaling Pathways.
Abstract: Guanylate-binding protein 7 (GBP7) belongs to the GBP family, which plays key roles in mediating innate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Thus far, GBP7 has been reported to be a critical cellular factor against bacterial infection. However, the relationship between GBP7 and influenza A virus (IAV) replication is unknown. Here, we showed that GBP7 expression was significantly upregulated in the lungs of mice, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and A549 cells during IAV infection. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and overexpression approaches, it was found that GBP7 knockout inhibited IAV replication by enhancing the expression of IAV-induced type I interferon (IFN), type III IFN, and proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely, overexpression of GBP7 facilitated IAV replication by suppressing the expression of those factors. Furthermore, GBP7 knockout enhanced IAV-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and phosphorylation of stat1 and stat2; overexpression of GBP7 had the opposite effect. Our data indicated that GBP7 suppresses innate immune responses to IAV infection via NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Taken together, upon IAV infection, the induced GBP7 facilitated IAV replication by suppressing innate immune responses to IAV infection, which suggested that GBP7 serves as a therapeutic target for controlling IAV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> So far, few studies have mentioned the distinct function of guanylate-binding protein 7 (GBP7) on virus infection. Here, we reported that GBP7 expression was significantly upregulated in the lungs of mice, human PBMCs, and A549 cells during IAV infection. GBP7 facilitated IAV replication by suppressing the expression of type I interferon (IFN), type III IFN, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, it was indicated that GBP7 suppresses innate immune responses to IAV infection via NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Taken together, our results elucidate a critical role of GBP7 in the host immune system during IAV infection.

Title: Comparative virulence of seasonal viruses responsible for lower respiratory tract infections: a southern European multi-centre cohort study of hospital admissions.
Abstract: Our study aimed to compare the clinical severity of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI's) caused by Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of LRTI admissions with positive PCR results for Influenza or RSV from 2017 to 2019 in three teaching hospitals in southern Europe. Data on clinical characteristics, viral agents and disease outcome were collected. Nosocomial infection was excluded. Main outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death. A total of 984 patients were included. Median age was 75 years. Influenza A was the most frequently identified virus (56.5%), of which 27.1% were subtype H1N1 and 53.0% H3N2. Influenza B was isolated in 22.3% and RSV in 21.0%. There were 10.5% of patients who died during admission and 8.3% submitted to IMV. Influenza A H1N1 was associated with lower age and less co-morbidity, while the opposite was observed for RSV. Influenza A H1N1 was independently associated with both higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 2.0 [1.2-3.4] p = 0.008) and IMV (adjusted odds ratio 5.1 [3.0-8.5] p < 0.001). Influenza A H1N1 was an independent predictor of mortality and IMV. These findings may have implications on hospital resource planning and vaccination policies.

Abstract: A 9-year-old girl was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure due to influenza. Nine months earlier, she presented with unexplained lymphoedema of the lower extremities and monocytopenia. She had a history of occasional finger warts and onychomycoses. During hospitalisation, the patient was diagnosed with Emberger syndrome caused by GATA2 deficiency. The admission was complicated by thromboses in the right hand, leading to amputation of multiple fingers. From then on, the patient has been in good recovery, the function of her right hand was improving and an allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation has now been successfully performed.

Title: Effect of Antigenic Drift on Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the United States-2019-2020.
Abstract: At the start of the 2019-2020 influenza season, concern arose that circulating B/Victoria viruses of the globally emerging clade V1A.3 were antigenically drifted from the strain included in the vaccine. Intense B/Victoria activity was followed by circulation of genetically diverse A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were also antigenically drifted. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the United States against illness from these emerging viruses. We enrolled outpatients aged ≥6 months with acute respiratory illness at 5 sites. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using the test-negative design, we determined influenza VE by virus subtype/lineage and genetic subclades by comparing odds of vaccination in influenza cases versus test-negative controls. Among 8845 enrollees, 2722 (31%) tested positive for influenza, including 1209 (44%) for B/Victoria and 1405 (51%) for A(H1N1)pdm09. Effectiveness against any influenza illness was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32-44), 45% (95% CI: 37-52) against B/Victoria and 30% (95% CI: 21-39) against A(H1N1)pdm09-associated illness. Vaccination offered no protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with antigenically drifted clade 6B.1A 183P-5A+156K HA genes (VE 7%; 95% CI: -14 to 23%) which predominated after January. Vaccination provided protection against influenza illness, mainly due to infections from B/Victoria viruses. Vaccine protection against illness from A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower than historically observed effectiveness of 40%-60%, due to late-season vaccine mismatch following emergence of antigenically drifted viruses. The effect of drift on vaccine protection is not easy to predict and, even in drifted years, significant protection can be observed.

Title: Comparative in vitro analysis of inhibition of rhinovirus and influenza virus replication by mucoactive secretolytic agents and plant extracts.
Abstract: Rhinoviruses and influenza viruses cause millions of acute respiratory infections annually. Symptoms of mild acute respiratory infections are commonly treated with over-the-counter products like ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts today. Because the direct antiviral activity of these over-the-counter products has not been studied in a systematic way, the current study aimed to compare their inhibitory effect against rhinovirus and influenza virus replication in an in vitro setting. The cytotoxicity of ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts was analyzed in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and HeLa Ohio cells. The antiviral effect of these over-the-counter products was compared by analyzing the dose-dependent inhibition (i) of rhinovirus A2- and B14-induced cytopathic effect in HeLa Ohio cells and (ii) of influenza virus A/Hong Kong/68 (subtype H3N2)- and A/Jena/8178/09 (subtype H1N1, pandemic)-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. To get insights into the mechanism of action of pelargonium extract against influenza virus, we performed time-of-addition assays as well as hemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition assays. N-acetyl cysteine, thyme and pelargonium extract showed no or only marginal cytotoxicity in MDCK and HeLa Ohio cells in the tested concentration range. The 50% cytotoxic concentration of ambroxol and bromhexine was 51.85 and 61.24 μM, respectively. No anti-rhinoviral activity was detected at non-cytotoxic concentrations in this in vitro study setting. Ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine inhibited the influenza virus-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells no or less than 50%. In contrast, a dose-dependent anti-influenza virus activity of thyme and pelargonium extracts was demonstrated. The time-of addition assays revealed an inhibition of early and late steps of influenza virus replication by pelargonium extract whereas zanamivir acted on late steps only. The proven block of viral neuraminidase activity might explain the inhibition of influenza virus replication when added after viral adsorption. The study results indicate a distinct inhibition of influenza A virus replication by thyme and pelargonium extract which might contribute to the beneficial effects of these plant extracts on acute respiratory infections symptoms.

Title: Assessment of Maternal and Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load, Transplacental Antibody Transfer, and Placental Pathology in Pregnancies During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Abstract: Biological data are lacking with respect to risk of vertical transmission and mechanisms of fetoplacental protection in maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal and neonatal biofluids, transplacental passage of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and incidence of fetoplacental infection. This cohort study was conducted among pregnant women presenting for care at 3 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Women with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results positive for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from April 2 to June 13, 2020, and follow-up occurred through July 10, 2020. Contemporaneous participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as a convenience sample from pregnant women with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, defined by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. The main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal plasma or respiratory fluids and umbilical cord plasma, quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in maternal and cord plasma, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the placenta. Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 with RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [5.6] years) and 63 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [5.4] years) provided samples for analysis. Of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) were asymptomatic, 22 (34%) had mild disease, 7 (11%) had moderate disease, 10 (16%) had severe disease, and 2 (3%) had critical disease. In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested in whom SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified in cord blood, 1 had detectable immunoglobuilin M to nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any. In antibody analyses among 37 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G was detected in 24 women (65%) and anti-nucleocapsid was detected in 26 women (70%). Mother-to-neonate transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower than transfer of anti-influenza hemagglutinin A antibodies (mean [SD] cord-to-maternal ratio: anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G, 0.72 [0.57]; anti-nucleocapsid, 0.74 [0.44]; anti-influenza, 1.44 [0.80]; P < .001). Nonoverlapping placental expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 was noted. In this cohort study, there was no evidence of placental infection or definitive vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was inefficient. Lack of viremia and reduced coexpression and colocalization of placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve as protective mechanisms against vertical transmission.

Title: PAR1 regulation of CXCL1 expression and neutrophil recruitment to the lung in mice infected with influenza A virus.
Abstract: Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is expressed in various immune cells and in the lung. We showed that PAR1 plays a role in Coxsackievirus B3 infection by enhancing toll-like receptor 3-dependent interferon- <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>β</mi></math> expression in cardiac fibroblasts. We investigated the role of PAR1 in a mouse model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We used mice with either a global deficiency of PAR1, cell type-specific deficiencies of PAR1, or mutation of PAR1 at the R41 or R46 cleavage sites. PAR1-deficient mice had increased CXCL1 expression in the lung, increased neutrophil recruitment, increased protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and increased mortality after IAV infection compared with control mice infected with IAV. Results from mice with cell type-specific deletion of PAR1 indicated that PAR1 expression by hematopoietic cells suppressed CXCL1 expression, whereas PAR1 expression by endothelial cells enhanced CXCL1 expression in response to IAV infection. PAR1 activation also enhanced polyinosinic:polycytodylic acid induction of interleukin-8 in a human endothelial cell line. Mutation of the R46 cleavage site of PAR1 was associated with increased CXCL1 expression in the lung in response to IAV infection, which suggested that R46 signaling suppresses CXCL1 expression. These results indicate that PAR1 expression by different cell types and activation by different proteases modulates the immune response during IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates host immune receptor (PAR1) roles in influenza infection, focusing on host responses rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Metagenomic characterisation of additional and novel avian viruses from Australian wild ducks.
Abstract: Birds, notably wild ducks, are reservoirs of pathogenic and zoonotic viruses such as influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the current study, we used metagenomics to detect and characterise avian DNA and RNA viruses from wild Pacific black ducks, Chestnut teals and Grey teals collected at different time points from a single location. We characterised a likely new species of duck aviadenovirus and a novel duck gyrovirus. We also report what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first finding of an avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black ducks and a rotavirus F from Chestnut teals. Other viruses characterised from the samples from these wild ducks belong to the virus families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae. Some of the viruses may have potential cross-species transmissibility, while others indicated a wide genetic diversity of duck viruses within a genus. The study also showed evidence of potential transmission of viruses along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway; potentially facilitated by migrating shorebirds. The detection and characterisation of several avian viruses not previously described, and causing asymptomatic but potentially also symptomatic infections suggest the need for more virus surveillance studies for pathogenic and potential zoonotic viruses in wildlife reservoirs.

Reason: The paper reports metagenomic characterization of avian viruses from wild ducks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection: An in silico study.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 triggers a dysregulated innate immune system activation. As the mevalonate pathway (MVP) prevents the activation of inflammasomes and cytokine release and regulates endosomal transport, compromised signaling could be associated with the pathobiology of COVID-19. Prior transcriptomic studies of host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not reported to date the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the MVP. In this study, we accessed public data sets to report in silico investigations into gene expression. In addition, we proposed candidate genes that are thought to have a direct association with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and which may be dependent on signals derived from the MVP. Our results revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the MVP. These results were not found when investigating the gene expression data from host cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus, H1N1 influenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Our manually curated gene set showed significant gene expression variability in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as per Blanco-Melo et al. data set (GSE147507). In light of the present findings, SARS-CoV-2 could hijack the MVP, leading to hyperinflammatory responses. Prompt reconstitution of this pathway with available agents should be considered in future studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This in silico study analyzes host gene expression changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Re-Invasion of H5N8 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus Clade 2.3.4.4b in Hokkaido, Japan, 2020.
Abstract: Global dispersion of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI), especially that caused by H5 clade 2.3.4.4, has threatened poultry industries and, potentially, human health. An HPAI virus, A/northern pintail/Hokkaido/M13/2020 (H5N8) (NP/Hok/20) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, was isolated from a fecal sample collected at a lake in Hokkaido, Japan where migratory birds rested, October 2020. In the phylogenetic trees of all eight gene segments, NP/Hok/20 fell into in the cluster of European isolates in 2020, but was distinct from the isolates in eastern Asia and Europe during the winter season of 2017-2018. The antigenic cartography indicates that the antigenicity of NP/Hok/20 was almost the same as that of previous isolates of H5 clade 2.3.4.4b, whereas the antigenic distances from NP/Hok/20 to the representative strains in clade 2.3.4.4e and to a strain in 2.3.4 were apparently distant. These data imply that HPAI virus clade 2.3.4.4b should have been delivered by bird migration despite the intercontinental distance, although it was not defined whether NP/Hok/20 was transported from Europe via Siberia where migratory birds nest in the summer season. Given the probability of perpetuation of transmission in the northern territory, periodic updates of intensive surveys on avian influenza at the global level are essential to prepare for future outbreaks of the HPAI virus.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Clade 2.3.4.4b Subtype H5N8 Virus Isolated from Mandarin Duck in South Korea, 2020.
Abstract: In October 2020, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N8 virus was identified from a fecal sample of a wild mandarin duck (<i>Aix galericulata</i>) in South Korea. We sequenced all eight genome segments of the virus, designated as A/Mandarin duck/Korea/K20-551-4/2020(H5N8), and conducted genetic characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis to track its origin. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis show that the hemagglutinin gene belongs to H5 clade 2.3.4.4 subgroup B. All genes share high levels of nucleotide identity with H5N8 HPAI viruses identified from Europe during early 2020. Enhanced active surveillance in wild and domestic birds is needed to monitor the introduction and spread of HPAI via wild birds and to inform the design of improved prevention and control strategies.

Title: OP7, a novel influenza A virus defective interfering particle: production, purification, and animal experiments demonstrating antiviral potential.
Abstract: The novel influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particle "OP7" inhibits IAV replication in a co-infection and was previously suggested as a promising antiviral agent. Here, we report a batch-mode cell culture-based production process for OP7. In the present study, a seed virus containing standard virus (STV) and OP7 was used. The yield of OP7 strongly depended on the production multiplicity of infection. To inactivate infectious STV in the OP7 material, which may cause harm in a potential application, UV irradiation was used. The efficacy of OP7 in this material was preserved, as shown by an in vitro interference assay. Next, steric exclusion chromatography was used to purify and to concentrate (~ 13-fold) the UV-treated material. Finally, administration of produced OP7 material in mice did not show any toxic effects. Furthermore, all mice infected with a lethal dose of IAV survived the infection upon OP7 co-treatment. Thus, the feasibility of a production workflow for OP7 and its potential for antiviral treatment was demonstrated. KEY POINTS: • OP7 efficacy strongly depended on the multiplicity of infection used for production • Purification by steric exclusion chromatography increased OP7 efficacy • OP7-treated mice were protected against a lethal infection with IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on production and antiviral potential of a defective interfering particle without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Viral-induced alternative splicing of host genes promotes influenza replication.
Abstract: Viral infection induces the expression of numerous host genes that impact the outcome of infection. Here, we show that infection of human lung epithelial cells with influenza A virus (IAV) also induces a broad program of alternative splicing of host genes. Although these splicing-regulated genes are not enriched for canonical regulators of viral infection, we find that many of these genes do impact replication of IAV. Moreover, in several cases, specific inhibition of the IAV-induced splicing pattern also attenuates viral infection. We further show that approximately a quarter of the IAV-induced splicing events are regulated by hnRNP K, a host protein required for efficient splicing of the IAV M transcript in nuclear speckles. Finally, we find an increase in hnRNP K in nuclear speckles upon IAV infection, which may alter accessibility of hnRNP K for host transcripts thereby leading to a program of host splicing changes that promote IAV replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host gene alternative splicing induced by viral infection and its effect on viral replication, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Role of microRNA and Oxidative Stress in Influenza A Virus Pathogenesis.
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate diverse cellular pathways by controlling gene expression. Increasing evidence has revealed their critical involvement in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenesis. Host-IAV interactions induce different levels of oxidative stress (OS) by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant factors. It is thought that miRNA may regulate the expression of ROS; conversely, ROS can induce or suppress miRNA expression during IAV infection. Thus, miRNA and OS are the two key factors of IAV infection and pathogenesis. Accordingly, interactions between OS and miRNA during IAV infection might be a critical area for further research. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between miRNAs and OS during IAV infection. Additionally, we highlight the potential of miRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for IAV infections. This knowledge will help us to study host-virus interactions with novel intervention strategies.

Title: Influenza A virus protein PA-X suppresses host Ankrd17-mediated immune responses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) PA-X is a critical ribonuclease protein involved in host cell shutoff but its role in modulating the host immune response to IAV infection remains to be addressed. In this study, host cellular proteins that directly interact with PA-X were screened to investigate the biological function of PA-X in the pathogenesis of IAV infection. The protein ankyrin repeat domain 17 (Ankrd17), a positive regulator of inflammatory responses via the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, was identified as a specific PA-X binding partner that preferred PA-X to the PA protein. The N-terminal ankyrin repeats of Ankrd17 are the key domain for the interaction with PA-X rather than PA, which is required for the function of Ankrd17 in elevating the host immune response. Using Ankrd17 knockout and overexpression, we confirmed that PA-X significantly affected the Ankrd17-mediated response to infection in host cells. Our data therefore reveal a novel function for PA-X in the regulation of innate immune pathways via the interaction between PA-X and Ankrd17.

Title: Characterising the epidemic spread of influenza A/H3N2 within a city through phylogenetics.
Abstract: Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. While we did not find that transmission dynamics in Basel correlate with humidity or school closures, we did find some evidence that it may positively correlated with temperature. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network. In the remaining transmission network, our analyses suggest that school-aged children likely play a more central role than pre-school aged children. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.
Relevant: False

Title: Effects of serum amyloid protein A on influenza A virus replication and viral interactions with neutrophils.
Abstract: Innate immunity is vital for the early control of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Serum amyloid A (SAA1) is an acute phase reactant produced in the liver and lung that rises dramatically during IAV infection. The potential role of SAA1 in host defense against IAV is unknown. SAA1 has been reported to directly activate neutrophils and to recruit them to the lung during infectious and inflammatory processes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cell recruited to the lung in the early phase of IAV infection. There are different forms and preparations of SAA1 that have found to have different effects on phagocyte responses, through various receptors. In this paper, we test the direct effects of various preparations of serum derived or recombinant SAA on IAV and how it modulates the interactions of IAV with neutrophils. All SAA preparations bound to IAV in vitro but caused minimal hemagglutination inhibition or viral aggregation. The human serum-derived SAA1 or the complex of SAA1 with HDL did have IAV neutralizing activity in vitro, whereas the recombinant SAA1 preparations did not. We found that different SAA preparations also had markedly different effects on neutrophil functions, with E. coli-derived SAA1 triggering some responses in neutrophils on its own or in presence of IAV whereas mammalian cell-derived SAA1 did not. This discrepancy could be explained by the reported contamination of the former preparation with bacterial components. Of interest, however, serum SAA alone, serum SAA complexed with HDL, or HDL alone potentiated some neutrophil responses to IAV. Our results suggest that SAA may play some role in host response to IAV, but further work needs to be done to clarify the role of different variants of SAA alone or complexed with HDL.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates effects of serum amyloid A on virus and neutrophil interactions without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Innate Immunity and Influenza A Virus Pathogenesis: Lessons for COVID-19.
Abstract: There is abundant evidence that the innate immune response to influenza A virus (IAV) is highly complex and plays a key role in protection against IAV induced infection and illness. Unfortunately it also clear that aspects of innate immunity can lead to severe morbidity or mortality from IAV, including inflammatory lung injury, bacterial superinfection, and exacerbation of reactive airways disease. We review broadly the virus and host factors that result in adverse outcomes from IAV and show evidence that inflammatory responses can become damaging even apart from changes in viral replication <i>per se</i>, with special focus on the positive and adverse effects of neutrophils and monocytes. We then evaluate in detail the role of soluble innate inhibitors including surfactant protein D and antimicrobial peptides that have a potential dual capacity for down-regulating viral replication and also inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses and how these innate host factors could possibly be harnessed to treat IAV infection. Where appropriate we draw comparisons and contrasts the SARS-CoV viruses and IAV in an effort to point out where the extensive knowledge existing regarding severe IAV infection could help guide research into severe COVID 19 illness or vice versa.

Title: Dynamic metabolic reprogramming in dendritic cells: An early response to influenza infection that is essential for effector function.
Abstract: Infection with the influenza virus triggers an innate immune response that initiates the adaptive response to halt viral replication and spread. However, the metabolic response fueling the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in innate immune cell homeostasis remain undefined. Although influenza increases parasitized cell metabolism, it does not productively replicate in dendritic cells. To dissect these mechanisms, we compared the metabolism of dendritic cells to that of those infected with active and inactive influenza A virus and those treated with toll-like receptor agonists. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, pulse chase substrate utilization assays and metabolic flux measurements, we found global metabolic changes in dendritic cells 17 hours post infection, including significant changes in carbon commitment via glycolysis and glutaminolysis, as well as mitochondrial respiration. Influenza infection of dendritic cells led to a metabolic phenotype distinct from that induced by TLR agonists, with significant resilience in terms of metabolic plasticity. We identified c-Myc as one transcription factor modulating this response. Restriction of c-Myc activity or mitochondrial substrates significantly changed the immune functions of dendritic cells, such as reducing motility and T cell activation. Transcriptome analysis of inflammatory dendritic cells isolated following influenza infection showed similar metabolic reprogramming occurs in vivo. Thus, early in the infection process, dendritic cells respond with global metabolic restructuring, that is present in inflammatory lung dendritic cells after infection, and this is important for effector function. These findings suggest metabolic switching in dendritic cells plays a vital role in initiating the immune response to influenza infection.

Title: MicroRNA-206 inhibits influenza A virus replication by targeting tankyrase 2.
Abstract: Due to the frequent mutations, influenza A virus (IAV) becomes resistant to anti-viral drugs targeting influenza viral proteins. There are increasing interests in anti-viral agents that target host cellular proteins required for virus replication. Tankyrase (TNKS) has poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and is a negative regulator of many host proteins. The objectives of this study are to study the role of TNKS2 in IAV infection, identify the microRNAs targeting TNKS2, and to understand the mechanisms involved. We found that TNKS2 expression was elevated in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lungs during IAV infection. Knock-down of TNKS2 by RNA interference reduced viral replication. Using a computation approach and 3'-untranslation regions (3'-UTR) reporter assay, we identified miR-206 as the microRNA that targeted TNKS2. Overexpression of miR-206 reduced viral protein levels and virus production in cell culture. The effect of miR-206 on IAV replication was strain-independent. miR-206 activated JNK/c-Jun signalling, induced type I interferon expression and enhanced Stat signalling. Finally, the delivery of an adenovirus expressing miR-206 into the lung of mice challenged with IAV increased type I interferon response, suppressed viral load in the lungs and increased survival. Our results indicate that miR-206 has anti-influenza activity by targeting TNKS2 and subsequently activating the anti-viral state.

Title: Semisynthetic Cardenolides Acting as Antiviral Inhibitors of Influenza A Virus Replication by Preventing Polymerase Complex Formation.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections represent a major public health issue by causing annual epidemics and occasional pandemics that affect thousands of people worldwide. Vaccination is the main prophylaxis to prevent these epidemics/pandemics, although the effectiveness of licensed vaccines is rather limited due to the constant mutations of influenza virus antigenic characteristics. The available anti-influenza drugs are still restricted and there is an increasing viral resistance to these compounds, thus highlighting the need for research and development of new antiviral drugs. In this work, two semisynthetic derivatives of digitoxigenin, namely <b>C10</b> (3β-((<i>N</i>-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoacetyl)amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin) and <b>C11</b> (3β-(hydroxyacetyl)amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin), showed anti-influenza A virus activity by affecting the expression of viral proteins at the early and late stages of replication cycle, and altering the transcription and synthesis of new viral proteins, thereby inhibiting the formation of new virions. Such antiviral action occurred due to the interference in the assembly of viral polymerase, resulting in an impaired polymerase activity and, therefore, reducing viral replication. Confirming the in vitro results, a clinically relevant ex vivo model of influenza virus infection of human tumor-free lung tissues corroborated the potential of these compounds, especially <b>C10,</b> to completely abrogate influenza A virus replication at the highest concentration tested (2.0 µM). Taken together, these promising results demonstrated that <b>C10</b> and <b>C11</b> can be considered as potential new anti-influenza drug candidates.

Title: Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 1 Delta Inhibits the Nuclear Import of the Nucleoprotein and PA-PB1 Heterodimer of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) of the influenza A virus (IAV) is responsible for the viral RNA transcription and replication in the nucleus, and its functions rely on host factors. Previous studies have indicated that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta (eEF1D) may associate with RNP subunits, but its roles in IAV replication are unclear. Herein, we showed that eEF1D was an inhibitor of IAV replication because knockout of eEF1D resulted in a significant increase in virus yield. eEF1D interacted with RNP subunits polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2), and also with nucleoprotein (NP) in an RNA-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that eEF1D impeded the nuclear import of NP and PA-PB1 heterodimer of IAV, thereby suppressing the vRNP assembly, viral polymerase activity, and viral RNA synthesis. Together, our studies demonstrate eEF1D negatively regulating the IAV replication by inhibition of the nuclear import of RNP subunits, which not only uncovers a novel role of eEF1D in IAV replication but also provides new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear import of vRNP proteins.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus is the major cause of influenza, a respiratory disease in humans and animals. Different from most other RNA viruses, the transcription and replication of IAV occur in the cell nucleus. Therefore, the vRNPs must be imported into the nucleus for viral transcription and replication, which requires participation of host proteins. However, the mechanisms of the IAV-host interactions involved in nuclear import remain poorly understood. Here, we identified eEF1D as a novel inhibitor for the influenza virus life cycle. Importantly, eEF1D impaired the interaction between NP and importin α5 and the interaction between PB1 and RanBP5, which impeded the nuclear import of vRNP. Our studies not only reveal the molecular mechanisms of the nuclear import of IAV vRNP but also provide potential anti-influenza targets for antiviral development.
Relevant: False

Title: Analysis of the microRNA expression profiles of chicken dendritic cells in response to H9N2 avian influenza virus infection.
Abstract: MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a key role in virus-host interactions. Here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine cellular miRNA expression profiles in chicken dendritic cells infected with H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV). A total of 66 known and 36 novel miRNAs were differently expressed upon H9N2 infection, including 72 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated miRNAs. Functional analysis showed that the predicted targets of these miRNAs were significantly enriched in several pathways including endocytosis, notch, lysosome, p53, RIG-I-like and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. These data provide valuable information for further investigating the roles of miRNA in AIV pathogenesis and host defense response.

Title: Influenza Hemagglutinin Head Domain Mimicry by Rational Design.
Abstract: Despite diligent vaccination efforts, influenza virus infection remains a major cause for respiratory-related illness across the globe. The less-than-optimal immunity conferred by the currently prescribed seasonal vaccines and protracted production times warrant the development of novel vaccines. Induction of an epitope-focused antibody response targeting known neutralization epitopes is a viable strategy to enhance the breadth of protection against rapidly evolving infectious viruses. We report the development of a design framework to mimic the hemagglutinin (HA) head fragment of H1-subtype viruses by delineating the interaction network of invariant residues lining the receptor binding site (RBS); a site targeted by cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. The incorporation of multiple sequence alignment information in our algorithm to fix the construct termini and engineer rational mutations facilitates the facile extension of the design to heterologous (subtype-specific) influenza strains. We evaluated our design protocol by generating head fragments from divergent influenza A H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and pH1N1 A/California/07/2009 strains that share a sequence identity of only 74.4% within the HA1 subunit. The designed immunogens exhibited characteristics of a well-ordered protein, and bound conformation-specific RBS targeting antibodies with high affinity, a desirable feature for putative vaccine candidates. Additionally, the bacterial expression of these immunogens provides a low-cost, rapidly scalable alternative.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes design of hemagglutinin head domain mimics for vaccine development, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Cellular co-infection can modulate the efficiency of influenza A virus production and shape the interferon response.
Abstract: During viral infection, the numbers of virions infecting individual cells can vary significantly over time and space. The functional consequences of this variation in cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) remain poorly understood. Here, we rigorously quantify the phenotypic consequences of cellular MOI during influenza A virus (IAV) infection over a single round of replication in terms of cell death rates, viral output kinetics, interferon and antiviral effector gene transcription, and superinfection potential. By statistically fitting mathematical models to our data, we precisely define specific functional forms that quantitatively describe the modulation of these phenotypes by MOI at the single cell level. To determine the generality of these functional forms, we compare two distinct cell lines (MDCK cells and A549 cells), both infected with the H1N1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8). We find that a model assuming that infected cell death rates are independent of cellular MOI best fits the experimental data in both cell lines. We further observe that a model in which the rate and efficiency of virus production increase with cellular co-infection best fits our observations in MDCK cells, but not in A549 cells. In A549 cells, we also find that induction of type III interferon, but not type I interferon, is highly dependent on cellular MOI, especially at early timepoints. This finding identifies a role for cellular co-infection in shaping the innate immune response to IAV infection. Finally, we show that higher cellular MOI is associated with more potent superinfection exclusion, thus limiting the total number of virions capable of infecting a cell. Overall, this study suggests that the extent of cellular co-infection by influenza viruses may be a critical determinant of both viral production kinetics and cellular infection outcomes in a host cell type-dependent manner.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies effects of cellular co-infection on viral production and interferon response, focusing on host cell infection dynamics rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 and influenza: a comparative overview and treatment implications.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Alphainfluenzavirus are RNA viruses that cause coronavirus disease-19 and influenza, respectively. Both viruses infect the respiratory tract, show similar symptoms, and use surface proteins to infect the host. Influenza requires hemagglutinin and neuraminidase to infect, whereas SARS-CoV-2 uses protein S. Both viruses depend on a viral RNA polymerase to express their proteins, but only SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading mechanism, which results in a low mutation rate compared to influenza. E1KC4 and camostat mesylate are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, achieving an effect similar to oseltamivir. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate, nucleoside analogs have been developed (such as EIDD-2801), which insert lethal mutations in the viral RNA. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate suggests that a vaccine, as well as the immunity developed in recovered patients, could provide long-lasting protection compared to vaccines against influenza, which are rendered obsolete as the virus mutates.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a comparative overview of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses and treatment implications, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: Pathology of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus of clade 2.3.2.1a in turkeys in Bangladesh.
Abstract: A mixed-aged flock of 130 turkeys in Bangladesh reported the sudden death of 1 bird in September 2017. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in 3 turkeys, and phylogenetic analysis placed the viruses in the reassortant clade 2.3.2.1a. The birds had clinical signs of depression, diarrhea, weakness, closed eyes, and finally death. The mortality rate of the flock was 13% over the 6 d prior to the flock being euthanized. At autopsy, we observed congestion in lungs and brain, hemorrhages in the trachea, pancreas, breast muscle, coronary fat, intestine, bursa of Fabricius, and kidneys. Histopathology revealed hemorrhagic pneumonia, hemorrhages in the liver and kidneys, and hemorrhages and necrosis in the spleen and pancreas. Significant changes in the brain included gliosis, focal encephalomalacia and encephalitis, and neuronophagia.

Title: In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Activity of Gingerenone A on Influenza A Virus Is Mediated by Targeting Janus Kinase 2.
Abstract: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed as novel immunomodulatory drugs and primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have suggested that this category of anti-inflammatory drugs could be potentially useful for the control of inflammation "storms" in respiratory virus infections. In addition to their role in regulating immune cell functions, JAK1 and JAK2 have been recently identified as crucial cellular factors involved in influenza A virus (IAV) replication and could be potentially targeted for antiviral therapy. Gingerenone A (Gin A) is a compound derived from ginger roots and a dual inhibitor of JAK2 and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1). Our present study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of Gin A on influenza A virus (IAV) and to understand its mechanisms of action. Here, we reported that Gin A suppressed the replication of three IAV subtypes (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2) in four cell lines. IAV replication was also inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK inhibitor, but not by PF-4708671, an S6K1 inhibitor. JAK2 overexpression enhanced H5N1 virus replication and attenuated Gin A-mediated antiviral activity. In vivo experiments revealed that Gin A treatment suppressed IAV replication in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice, alleviated their body weight loss, and prolonged their survival. Our study suggests that Gin A restricts IAV replication by inhibiting JAK2 activity; Gin A could be potentially useful for the control of influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates antiviral activity of a compound targeting a host kinase affecting influenza replication, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: In Vitro Combinations of Baloxavir Acid and Other Inhibitors against Seasonal Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Two antiviral classes, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) can be used to prevent and treat influenza infections during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. However, prolonged treatment may lead to the emergence of drug resistance. Therapeutic combinations constitute an alternative to prevent resistance and reduce antiviral doses. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro combinations of baloxavir acid (BXA) and other approved drugs against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) subtypes. The determination of an effective concentration inhibiting virus cytopathic effects by 50% (EC50) for each drug and combination indexes (CIs) were based on cell viability. CompuSyn software was used to determine synergism, additivity or antagonism between drugs. Combinations of BXA and NAIs or favipiravir had synergistic effects on cell viability against the two influenza A subtypes. Those effects were confirmed using a physiological and predictive ex vivo reconstructed human airway epithelium model. On the other hand, the combination of BXA and ribavirin showed mixed results. Overall, BXA stands as a good candidate for combination with several existing drugs, notably oseltamivir and favipiravir, to improve in vitro antiviral activity. These results should be considered for further animal and clinical evaluations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates in vitro drug combinations against influenza viruses, focusing on antiviral efficacy rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Inhibitory Activity of Honeysuckle Extracts against Influenza A Virus In Vitro and In Vivo.
Abstract: Honeysuckle has been used in the treatment of influenza virus infection for thousands of years in China. However, its main active components and the functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, four honeysuckle extracts, including acids extract, flavonoids extract, total extract and acids-flavonoids mixture, were prepared to clarify the main active antiviral components. The cytopathic effect reduction assay showed that all the four extracts inhibited the replication of influenza viruses H1N1, H3N2 and the oseltamivir-resistant mutant strain H1N1-H275Y. The acids-flavonoids mixture had the strongest inhibitory effects in vitro with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.8, 4.1, and > 20 μg/mL against H1N1, H3N2 and H1N1-H275Y, respectively, showing competitive antiviral activity with oseltamivir and ribavirin. Honeysuckle acids extract also showed the most significant antiviral activity in vivo. Oral administration of the acids extract at a dosage of 600 mg/kg/d effectively alleviated viral pneumonia, maintained body weight and improved the survival rate to 30% of the mice infected with a lethal dose of H1N1. The results of time-of-drug addition experiment and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay showed that honeysuckle extracts had a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect against influenza virus NAs. The flavonoid extract showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the NA of influenza virus H7N9 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 24.7 μg/mL. These results suggested that these extracts might exert their antiviral activity by suppressing the release of influenza viruses. Briefly, our findings demonstrate that acids and flavonoids extracts of honeysuckle are the major antiviral active components, and the acids extract has the potential to be developed into an antiviral agent against influenza virus, especially for oseltamivir-resistant viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of honeysuckle extracts against influenza virus, focusing on antiviral effects rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Systemic and respiratory T-cells induced by seasonal H1N1 influenza protect against pandemic H2N2 in ferrets.
Abstract: Traditional influenza vaccines primarily induce a narrow antibody response that offers no protection against heterosubtypic infections. Murine studies have shown that T cells can protect against a broad range of influenza strains. However, ferrets are a more potent model for studying immune correlates of protection in influenza infection. We therefore set out to investigate the role of systemic and respiratory T cells in the protection against heterosubtypic influenza A infections in ferrets. H1N1-priming induced systemic and respiratory T cells that responded against pandemic H2N2 and correlated with reduced viral replication and disease. CD8-positive T cell responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract were exceptionally high. We additionally confirmed that H2N2-responsive T cells are present in healthy human blood donors. These findings underline the importance of the T cell response in influenza immunity and show that T cells are a potent target for future universal influenza vaccines.
Relevant: False

Title: A Mutation Network Method for Transmission Analysis of Human Influenza H3N2.
Abstract: Characterizing the spatial transmission pattern is critical for better surveillance and control of human influenza. Here, we propose a mutation network framework that utilizes network theory to study the transmission of human influenza H3N2. On the basis of the mutation network, the transmission analysis captured the circulation pattern from a global simulation of human influenza H3N2. Furthermore, this method was applied to explore, in detail, the transmission patterns within Europe, the United States, and China, revealing the regional spread of human influenza H3N2. The mutation network framework proposed here could facilitate the understanding, surveillance, and control of other infectious diseases.

Title: Comparative Review of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Influenza A Respiratory Viruses.
Abstract: The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a global health emergency. The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: What is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible is SARS-CoV-2? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for viral infection? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, we performed a comparative study of four pathogenic viruses that primarily attack the respiratory system and may cause death, namely, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 strains). This comparative study provides a critical evaluation of the origin, genomic features, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, this evaluation may inform public health administrators and medical experts to aid in curbing the pandemic's progression.

Title: Thapsigargin at Non-Cytotoxic Levels Induces a Potent Host Antiviral Response that Blocks Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a major global pathogen of humans, and there is an unmet need for effective antivirals. Current antivirals against influenza A virus directly target the virus and are vulnerable to mutational resistance. Harnessing an effective host antiviral response is an attractive alternative. We show that brief exposure to low, non-toxic doses of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump, promptly elicits an extended antiviral state that dramatically blocks influenza A virus production. Crucially, oral administration of TG protected mice against lethal virus infection and reduced virus titres in the lungs of treated mice. TG-induced ER stress unfolded protein response appears as a key driver responsible for activating a spectrum of host antiviral defences that include an enhanced type I/III interferon response. Our findings suggest that TG is potentially a viable host-centric antiviral for the treatment of influenza A virus infection without the inherent problem of drug resistance.

Title: Primary Swine Respiratory Epithelial Cell Lines for the Efficient Isolation and Propagation of Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza virus isolation from clinical samples is critical for the identification and characterization of circulating and emerging viruses. Yet efficient isolation can be difficult. In these studies, we isolated primary swine nasal and tracheal respiratory epithelial cells and immortalized swine nasal epithelial cells (siNEC) and tracheal epithelial cells (siTEC) that retained the abilities to form tight junctions and cilia and to differentiate at the air-liquid interface like primary cells. Critically, both human and swine influenza viruses replicated in the immortalized cells, which generally yielded higher-titer viral isolates from human and swine nasal swabs, supported the replication of isolates that failed to grow in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and resulted in fewer dominating mutations during viral passaging than MDCK cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Robust <i>in vitro</i> culture systems for influenza virus are critically needed. MDCK cells, the most widely used cell line for influenza isolation and propagation, do not adequately model the respiratory tract. Therefore, many clinical isolates, both animal and human, are unable to be isolated and characterized, limiting our understanding of currently circulating influenza viruses. We have developed immortalized swine respiratory epithelial cells that retain the ability to differentiate and can support influenza replication and isolation. These cell lines can be used as additional tools to enhance influenza research and vaccine development.

Title: Avian Influenza Virus Prevalence and Subtype Diversity in Wild Birds in Shanghai, China, 2016-2018.
Abstract: From 2016 to 2018, surveillance of influenza A viruses in wild birds was conducted in Shanghai, located at the East Asian-Australian flyway, China. A total of 5112 samples from 51 species of wild birds were collected from three different wetlands. The total three-year prevalence of influenza A viruses among them was 8.8%, as assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, and the total prevalence was higher in Anseriformes (26.3%) than in the Charadriiformes (2.3%) and the other orders (2.4%) in the Chongmin wetlands. Anseriformes should be the key monitoring group in future surveillance efforts. The peak prevalence of influenza A viruses in Charadriiformes were in April and September, and in other bird orders, the peaks were in November and December. Twelve subtypes of haemagglutinin (HA; H1-H12) and eight subtypes of neuraminidase (NA; N1, N2, N4-N9) were identified in 21 different combinations. The greatest subtype diversity could be found in common teal, suggesting that this species of the bird might play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of influenza A viruses in Shanghai. These results will increase our understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of influenza A viruses in wild bird hosts in eastern China, and provide references for subsequent surveillance of influenza A virus in wild birds in this area.

Title: Neuro-ophthalmological consequences of acute influenza A encephalitis in a genetically predisposed child.
Abstract: Acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare disease that corresponds to a rapidly progressive encephalopathy induced by a viral infection. It is frequently associated with a mutation on the RAN-binding protein 2 (<i>RANBP2</i>) gene-ANE1. We present a case of a 5-year-old boy with a clinical picture of influenza aggravated to an acute encephalopathy picture after the 3rd day. Complementary examinations came back positive for the influenza A virus, and MRI showed aspects compatible with ANE. He was treated accordingly with subsequent improvement of the clinical picture. During ambulatory follow-up, a mutation was detected on the <i>RANBP2</i> gene and, at the ophthalmological level, bilateral peripheral constriction on the campimetry and a significant reduction of bilateral peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer was reported. Our case contributes to the enrichment of the neuro-ophthalmological literature and expands the spectrum of sequelae of this rare entity in the Caucasian population.

Title: Avian Influenza Viruses Detected in Birds in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: In the recent past, sub-Saharan Africa has not escaped the devastating effects of avian influenza virus (AIV) in poultry and wild birds. This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past two decades (2000-2019). We collected data from three electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1% to 7.1%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 5.237, <i>p</i> = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, <i>p</i> = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8 and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1 and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.

Title: Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal in Measurably Evolving Populations.
Abstract: Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.

Title: Log Transformation Improves Dating of Phylogenies.
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees inferred from sequence data often have branch lengths measured in the expected number of substitutions and therefore, do not have divergence times estimated. These trees give an incomplete view of evolutionary histories since many applications of phylogenies require time trees. Many methods have been developed to convert the inferred branch lengths from substitution unit to time unit using calibration points, but none is universally accepted as they are challenged in both scalability and accuracy under complex models. Here, we introduce a new method that formulates dating as a nonconvex optimization problem where the variance of log-transformed rate multipliers is minimized across the tree. On simulated and real data, we show that our method, wLogDate, is often more accurate than alternatives and is more robust to various model assumptions.

Title: Immune response of polarized cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells infected with Influenza A virus.
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is characterized by dysfunction of the immune response in the airway epithelium that leads to prolonged infection, colonization and exacerbated inflammation. In this study, we determined the gene expression profile of airway epithelial cells knockdown for CFTR (CFTR KD) in response to bacterial and viral challenges. In a first approach, polarized CFTR KD and their control counterpart (CFTR CTL) cells were stimulated with P. aeruginosa-derived virulence factor flagellin. Next, we developed a model of Influenza A virus (IAV) infection in CTL and CFTR KD polarized cells. mRNA was collected for transcriptome analysis. Beside the expected pro-inflammatory response, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted key molecular pathways and players involved in IAV and anti-viral interferon signaling. Although IAV replication was similar in both cell types, multiplex gene expression analysis revealed changes of key immune genes dependent on time of infection that were found to be CFTR-dependent and/or IAV-dependent. Interferons are key signaling proteins/cytokines in the antibacterial and antiviral response. To evaluate their impact on the altered gene expression profile in CFTR responses to pathogens, we measured transcriptome changes after exposure to Type I-, Type II- and Type III-interferons. Our findings reveal target genes in understanding the defective immune response in the CF airway epithelium in the context of viral infection. Information provided in this study would be useful to understand the dysfunctional immune response of the CF airway epithelium during infection.

Title: Unaltered influenza disease outcomes in swine prophylactically treated with α-galactosylceramide.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are a major cause of respiratory diseases in pigs. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are an innate-like T cell subset that contribute significantly to IAV resistance in mice. In the current work, we explored whether expanding and activating iNKT cells with the iNKT cell superagonist α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) would change the course of an IAV infection in pigs. In one study, α-GalCer was administered to pigs intramuscularly (i.m.) 9 days before infection, which systemically expanded iNKT cells. In another study, α-GalCer was administered intranasally (i.n.) 2 days before virus infection to activate mucosal iNKT cells. Despite a synergistic increase in iNKT cells when α-GalCer i.m. treated pigs were infected with IAV, neither approach reduced disease signs, lung pathology, or virus replication. Our results indicate that prophylactic use of iNKT cell agonists to prevent IAV infection is ineffective in pigs. This is significant because this type of approach has been considered for humans whose iNKT cell levels and IAV infections are more similar to those of pigs than mice.
Relevant: False

Title: A broad-spectrum virus- and host-targeting peptide against respiratory viruses including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: The 2019 novel respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 with rapid global socioeconomic disruptions and disease burden to healthcare. The COVID-19 and previous emerging virus outbreaks highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we show that a defensin-like peptide P9R exhibited potent antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses that require endosomal acidification for virus infection, including the enveloped pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), and the non-enveloped rhinovirus. P9R can significantly protect mice from lethal challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and shows low possibility to cause drug-resistant virus. Mechanistic studies indicate that the antiviral activity of P9R depends on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification, which provides a proof of concept that virus-binding alkaline peptides can broadly inhibit pH-dependent viruses. These results suggest that the dual-functional virus- and host-targeting P9R can be a promising candidate for combating pH-dependent respiratory viruses.

Title: SNW1 interacts with IKKγ to positively regulate antiviral innate immune responses against influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The Ski-interacting protein (SNW1) acts as a transcriptional co-regulator associated with mRNA splicing and transcription, cell cycle progression, acute and chronic inflammatory responses, however, its role involved in host antiviral innate immune responses remains to be explored. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that SNW1 positively regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon (IFN) responses induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection, and further inhibits virus replication by performing SNW1 depletion or overexpression approaches. Furthermore, we showed that reduced interferon beta (IFN-β) expression caused by interfering SNW1 impairs the activation of JAK-STAT pathway in response to IAV or poly I:C. Importantly, by interacting with IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of IκB kinase (IKK) complex, SNW1 promotes IAV-induced activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of TBK1 kinase, leading to the increase of antiviral effectors interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), IFN-β and myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1). Taken together, our study revealed that SNW1 is an important mediator of host defenses against IAV through the induction of pro-inflammatory factors and IFN signaling, providing novel insights in modulating innate immune responses to protect host from IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of host protein SNW1 in antiviral immune responses to influenza A virus infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The pneumococcal two-component system SirRH is linked to enhanced intracellular survival of Streptococcus pneumoniae in influenza-infected pulmonary cells.
Abstract: The virus-bacterial synergism implicated in secondary bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae following infection with epidemic or pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) is well documented. However, the molecular mechanisms behind such synergism remain largely ill-defined. In pneumocytes infected with influenza A virus, subsequent infection with S. pneumoniae leads to enhanced pneumococcal intracellular survival. The pneumococcal two-component system SirRH appears essential for such enhanced survival. Through comparative transcriptomic analysis between the ΔsirR and wt strains, a list of 179 differentially expressed genes was defined. Among those, the clpL protein chaperone gene and the psaB Mn+2 transporter gene, which are involved in the stress response, are important in enhancing S. pneumoniae survival in influenza-infected cells. The ΔsirR, ΔclpL and ΔpsaB deletion mutants display increased susceptibility to acidic and oxidative stress and no enhancement of intracellular survival in IAV-infected pneumocyte cells. These results suggest that the SirRH two-component system senses IAV-induced stress conditions and controls adaptive responses that allow survival of S. pneumoniae in IAV-infected pneumocytes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on bacterial gene regulation (SirRH system) affecting bacterial survival in influenza-infected cells, without explicit links between viral genotypes and viral phenotypes.

Title: Cell type- and replication stage-specific influenza virus responses in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) remain a significant global health burden. Activation of the innate immune response is important for controlling early virus replication and spread. It is unclear how early IAV replication events contribute to immune detection. Additionally, while many cell types in the lung can be infected, it is not known if all cell types contribute equally to establish the antiviral state in the host. Here, we use single-cycle influenza A viruses (scIAVs) to characterize the early immune response to IAV in vitro and in vivo. We found that the magnitude of virus replication contributes to antiviral gene expression within infected cells prior to the induction of a global response. We also developed a scIAV that is only capable of undergoing primary transcription, the earliest stage of virus replication. Using this tool, we uncovered replication stage-specific responses in vitro and in vivo. Using several innate immune receptor knockout cell lines, we identify RIG-I as the predominant antiviral detector of primary virus transcription and amplified replication in vitro. Through a Cre-inducible reporter mouse, we used scIAVs expressing Cre-recombinase to characterize cell type-specific responses in vivo. Individual cell types upregulate unique sets of antiviral genes in response to both primary virus transcription and amplified replication. We also identified antiviral genes that are only upregulated in response to direct infection. Altogether, these data offer insight into the early mechanisms of antiviral gene activation during influenza A infection.

Title: Rethinking Gain-of-Function Experiments in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Abstract: Proponents of the use of gain-of-function (GOF) experiments with pathogens with pandemic potential (PPP) have argued that such experiments are necessary because they reveal important facets of pathogenesis and can be performed safely. Opponents of GOF experiments with PPP have argued that the risks outweigh the knowledge gained.

Title: Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH are broad-spectrum antivirals against RNA viruses including newly-emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of human DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor so far with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 17 nmol/L and an SI value of 10,505.88 in infected cells. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knock-out cells. This work demonstrates that both S312/S416 and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-regulation may have clinical potentials to cure SARS-CoV-2 or other RNA viruses circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses are mutated or not.

Title: Topoisomerase III-β is required for efficient replication of positive-sense RNA viruses.
Abstract: Based on genome-scale loss-of-function screens we discovered that Topoisomerase III-β (TOP3B), a human topoisomerase that acts on DNA and RNA, is required for yellow fever virus and dengue virus-2 replication. Remarkably, we found that TOP3B is required for efficient replication of all positive-sense-single stranded RNA viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2. While there are no drugs that specifically inhibit this topoisomerase, we posit that TOP3B is an attractive anti-viral target.

Title: Impaired phagocytic function in CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages prevents muscle recovery after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia in old mice.
Abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction in survivors of pneumonia disproportionately affects older individuals in whom it causes substantial morbidity. We found that skeletal muscle recovery was impaired in old compared with young mice after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. In young mice, recovery of muscle loss was associated with expansion of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages and downregulation of MHC II expression, followed by a proliferation of muscle satellite cells. These findings were absent in old mice and in mice deficient in Cx3cr1. Transcriptomic profiling of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages from old compared with young mice showed downregulation of pathways associated with phagocytosis and proteostasis, and persistent upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Consistently, skeletal muscle macrophages from old mice failed to downregulate MHCII expression during recovery from influenza A virus-induced pneumonia and showed impaired phagocytic function in vitro. Like old animals, mice deficient in the phagocytic receptor Mertk showed no macrophage expansion, MHCII downregulation, or satellite cell proliferation and failed to recover skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia.

Title: A pooled genome-wide screening strategy to identify and rank influenza host restriction factors in cell-based vaccine production platforms.
Abstract: Cell-derived influenza vaccines provide better protection and a host of other advantages compared to the egg-derived vaccines that currently dominate the market, but their widespread use is hampered by a lack of high yield, low cost production platforms. Identification and knockout of innate immune and metabolic restriction factors within relevant host cell lines used to grow the virus could offer a means to substantially increase vaccine yield. In this paper, we describe and validate a novel genome-wide pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy that incorporates a reporter virus and a FACS selection step to identify and rank restriction factors in a given vaccine production cell line. Using the HEK-293SF cell line and A/PuertoRico/8/1934 H1N1 influenza as a model, we identify 64 putative influenza restriction factors to direct the creation of high yield knockout cell lines. In addition, gene ontology and protein complex enrichment analysis of this list of putative restriction factors offers broader insights into the primary host cell determinants of viral yield in cell-based vaccine production systems. Overall, this work will advance efforts to address the public health burden posed by influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on identifying host restriction factors affecting influenza virus yield in cell-based vaccine production, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolution and Antigenic Drift of Influenza A (H7N9) Viruses, China, 2017-2019.
Abstract: After a sharp decrease of influenza A(H7N9) virus in China in 2018, highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses re-emerged in 2019. These H7N9 variants exhibited a new predominant subclade and had been cocirculating at a low level in eastern and northeastern China. Several immune escape mutations and antigenic drift were observed in H7N9 variants.
Relevant: False
Reason: The abstract mentions evolution and antigenic drift of H7N9 viruses but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Controlling Avian Influenza Virus in Bangladesh: Challenges and Recommendations.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) remains a huge challenge for poultry production with negative repercussions for micro- and macro-economy and public health in Bangladesh. High (HP) H5N1 and low pathogenicity (LP) H9N2 AIV are currently endemic in poultry, and both have been reported to infect humans sporadically. Multiple virus introductions of different clades of HPAIV H5N1, reassorted genotypes, and on-going diversification of LPAIV H9N2 create a highly volatile virological environment which potentially implicates increased virulence, adaptation to new host species, and subsequent zoonotic transmission. Allotropy of poultry rearing systems and supply chains further increase the risk of virus spreading, which leads to human exposure and fosters the emergence of new potentially pre-pandemic virus strains. Here, we review the epidemiology, focusing on (i) risk factors for virus spreading, (ii) viral genetic evolution, and (iii) options for AIV control in Bangladesh. It is concluded that improved control strategies would profit from the integration of various intervention tools, including effective vaccination, enhanced biosecurity practice, and improved awareness of producers and traders, although widespread household poultry rearing significantly interferes with any such strategies. Nevertheless, continuous surveillance associated with rapid diagnosis and thorough virus characterization is the basis of such strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, and control strategies without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Histone Deacetylase 6 Knockout Mice Exhibit Higher Susceptibility to Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: The host innate defence against influenza virus infection is an intricate system with a plethora of antiviral factors involved. We have identified host histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as an anti-influenza virus factor in cultured cells. Consistent with this, we report herein that HDAC6 knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to influenza virus A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) infection than their wild type (WT) counterparts. The KO mice lost weight faster than the WT mice and, unlike WT mice, could not recover their original body weight. Consequently, more KO mice succumbed to infection, which corresponded with higher lung viral loads. Conversely, the expression of the critical innate antiviral response genes interferon alpha/beta, CD80, CXCL10 and IL15 was significantly downregulated in KO mouse lungs compared to WT mouse lungs. These data are consistent with the known function of HDAC6 of de-acetylating the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and activating the host innate antiviral response cascade. Loss of HDAC6 thus leads to a blunted innate response and increased susceptibility of mice to influenza A virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host factor HDAC6 knockout effects on susceptibility to influenza infection, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Oral Supplementation of the Vitamin D Metabolite 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> Against Influenza Virus Infection in Mice.
Abstract: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is metabolized by the liver into 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and then by the kidney into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D], which activates the vitamin D receptor expressed in various cells, including immune cells, for an overall immunostimulatory effect. Here, to investigate whether oral supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> [25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>], a major form of vitamin D metabolite 25(OH)D, has a prophylactic effect on influenza A virus infection, mice were fed a diet containing a high dose of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and were challenged with the influenza virus. In the lungs of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>-fed mice, the viral titers were significantly lower than in the lungs of standardly fed mice. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IFN-γ were significantly downregulated after viral infection in 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>-fed mice, while anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly upregulated. These results indicate that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines and reduces virus replication and clinical manifestations of influenza virus infection in a mouse model.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the effect of vitamin D supplementation on influenza infection in mice, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Pyruvate affects inflammatory responses of macrophages during influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and transported into the mitochondria for use in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is also a common additive in cell culture media. We discovered that inclusion of sodium pyruvate in culture media during infection of mouse bone marrow derived macrophages with influenza A virus impaired cytokine production (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α). Sodium pyruvate did not inhibit viral RNA replication. Instead, the addition of sodium pyruvate alters cellular metabolism and diminished mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lowered immune signaling. Overall, sodium pyruvate affects the immune response produced by macrophages but does not inhibit virus replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of pyruvate on macrophage inflammatory responses during influenza A infection but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A systems biology-driven approach to construct a comprehensive protein interaction network of influenza A virus with its host.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a serious public health problem not only in South East Asia but also in European and African countries. Scientists are using network biology to dig deep into the essential host factors responsible for regulation of virus infections. Researchers can explore the virus invasion into the host cells by studying the virus-host relationship based on their protein-protein interaction network. In this study, we present a comprehensive IAV-host protein-protein interaction network that is obtained based on the literature-curated protein interaction datasets and some important interaction databases. The network is constructed in Cytoscape and analyzed with its plugins including CytoHubba, CytoCluster, MCODE, ClusterViz and ClusterOne. In addition, Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses are performed on the highly IAV-associated human proteins. We also compare the current results with those from our previous study on Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-host protein-protein interaction network in order to find out valuable information. We found out 1027 interactions among 829 proteins of which 14 are viral proteins and 815 belong to human proteins. The viral protein NS1 has the highest number of associations with human proteins followed by NP, PB2 and so on. Among human proteins, LNX2, MEOX2, TFCP2, PRKRA and DVL2 have the most interactions with viral proteins. Based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the highly IAV-associated human proteins, we found out that they are enriched in the KEGG pathway of basal cell carcinoma. Similarly, the result of KEGG analysis of the common host factors involved in IAV and HCV infections shows that these factors are enriched in the infection pathways of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Viral Carcinoma, measles and certain other viruses. It is concluded that the list of proteins we identified might be used as potential drug targets for the drug design against the infectious diseases caused by Influenza A Virus and other viruses.

Title: Predominance of influenza virus A(H3N2) 3C.2a1b and A(H1N1)pdm09 6B.1A5A genetic subclades in the WHO European Region, 2018-2019.
Abstract: The 2018/2019 influenza season in the WHO European Region was dominated by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and (H3N2) viruses, with very few influenza B viruses detected. Countries in the European Region reported virus characterization data to The European Surveillance System for weeks 40/2018 to 20/2019. These virus antigenic and genetic characterization and haemagglutinin (HA) sequence data were analysed to describe and assess circulating viruses relative to the 2018/2019 vaccine virus components for the northern hemisphere. Thirty countries reported 4776 viruses characterized genetically and 3311 viruses antigenically. All genetically characterized A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses fell in subclade 6B.1A, of which 90% carried the amino acid substitution S183P in the HA gene. Antigenic data indicated that circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were similar to the 2018/2019 vaccine virus. Genetic data showed that A(H3N2) viruses mostly fell in clade 3C.2a (75%) and 90% of which were subclade 3C.2a1b. A lower proportion fell in clade 3C.3a (23%) and were antigenically distinct from the vaccine virus. All B/Victoria viruses belonged to clade 1A; 30% carried a double amino acid deletion in HA and were genetically and antigenically similar to the vaccine virus component, while 55% carried a triple amino acid deletion or no deletion in HA; these were antigenically distinct from each other and from the vaccine component. All B/Yamagata viruses belonged to clade 3 and were antigenically similar to the virus component in the quadrivalent vaccine for 2018/2019. A simultaneous circulation of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) and B/Victoria viruses was observed and represented a challenge to vaccine strain selection.

Title: Virtual Screening Identifies Chebulagic Acid as an Inhibitor of the M2(S31N) Viral Ion Channel and Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant influenza viruses emphasizes the need for new antiviral countermeasures. The M2 protein of influenza A is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel, which is essential for influenza replication and an established antiviral target. However, all currently circulating influenza A virus strains are now resistant to licensed M2-targeting adamantane drugs, primarily due to the widespread prevalence of an M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N). To identify new chemical leads that may target M2(S31N), we performed a virtual screen of molecules from two natural product libraries and identified chebulagic acid as a candidate M2(S31N) inhibitor and influenza antiviral. Chebulagic acid selectively restores growth of M2(S31N)-expressing yeast. Molecular modeling also suggests that chebulagic acid hydrolysis fragments preferentially interact with the highly-conserved histidine residue within the pore of M2(S31N) but not adamantane-sensitive M2(S31). In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibits in vitro influenza A replication regardless of M2 sequence, suggesting that it also acts on other influenza targets. Taken together, results implicate chebulagic acid and/or its hydrolysis fragments as new chemical leads for M2(S31N) and influenza-directed antiviral development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies chebulagic acid as an inhibitor of influenza A virus M2 ion channel but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: AGL2017-82570-RReverse genetics approaches for the development of new vaccines against influenza A virus infections.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) represent a serious concern globally because they are capable of rapid spread and cause severe disease in humans and other animals. The development and implementation of plasmid-based reverse genetics approaches have allowed the manipulation and recovery of recombinant IAVs from complementary DNA copies of the viral genome. Furthermore, IAV reverse genetics have provided researchers an efficient and powerful platform to introduce specific changes in the viral genome with the final goal of studying IAV biology, designing more effective vaccine strategies, and to reduce the rates of incidence and mortality associated with viral infections. In this review, we briefly discuss IAV reverse genetics and their applications to prevent IAV infections.

Title: Interferon-Dependent and Respiratory Virus-Specific Interference in Dual Infections of Airway Epithelia.
Abstract: Many respiratory viruses cocirculate in the population and multiple infections are commonly reported. The clinical impact of coinfection is unclear and may vary depending on the viral couples involved. Using three-dimensional reconstituted human airway epithelia and clinical viral strains, we investigated the interaction between influenza virus (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV). We showed that Flu and RSV interfere with RV replication, whereas RV does not interfere with either of these viruses. We then experimentally demonstrated that, when present, the interference is not related to a block of viral entry but rather to type I and type III interferon (IFN), the front-line antiviral defense of the respiratory mucosa. Consistent with this observation, we highlighted the differential sensitivity of each virus to IFNs, with RV being the only virus significantly inhibited by IFN-λ and the most sensitive to IFN-α. Finally, as type III IFN is of therapeutic interest due to its low proinflammatory profile, we also assessed and confirmed an inhibitory effect of IFN-λ in the context of persistent RV infections. The present work provides mechanistic clues concerning innate immunity involvement during respiratory virus interactions and confirms that IFN-λ is a promising candidate in the treatment of RV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates interferon-dependent viral interference in co-infections but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Roles of lncRNAs in influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Recent studies have identified host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key regulators of host-virus interactions during viral infection. The influenza A virus (IAV) remains a serious threat to public health and economic stability. It is well known that thousands of lncRNAs are differentially expressed upon IAV infection, some of which regulate IAV infection by modulating the host innate immune response, affecting cellular metabolism, or directly interacting with viral proteins. Some of these lncRNAs appear to be required for IAV infection, but the molecular mechanisms are not completely elucidated. In this review, we summarize the roles of host lncRNAs in regulating IAV infection and provide an overview of the lncRNA-mediated regulatory network. The goal of this review is to stimulate further research on the function of both well-established and newly discovered lncRNAs in IAV infection.

Title: Regional Transmission and Reassortment of 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Viruses in Bulgarian Poultry 2017/18.
Abstract: Between 2017 and 2018, several farms across Bulgaria reported outbreaks of H5 highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. In this study we used genomic and traditional epidemiological analyses to trace the origin and subsequent spread of these outbreaks within Bulgaria. Both methods indicate two separate incursions, one restricted to the northeastern region of Dobrich, and another largely restricted to Central and Eastern Bulgaria including places such as Plovdiv, Sliven and Stara Zagora, as well as one virus from the Western region of Vidin. Both outbreaks likely originate from different European 2.3.4.4b virus ancestors circulating in 2017. The viruses were likely introduced by wild birds or poultry trade links in 2017 and have continued to circulate, but due to lack of contemporaneous sampling and sequences from wild bird viruses in Bulgaria, the precise route and timing of introduction cannot be determined. Analysis of whole genomes indicates a complete lack of reassortment in all segments but the matrix protein gene (MP), which presents as multiple smaller clusters associated with different European 2.3.4.4b viruses. Ancestral reconstruction of host states of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of viruses involved in the outbreaks suggests that transmission is driven by domestic ducks into galliform poultry. Thus, according to present evidence, we suggest the surveillance of domestic ducks as they are an epidemiologically relevant species for subclinical infection. Monitoring the spread due to movement between farms within regions and links to poultry production systems in European countries can help to predict and prevent future outbreaks. The 2.3.4.4b lineage which caused the largest recorded poultry epidemic in Europe continues to circulate, and the risk of further transmission by wild birds during migration remains.

Reason: The study focuses on regional transmission and reassortment of HPAI viruses using genomic and epidemiological analyses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic characterization of the first detected human case of low pathogenic avian influenza A/H9N2 in sub-Saharan Africa, Senegal.
Abstract: The H9N2 influenza virus has become one of the dominant subtypes of influenza virus circulating in poultry, wild birds, and can occasionally cross the mammalian species barrier. Here, we report the first human A/H9N2 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The patient was a child of 16 months' old living in the South-West of Senegal. He had no influenza vaccination history and no other disease history. He had symptoms of fever with an auxiliary temperature of 39.1°C. Respiratory symptoms were an intense cough, runny nose and pulmonary crackles. All eight genome segments belonged to the A/H9N2 AIV subtype and the strain characyerized as of low pathogenicity with a RSSR/GLF amino acids mo-tif. Phylogenetic analysis of both complete HA and NA gene segments showed that the A/H9N2 subtype virus from Senegal belonged to the G1 lineage. This human case highlights the weakness of influenza surveillance in animals and the need for enhanced surveillance using a one-health approach.
Relevant: False

Title: Isolation of two novel reassortant H3N6 avian influenza viruses from long-distance migratory birds in Jiangxi Province, China.
Abstract: Two novel reassortant avian influenza A (H3N6) viruses were isolated from swan goose in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China, in 2014. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these viruses are most likely derived from the Eurasian-originated H3Ny (N3, N6, N8) and H5N6 viruses circulating among wild and domestic birds. It is noteworthy that H9N2 viruses have contributed PB1 gene to these novel H3N6 viruses. Our findings provide phylogenetic evidence to elucidate the ongoing viral reassortment in the wild bird population in southern China. Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Poyang Lake is warranted.

Title: Ethanol Extract of <i>Caesalpinia decapetala</i> Inhibits Influenza Virus Infection In Vitro and In Vivo.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections can lead to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases, causing significant morbidity and mortality and posing a great threat to human health. Because of the diversity of influenza virus strains and drug resistance to the current direct antiviral agents, there have been no effective drugs as yet to cure all patients infected by influenza viruses. Natural products from plants contain compounds with diverse structures that have the potential to interact with multiple host and virus factors. In this study, we identified the ethanol extract of <i>Caesalpinia decapetala</i> (Roth) Alston (EEC) as an inhibitor against the replication of a panel of influenza A and B viruses both on human pulmonary epithelial A549 and human monocytic U937 cells. The animal study revealed that EEC administration reduces the weight loss and improves the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus. Also, EEC treatment attenuated lung injury and reduced virus titer significantly. In conclusion, we showed that EEC has antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the plant <i>C. decapetala</i> has the potential to be further developed as a resource of new anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Genetic and antigenic characterization of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory waterfowl in Mongolia from 2017 to 2019.
Abstract: The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of various subtypes (e.g., H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9) in poultry remains a global concern for animal and public health. Migratory waterfowls play important roles in the transmission of these viruses across countries. To monitor virus spread by wild birds, active surveillance for avian influenza in migratory waterfowl was conducted in Mongolia from 2015 to 2019. In total, 5000 fecal samples were collected from lakesides in central Mongolia, and 167 influenza A viruses were isolated. Two H5N3, four H7N3, and two H7N7 viruses were characterized in this study. The amino acid sequence at hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of those isolates suggested low pathogenicity in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all H5 and H7 viruses were closely related to recent H5 and H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) isolated from wild birds in Asia and Europe. Antigenicity of H7Nx was similar to those of typical non-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs). While HPAIVs or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)-related LPAIVs were not detected in migratory waterfowl in Mongolia, sporadic introductions of AIVs including H5 and H7 viruses into Mongolia through the wild bird migration were identified. Thus, continued monitoring of H5 and H7 AIVs in both domestic and wild birds is needed for the early detection of HPAIVs spread into the country.

Title: Topology-Matching Design of an Influenza-Neutralizing Spiky Nanoparticle-Based Inhibitor with a Dual Mode of Action.
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the concept of "topology-matching design" for virus inhibitors. With the current knowledge of influenza A virus (IAV), we designed a nanoparticle-based inhibitor (nano-inhibitor) that has a matched nanotopology to IAV virions and shows heteromultivalent inhibitory effects on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The synthesized nano-inhibitor can neutralize the viral particle extracellularly and block its attachment and entry to the host cells. The virus replication was significantly reduced by 6 orders of magnitude in the presence of the reverse designed nano-inhibitors. Even when used 24 hours after the infection, more than 99.999 % inhibition is still achieved, which indicates such a nano-inhibitor might be a potent antiviral for the treatment of influenza infection.

Title: The influenza replication blocking inhibitor LASAG does not sensitize human epithelial cells for bacterial infections.
Abstract: Severe influenza virus (IV) infections still represent a major challenge to public health. To combat IV infections, vaccines and antiviral compounds are available. However, vaccine efficacies vary with very limited to no protection against newly emerging zoonotic IV introductions. In addition, the development of resistant virus variants against currently available antivirals can be rapidly detected, in consequence demanding the design of novel antiviral strategies. Virus supportive cellular signaling cascades, such as the NF-κB pathway, have been identified to be promising antiviral targets against IV in in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials. While administration of NF-κB pathway inhibiting agents, such as LASAG results in decreased IV replication, it remained unclear whether blocking of NF-κB might sensitize cells to secondary bacterial infections, which often come along with viral infections. Thus, we examined IV and Staphylococcus aureus growth during LASAG treatment. Interestingly, our data reveal that the presence of LASAG during superinfection still leads to reduced IV titers. Furthermore, the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway resulted in decreased intracellular Staphylococcus aureus loads within epithelial cells, indicating a dependency on the pathway for bacterial uptake. Unfortunately, so far it is not entirely clear if this phenomenon might be a drawback in bacterial clearance during infection.

Title: Phylogeography of Highly Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza Viruses in China.
Abstract: The spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses poses serious threats to the poultry industry, wild bird ecology and human health. Circulation of H5 viruses between poultry and wild birds is a significant public health threat in China. Thus, viral migration networks in this region need to be urgently studied. Here, we conducted molecular genetic analyses of the hemagglutinin genes of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in multiple hosts from 2000 to 2018 in China. Our aim was to clarify the roles of different hosts in the evolution of H5 viruses. We used a flexible Bayesian statistical framework to simulate viral space diffusion and continuous-time Markov chains to infer the dynamic evolutionary process of spatiotemporal dissemination. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of H5 viruses showed for the first time that H5 viruses in poultry and wild birds were present in Guangdong Province. Furthermore, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Hunan acted as the epicenters for the spread of various H5 subtypes viruses in poultry, and Henan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Inner Mongolia acted as epicenters for the spread of various H5 subtypes viruses in wild birds. Thus, H5 viruses exhibited distinct evolutionary dynamics in poultry and wild birds. Our findings extend our understanding of the transmission and spread of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses in China.

Title: A human cell polarity protein Lgl2 regulates influenza A virus nucleoprotein exportation from nucleus in MDCK cells.
Abstract: In this study, the regulatory effect of the overexpression of polarity protein Lgl2 on the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein in infected cells was investigated. A stable Tet-Off inducible MDCK cell line expressing a fusion protein comprising Lgl2 and an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein were used. TCID50 analysis and neuraminidase activity analysis revealed that replication of influenza A virus was inhibited in Lgl2 overexpressing cells. By immunofluorescence microscopical observation at different time point post virus infection, a retention of NP in cellular nucleus was found in Lgl2 overexpressing cells. Compared with normal MDCK cells, change in claudin-1 distribution between cell contacts caused by Lgl2 overexpression impaired the barrier function of tight junction. These results suggest that changes in cell polarity induced by Lgl2 overexpressing will affect virus NP transportation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the effect of a host cell polarity protein on influenza A virus nucleoprotein export and replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral Activities of Compounds Isolated from <i>Pinus densiflora</i> (Pine Tree) against the Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: <i>Pinus densiflora</i> was screened in an ongoing project to discover anti-influenza candidates from natural products. An extensive phytochemical investigation provided 26 compounds, including two new megastigmane glycosides (<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>), 21 diterpenoids (<b>3-23</b>), and three flavonoids (<b>24-26</b>). The chemical structures were elucidated by a series of chemical reactions, including modified Mosher's analysis and various spectroscopic measurements such as LC/MS and 1D- and 2D-NMR. The anti-influenza A activities of all isolates were screened by cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays. Ten candidates were selected, and detailed mechanistic studies were performed by various assays, such as Western blot, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Compound <b>5</b> exerted its antiviral activity not by direct neutralizing virion surface proteins, such as HA, but by inhibiting the expression of viral mRNA. In contrast, compound <b>24</b> showed NA inhibitory activity in a noncompetitive manner with little effect on viral mRNA expression. Interestingly, both compounds <b>5</b> and <b>24</b> were shown to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results provide not only the chemical profiling of <i>P. densiflora</i> but also anti-influenza A candidates.

Title: Host Protective Immune Responses against Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause infectious respiratory disease characterized by fever, myalgia, and congestion, ranging in severity from mild to life-threating. Although enormous efforts have aimed to prevent and treat influenza infections, seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks remain a major public health concern. This is largely because influenza viruses rapidly undergo genetic mutations that restrict the long-lasting efficacy of vaccine-induced immune responses and therapeutic regimens. In this review, we discuss the virological features of influenza A viruses and provide an overview of current knowledge of the innate sensing of invading influenza viruses and the protective immune responses in the host.

Title: A method for the unbiased quantification of reassortment in segmented viruses.
Abstract: Reassortment of segmented viruses can be an important source of genetic diversity underlying viral evolution and emergence. Methods for the quantification of reassortment have been described but are often cumbersome and best suited for the analysis of reassortment between highly divergent parental strains. While it is useful to understand the potential of divergent parents to reassort, outcomes of such heterologous reassortment are driven by differential selection acting on the progeny and are typically strain specific. To quantify reassortment robustly, a system free of differential selection is needed. We have generated such a system for influenza A virus and for mammalian orthoreovirus by constructing well-matched parental viruses carrying small genetic tags. The method utilizes high-resolution melt technology for the identification of reassortant viruses. Ease of sample preparation and data analysis enables streamlined genotyping of a large number of virus clones. The method described here thereby allows quantification of the efficiency of reassortment and can be applied to diverse segmented viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a method to quantify reassortment in segmented viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Development of CRISPR as an Antiviral Strategy to Combat SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza.
Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the need for antiviral approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.

Reason: The study develops a CRISPR-based antiviral strategy targeting conserved viral regions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Massively multiplexed nucleic acid detection with Cas13.
Abstract: The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples<sup>1-3</sup> while simultaneously testing for many pathogens<sup>4-6</sup>. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents<sup>7</sup> self-organize in a microwell array<sup>8</sup> to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health<sup>9-11</sup>.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a multiplexed nucleic acid detection platform without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Seasonal and pandemic influenza: 100 years of progress, still much to learn.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are highly transmissible, both within and between host species. The severity of the disease they cause is highly variable, from the mild and inapparent through to the devastating and fatal. The unpredictability of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks is accompanied but the predictability of seasonal disease in wide areas of the Globe, providing an inexorable toll on human health and survival. Although there have been great improvements in understanding influenza viruses and the disease that they cause, our knowledge of the effects they have on the host and the ways that the host immune system responds continues to develop. This review highlights the importance of the mucosa in defence against infection and in understanding the pathogenesis of disease. Although vaccines have been available for many decades, they remain suboptimal in needing constant redesign and in only providing short-term protection. There are real prospects for improvement in treatment and prevention of influenza soon, based on deeper knowledge of how the virus transmits, replicates and triggers immune defences at the mucosal surface.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on influenza viruses and host immune responses without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: A Structure-Based Model for the Complete Transcription Cycle of Influenza Polymerase.
Abstract: Influenza polymerase uses unique mechanisms to synthesize capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) template, which is packaged inside ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs). Here, we visualize by cryoelectron microscopy the conformational dynamics of the polymerase during the complete transcription cycle from pre-initiation to termination, focusing on the template trajectory. After exiting the active site cavity, the template 3' extremity rebinds into a specific site on the polymerase surface. Here, it remains sequestered during all subsequent transcription steps, forcing the template to loop out as it further translocates. At termination, the strained connection between the bound template 5' end and the active site results in polyadenylation by stuttering at uridine 17. Upon product dissociation, further conformational changes release the trapped template, allowing recycling back into the pre-initiation state. Influenza polymerase thus performs transcription while tightly binding to and protecting both template ends, allowing efficient production of multiple mRNAs from a single vRNP.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on structural and mechanistic insights into influenza polymerase transcription cycle without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Inferring Transmission Bottleneck Size from Viral Sequence Data Using a Novel Haplotype Reconstruction Method.
Abstract: The transmission bottleneck is defined as the number of viral particles that transmit from one host to establish an infection in another. Genome sequence data have been used to evaluate the size of the transmission bottleneck between humans infected with the influenza virus; however, the methods used to make these estimates have some limitations. Specifically, viral allele frequencies, which form the basis of many calculations, may not fully capture a process which involves the transmission of entire viral genomes. Here, we set out a novel approach for inferring viral transmission bottlenecks; our method combines an algorithm for haplotype reconstruction with maximum likelihood methods for bottleneck inference. This approach allows for rapid calculation and performs well when applied to data from simulated transmission events; errors in the haplotype reconstruction step did not adversely affect inferences of the population bottleneck. Applied to data from a previous household transmission study of influenza A infection, we confirm the result that the majority of transmission events involve a small number of viruses, albeit with slightly looser bottlenecks being inferred, with between 1 and 13 particles transmitted in the majority of cases. While influenza A transmission involves a tight population bottleneck, the bottleneck is not so tight as to universally prevent the transmission of within-host viral diversity.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viral populations undergo a repeated cycle of within-host growth followed by transmission. Viral evolution is affected by each stage of this cycle. The number of viral particles transmitted from one host to another, known as the transmission bottleneck, is an important factor in determining how the evolutionary dynamics of the population play out, restricting the extent to which the evolved diversity of the population can be passed from one host to another. Previous study of viral sequence data has suggested that the transmission bottleneck size for influenza A transmission between human hosts is small. Reevaluating these data using a novel and improved method, we largely confirm this result, albeit that we infer a slightly higher bottleneck size in some cases, of between 1 and 13 virions. While a tight bottleneck operates in human influenza transmission, it is not extreme in nature; some diversity can be meaningfully retained between hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops a method to infer transmission bottleneck size from viral sequence data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Baloxavir treatment of ferrets infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reduces onward transmission.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause seasonal outbreaks and pose a continuous pandemic threat. Although vaccines are available for influenza control, their efficacy varies each season and a vaccine for a novel pandemic virus manufactured using current technology will not be available fast enough to mitigate the effect of the first pandemic wave. Antivirals can be effective against many different influenza viruses but have not thus far been used extensively for outbreak control. Baloxavir, a recently licensed antiviral drug that targets the influenza virus endonuclease, has been shown to reduce virus shedding more effectively than oseltamivir, a widely used neuraminidase inhibitor drug. Thus it is possible that treatment with baloxavir might also interrupt onward virus transmission. To test this, we utilized the ferret model, which is the most commonly used animal model to study influenza virus transmission. We established a subcutaneous baloxavir administration method in ferrets which achieved similar pharmacokinetics to the approved human oral dose. Transmission studies were then conducted in two different locations with different experimental setups to compare the onward transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from infected ferrets treated with baloxavir, oseltamivir or placebo to naïve sentinel ferrets exposed either indirectly in adjacent cages or directly by co-housing. We found that baloxavir treatment reduced infectious viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets compared to placebo, and reduced the frequency of transmission amongst sentinels in both experimental setups, even when treatment was delayed until 2 days post-infection. In contrast, oseltamivir treatment did not substantially affect viral shedding or transmission compared to placebo. We did not detect the emergence of baloxavir-resistant variants in treated animals or in untreated sentinels. Our results support the concept that antivirals which decrease viral shedding could also reduce influenza transmission in the community.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral treatment effects on viral shedding and transmission in ferrets but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Performance of an acoustic settler versus a hollow fiber-based ATF technology for influenza virus production in perfusion.
Abstract: Process intensification and integration is crucial regarding an ever increasing pressure on manufacturing costs and capacities in biologics manufacturing. For virus production in perfusion mode, membrane-based alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) and acoustic settler are the commonly described cell retention technologies. While acoustic settlers allow for continuous influenza virus harvesting, the use of commercially available membranes for ATF systems typically results in the accumulation of virus particles in the bioreactor vessel. Accordingly, with one single harvest at the end of a cultivation, this increases the risk of lowering the product quality. To assess which cell retention device would be most suitable for influenza A virus production, we compared various key performance figures using AGE1.CR.pIX cells at concentrations between 25 and 50 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL at similar infection conditions using either an ATF system or an acoustic settler. Production yields, process-related impurities, and aggregation of viruses and other large molecules were evaluated. Taking into account the total number of virions from both the bioreactor and the harvest vessel, a 1.5-3.0-fold higher volumetric virus yield was obtained for the acoustic settler. In addition, fewer large-sized aggregates (virus particles and other molecules) were observed in the harvest taken directly from the bioreactor. In contrast, similar levels of process-related impurities (host cell dsDNA, total protein) were obtained in the harvest for both retention systems. Overall, a clear advantage was observed for continuous virus harvesting after the acoustic settler operation mode was optimized. This development may also allow direct integration of subsequent downstream processing steps. KEY POINTS: • High suspension cell density, immortalized avian cell line, influenza vaccine.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares cell retention technologies for influenza virus production without addressing viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A mathematical model describing the localization and spread of influenza A virus infection within the human respiratory tract.
Abstract: Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell's beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 μm/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.

Title: Chemical intervention of influenza virus mRNA nuclear export.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are human pathogens with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is crucial to devise strategies for the identification of new classes of antiviral medications. The influenza A virus genome is constituted of 8 RNA segments. Two of these viral RNAs are transcribed into mRNAs that are alternatively spliced. The M1 mRNA encodes the M1 protein but is also alternatively spliced to yield the M2 mRNA during infection. M1 to M2 mRNA splicing occurs at nuclear speckles, and M1 and M2 mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. M1 and M2 proteins are critical for viral trafficking, assembly, and budding. Here we show that gene knockout of the cellular protein NS1-BP, a constituent of the M mRNA speckle-export pathway and a binding partner of the virulence factor NS1 protein, inhibits M mRNA nuclear export without altering bulk cellular mRNA export, providing an avenue to preferentially target influenza virus. We performed a high-content, image-based chemical screen using single-molecule RNA-FISH to label viral M mRNAs followed by multistep quantitative approaches to assess cellular mRNA and cell toxicity. We identified inhibitors of viral mRNA biogenesis and nuclear export that exhibited no significant activity towards bulk cellular mRNA at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Among the hits is a small molecule that preferentially inhibits nuclear export of a subset of viral and cellular mRNAs without altering bulk cellular mRNA export. These findings underscore specific nuclear export requirements for viral mRNAs and phenocopy down-regulation of the mRNA export factor UAP56. This RNA export inhibitor impaired replication of diverse influenza A virus strains at non-toxic concentrations. Thus, this screening strategy yielded compounds that alone or in combination may serve as leads to new ways of treating influenza virus infection and are novel tools for studying viral RNA trafficking in the nucleus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies chemical inhibitors of viral mRNA export but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Host-Virus Interaction: How Host Cells Defend against Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are highly contagious pathogens infecting human and numerous animals. The viruses cause millions of infection cases and thousands of deaths every year, thus making IAVs a continual threat to global health. Upon IAV infection, host innate immune system is triggered and activated to restrict virus replication and clear pathogens. Subsequently, host adaptive immunity is involved in specific virus clearance. On the other hand, to achieve a successful infection, IAVs also apply multiple strategies to avoid be detected and eliminated by the host immunity. In the current review, we present a general description on recent work regarding different host cells and molecules facilitating antiviral defenses against IAV infection and how IAVs antagonize host immune responses.

Title: Put a cork in it: Plugging the M2 viral ion channel to sink influenza.
Abstract: The ongoing threat of seasonal and pandemic influenza to human health requires antivirals that can effectively supplement existing vaccination strategies. The M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel that is required for virus replication and is an established antiviral target. While licensed adamantane-based M2 antivirals have been historically used, M2 mutations that confer major adamantane resistance are now so prevalent in circulating virus strains that these drugs are no longer recommended. Here we review the current understanding of IAV M2 structure and function, mechanisms of inhibition, the rise of drug resistance mutations, and ongoing efforts to develop new antivirals that target resistant forms of M2.

Title: Influence of cellular lipid content on influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) depends on the metabolism of its cellular host to provide energy and essential factors, including lipids, for viral replication. Previous studies have shown that fatty acids (FAs) play an important role in IAV replication and that inhibition of FA biosynthesis can diminish viral replication. However, cellular lipids can either be synthesized intracellularly or be imported from the extracellular environment. Interfering with FA import mechanisms may reduce the cellular lipid content and inhibit IAV replication. To test this hypothesis, MDCK and Detroit 562 cells were infected with IAV followed by exposure to palmitic acid and inhibitors of FA import. Replication of IAV significantly increased when infected cells were supplied with palmitic acid. This enhancement could be reduced by adding an FA import inhibitor. The addition of palmitic acid significantly increased the cellular lipid content, and this increased level was reduced by treatment with an FA import inhibitor. These results show that reducing the cellular lipid level might be an approach for IAV therapy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the influence of cellular lipid content on viral replication, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Identification of entry inhibitors with 4-aminopiperidine scaffold targeting group 1 influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal flu and occasionally pandemics. The current therapeutics against IAVs target two viral proteins - neuraminidase (NA) and M2 ion-channel protein. However, M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) are no longer recommended by CDC for use due to the emergence of high level of antiviral resistance among the circulating influenza viruses, and resistant strains to NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) have also been reported. Therefore, development of novel anti-influenza therapies is urgently needed. As one of the viral surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) mediates critical virus entry steps including virus binding to host cells and virus-host membrane fusion, which makes it a potential target for anti-influenza drug development. In this study, we report the identification of compound CBS1116 with a 4-aminopiperidine scaffold from a chemical library screen as an entry inhibitor specifically targeting two group 1 influenza A viruses, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and recombinant low pathogenic avian H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/1203/04, VN04<sub>Low</sub>). Mechanism of action studies show that CBS1116 interferes with the HA-mediated fusion process. Further structure activity relationship study generated a more potent compound CBS1117 which has a 50% inhibitory concentration of 70 nM and a selectivity index of ~4000 against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) infection in human lung epithelial cell line (A549).

Title: Porous gold nanoparticles for attenuating infectivity of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza viruses (IVs) have become increasingly resistant to antiviral drugs that target neuraminidase and matrix protein 2 due to gene mutations that alter their drug-binding target protein regions. Consequently, almost all recent IV pandemics have exhibited resistance to commercial antiviral vaccines. To overcome this challenge, an antiviral target is needed that is effective regardless of genetic mutations. In particular, hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein across many IV strains, could be an effective antiviral target as it mediates binding of IVs with host cell receptors, which is crucial for membrane fusion. HA has 6 disulfide bonds that can easily bind with the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. Herein, we fabricated porous gold nanoparticles (PoGNPs) via a surfactant-free emulsion method that exhibited strong affinity for disulfide bonds due to gold-thiol interactions, and provided extensive surface area for these interactions. A remarkable decrease in viral infectivity was demonstrated by increased cell viability results after exposing MDCK cells to various IV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) treated with PoGNP. Most of all, the viability of MDCK cells infected with all IV strains increased to 96.8% after PoGNP treatment of the viruses compared to 33.9% cell viability with non-treated viruses. Intracellular viral RNA quantification by real-time RT-PCR also confirmed that PoGNP successfully inhibited viral membrane fusion by blocking the viral entry process through conformational deformation of HA. We believe that the technique described herein can be further developed for PoGNP-utilized antiviral protection as well as metal nanoparticle-based therapy to treat viral infection. Additionally, facile detection of IAV can be achieved by developing PoGNP as a multiplatform for detection of the virus.
Relevant: False

Title: Deficiency of HIF-1α enhances influenza A virus replication by promoting autophagy in alveolar type II epithelial cells.
Abstract: Infection of influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and induce acute lung injury (ALI). Limiting IAV replication and alleviation of pulmonary inflammation are two important therapeutic strategies for influenza virus infection. Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an essential factor for the development and repair of ALI; however, the role and the underlying mechanisms of HIF-1α in IAV-induced ALI remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that lung epithelial cell-specific <i>Hif1α</i> knockout mice infected with IAV developed more lung IAV replication and severe lung inflammation, which led to increased mortality compared to IAV-infected control mice. Moreover, knockdown of <i>HIF1A</i> in A549 cells (human alveolar type II epithelial cell line) promoted IAV replication <i>in vitro</i>. Mechanistically, knockdown of <i>HIF1A</i> reduced glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes, which subsequently activated the AMPKα-ULK1 signalling pathway. Interestingly, AMPKα-ULK1 signalling promoted autophagy and augmented IAV replication. Taken together, deficiency of HIF-1α in lung epithelial cells reduces glycolysis and enhances AMPKα-ULK1-mediated autophagy, which finally facilitates IAV replication. These findings have deepened our understanding of the role of HIF-1α in regulating IAV replication and provided us novel therapeutic targets for combating influenza infection.

Reason: The study investigates host factor HIF-1α's role in viral replication and autophagy, not viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Subtype Diversity of Influenza A Virus in North American Waterfowl: a Multidecade Study.
Abstract: The discovery in 1976 of waterfowl as the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) has since spurred decades of waterfowl surveillance efforts by researchers dedicated to understanding the ecology of IAV and its subsequent threat to human and animal health. Here, we employed a multidecade, continental-scale approach of surveillance data to understand trends of seasonal IAV subtype diversity. Between 1976 and 2015, IAVs were detected in 8,427 (10.8%) of 77,969 samples from migratory waterfowl throughout the Central and Mississippi Migratory Flyways in the United States and Canada. A total of 96 hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations were isolated, which included most HA (H1 to H14) and all 9 NA subtypes. We observed an annual trend of high influenza prevalence, involving a few dominant subtypes, on northern breeding grounds during summer with progressively lowered influenza prevalence, comprised of a highly diverse profile of subtypes, as waterfowl migrate toward southern wintering grounds. Isolates recovered during winter had the highest proportion of mixed and rare HA/NA combinations, indicating increased opportunity for reassortment of IAVs. In addition, 70% of H5 and 49% of H7 IAV isolates were recovered from samples collected during fall and spring, respectively; these are subtypes that can have significant implications for public health and agriculture sectors. Annual cyclical dominance of subtypes on northern breeding grounds is revealed through the longitudinal nature of this study. Our novel findings exhibit the unrealized potential for discovery using existing IAV surveillance data.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and are therefore responsible for the dispersal and maintenance of IAVs representing a broad range of antigenic and genetic diversity. The aims of IAV surveillance in waterfowl not only relate to understanding the risk of spillover risk to humans, but also to improving our understanding of basic questions related to IAV evolution and ecology. By evaluating several decades of surveillance data from wild aquatic birds sampled along North American migratory flyways, we discovered an annual trend of increasing subtype diversity during southbound migration, peaking on southern wintering grounds. Winter sampling revealed the highest proportion of mixed and rare infections that suggest higher opportunity for spillover. These findings allow improvements to surveillance efforts to robustly capture IAV diversity that will be used for vaccine development and cultivate a more thorough understanding of IAV evolution and persistence mechanisms.

Title: Duck TRIM32 Functions in IFN-β Signaling Against the Infection of H5N6 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus.
Abstract: In mammals, tripartite motif 32 (TRIM32) is essential for regulating host innate immune responses to viral infections. However, the antiviral effect of TRIM32 in birds has not been reported. Here, we cloned the full-length duck TRIM32 (duTRIM32) cDNA from total spleen RNA of Peking duck. DuTRIM32 consists of 682 amino acids and has 95.5% similarity in amino acid sequences with chicken TRIM32 and 84.9% similarity with human TRIM32, respectively. DuTRIM32 mRNA was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues from healthy ducks. Overexpression of duTRIM32 significantly activated the IFN-β promoter and upregulated the mRNA levels of IFN-β, IRF7, and Mx, which indicates that duTRIM32 is involved in the type I IFN pathway. Furthermore, duTRIM32 was found to directly interact with duck STING (duSTING) and to contribute to the expression of IFN-β mediated by duSTING. The mRNA level of duTRIM32 was significantly upregulated in the lungs and spleens of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infected ducks 3 days post-infection (DPI). Furthermore, overexpression of duTRIM32 could inhibit the replication of H5N6 HPAIV in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). Therefore, these results indicate that duTRIM32 is involved in the type I IFN pathway and exhibit an antiviral effect against H5N6 HPAIV infection.

Reason: The paper studies duck TRIM32's antiviral role, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in 2018.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a total of 3993 human influenza-positive samples during 2018. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or hens' eggs for use as potential seasonal influenza vaccine virus candidates. In 2018, influenza A(H1)pdm09 viruses predominated over influenza A(H3) and B viruses, accounting for a total of 53% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO-recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2018. However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that a significant proportion of circulating A(H3) viruses had undergone genetic drift relative to the WHO-recommended vaccine strain for 2018. Of 2864 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, three A(H1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, while one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition by both oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Title: Comprehensive Characterization of Transcriptional Activity during Influenza A Virus Infection Reveals Biases in Cap-Snatching of Host RNA Sequences.
Abstract: Macrophages in the lung detect and respond to influenza A virus (IAV), determining the nature of the immune response. Using terminal-depth cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), we quantified transcriptional activity of both host and pathogen over a 24-h time course of IAV infection in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). This method allowed us to observe heterogenous host sequences incorporated into IAV mRNA, "snatched" 5' RNA caps, and corresponding RNA sequences from host RNAs. In order to determine whether cap-snatching is random or exhibits a bias, we systematically compared host sequences incorporated into viral mRNA ("snatched") against a complete survey of all background host RNA in the same cells, at the same time. Using a computational strategy designed to eliminate sources of bias due to read length, sequencing depth, and multimapping, we were able to quantify overrepresentation of host RNA features among the sequences that were snatched by IAV. We demonstrate biased snatching of numerous host RNAs, particularly small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and avoidance of host transcripts encoding host ribosomal proteins, which are required by IAV for replication. We then used a systems approach to describe the transcriptional landscape of the host response to IAV, observing many new features, including a failure of IAV-treated MDMs to induce feedback inhibitors of inflammation, seen in response to other treatments.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) infection is responsible for an estimated 500,000 deaths and up to 5 million cases of severe respiratory illness each year. In this study, we looked at human primary immune cells (macrophages) infected with IAV. Our method allows us to look at both the host and the virus in parallel. We used these data to explore a process known as "cap-snatching," where IAV snatches a short nucleotide sequence from capped host RNA. This process was believed to be random. We demonstrate biased snatching of numerous host RNAs, including those associated with snRNA transcription, and avoidance of host transcripts encoding host ribosomal proteins, which are required by IAV for replication. We then describe the transcriptional landscape of the host response to IAV, observing new features, including a failure of IAV-treated MDMs to induce feedback inhibitors of inflammation, seen in response to other treatments.

Abstract: A novel H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected in a greater white-fronted goose in January 2020 in Brandenburg, Germany, and, in February 2020, in domestic chickens belonging to a smallholding in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Full-genome sequencing was conducted on the MinION platform, enabling further phylogenetic analyses. The virus of clade 2.3.4.4b holds six segments from a Eurasian/Asian/African HPAIV H5N8 reassortant and two segments from low pathogenic avian influenza H3N8 subtype viruses recently detected in wild birds in Central Russia. These new entries continue to show the reassortment potential of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses, underlining the necessity for full-genome sequencing and continuous surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection and genetic characterization of a novel H5N8 reassortant virus but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Nanopore Sequencing Reveals Novel Targets for Detection and Surveillance of Human and Avian Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Accurate detection of influenza A virus (IAV) is crucial for patient management, infection control, and epidemiological surveillance. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended using the M gene as the diagnostic gene target for reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). However, M gene RT-PCR has reduced sensitivity for recent IAV due to novel gene mutations. Here, we sought to identify novel diagnostic targets for the molecular detection of IAV using long-read third-generation sequencing. Direct nanopore sequencing from 18 nasopharyngeal specimens and one saliva specimen showed that the 5' and 3' ends of the PB2 gene and the entire NS gene were highly abundant. Primers selected for PB2 and NS genes were well matched with seasonal or avian IAV gene sequences. Our novel PB2 and NS gene real-time RT-PCR assays showed limits of detection similar to or lower than that of M gene RT-PCR and achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity in the detection of A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and A(H7N9) in nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. For 10 patients with IAV detected by M gene RT-PCR conversion in sequentially collected specimens, NS and/or PB2 gene RT-PCR was positive in 2 (20%) of the initial specimens that were missed by M gene RT-PCR. In conclusion, we have shown that PB2 or NS gene RT-PCRs are suitable alternatives to the recommended M gene RT-PCR for diagnosis of IAV. Long-read nanopore sequencing facilitates the identification of novel diagnostic targets.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on identifying novel diagnostic gene targets for influenza detection using sequencing, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of two multiplex RT-PCR assays for detection and subtype differentiation of Brazilian swine influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are endemic in swine herds in most pork producing countries; however, the viruses circulating in different geographic regions are antigenically and genetically distinct. In this sense, the availability of a rapid diagnostic assay to detect locally adapted IAVs and discriminate the virus subtype in clinical samples from swine is extremely important for monitoring and control of the disease. This study describes the development and validation of a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and subtyping of IAV from pigs. The analytical and diagnostic specificity of the assays was 100% (94.3-100.0, CI 95%), and the limit of detection was 10<sup>-3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. A total of 100 samples (IAV isolates and clinical specimens) were tested, and the virus subtype was determined for 80 samples (80%; 71.1-86.7, CI 95%). From these, 50% were H1N1, 22.5% were H1N2, and 7.5% were H3N2. Partial subtyping was determined for 8.75% samples (H1pdmNx and HxN2). Additionally, mixed infections with two virus subtypes (H1N2 + H3N2 and H1N1pdm + H1pdmN2; 2.5%) and reassortant viruses (H1pdmN2, 6.25%; and H1N1hu, 2.5%) were detected by the assay. A rapid detection of the most prevalent IAV subtypes and lineages in swine is provided by the assays developed here, improving the IAV diagnosis in Brazilian laboratories, and contributing to the IAV monitoring.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development of multiplex RT-PCR assays for detection and subtyping of swine influenza viruses but does not link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Discovery of Multitarget-Directed Ligands Against Influenza A Virus From Compound Yizhihao Through a Predictive System for Compound-Protein Interactions.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a threat to public health due to its high mutation rate and resistance to existing drugs. In this investigation, 15 targets selected from an influenza virus-host interaction network were successfully constructed as a multitarget virtual screening system for new drug discovery against IAV using Naïve Bayesian, recursive partitioning, and CDOCKER methods. The predictive accuracies of the models were evaluated using training sets and test sets. The system was then used to predict active constituents of Compound Yizhihao (CYZH), a Chinese medicinal compound used to treat influenza. Twenty-eight compounds with multitarget activities were selected for subsequent <i>in vitro</i> evaluation. Of the four compounds predicted to be active on neuraminidase (NA), chlorogenic acid, and orientin showed inhibitory activity <i>in vitro</i>. Linarin, sinensetin, cedar acid, isoliquiritigenin, sinigrin, luteolin, chlorogenic acid, orientin, epigoitrin, and rupestonic acid exhibited significant effects on TNF-α expression, which is almost consistent with predicted results. Results from a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay revealed acacetin, indirubin, tryptanthrin, quercetin, luteolin, emodin, and apigenin had protective effects against wild-type strains of IAV. Quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin had good efficacy against resistant IAV strains in CPE reduction assays. Finally, with the aid of Gene Ontology biological process analysis, the potential mechanisms of CYZH action were revealed. In conclusion, a compound-protein interaction-prediction system was an efficient tool for the discovery of novel compounds against influenza, and the findings from CYZH provide important information for its usage and development.

Reason: The paper focuses on compound-protein interaction prediction and drug discovery against influenza virus, not on linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Microbiota Contributes to the Control of Highly Pathogenic H5N9 Influenza Virus Replication in Ducks.
Abstract: Ducks usually show little or no clinical signs following highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection. In order to analyze whether the microbiota could contribute to the control of influenza virus replication in ducks, we used a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic treatment to deplete the microbiota before infection with a highly pathogenic H5N9 avian influenza virus. Antibiotic-treated ducks and nontreated control ducks did not show any clinical signs following H5N9 virus infection. We did not detect any significant difference in virus titers neither in the respiratory tract nor in the brain nor spleen. However, we found that antibiotic-treated H5N9 virus-infected ducks had significantly increased intestinal virus excretion at days 3 and 5 postinfection. This was associated with a significantly decreased antiviral immune response in the intestine of antibiotic-treated ducks. Our findings highlight the importance of an intact microbiota for an efficient control of avian influenza virus replication in ducks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Ducks are frequently infected with avian influenza viruses belonging to multiple subtypes. They represent an important reservoir species of avian influenza viruses, which can occasionally be transmitted to other bird species or mammals, including humans. Ducks thus have a central role in the epidemiology of influenza virus infection. Importantly, ducks usually show little or no clinical signs even following infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We provide evidence that the microbiota contributes to the control of influenza virus replication in ducks by modulating the antiviral immune response. Ducks are able to control influenza virus replication more efficiently when they have an intact intestinal microbiota. Therefore, maintaining a healthy microbiota by limiting perturbations to its composition should contribute to the prevention of avian influenza virus spread from the duck reservoir.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of microbiota in controlling influenza virus replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Pre-Treatment with Zirconia Nanoparticles Reduces Inflammation Induced by the Pathogenic H5N1 Influenza Virus.
Abstract: New approaches are urgently needed to fight influenza viral infection. Previous research has shown that zirconia nanoparticles can be used as anticancer materials, but their antiviral activity has not been reported. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) against a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO<sub>2</sub> on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO<sub>2</sub> activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO<sub>2</sub> treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral effects of zirconia nanoparticles against H5N1 virus but does not discuss viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: The Central Role of Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) in Influenza Biology and Infection.
Abstract: Influenza (flu) is a contagious viral disease, which targets the human respiratory tract and spreads throughout the world each year. Every year, influenza infects around 10% of the world population and between 290,000 and 650,000 people die from it according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a negative sense eight-segment single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 11 different proteins. The only control over influenza seasonal epidemic outbreaks around the world are vaccines, annually updated according to viral strains in circulation, but, because of high rates of mutation and recurrent genetic assortment, new viral strains of influenza are constantly emerging, increasing the likelihood of pandemics. Vaccination effectiveness is limited, calling for new preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the virus-host interactions. In particular, grasping the role of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and related known interactions in the host cell is pivotal to better understand the mechanisms of virus infection and replication, and thus propose more effective antiviral approaches. In this review, we assess the structure of NS1, its dynamics, and multiple functions and interactions, to highlight the central role of this protein in viral biology and its potential use as an effective therapeutic target to tackle seasonal and pandemic influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review article on NS1 protein functions and potential as therapeutic target, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: IRF5 Promotes Influenza Virus-Induced Inflammatory Responses in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Myeloid Cells and Murine Models.
Abstract: Recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) by the innate immune system triggers pathways that restrict viral replication, activate innate immune cells, and regulate adaptive immunity. However, excessive innate immune activation can exaggerate disease. The pathways promoting excessive activation are incompletely understood, with limited experimental models to investigate the mechanisms driving influenza virus-induced inflammation in humans. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that plays important roles in the induction of cytokines after viral sensing. In an <i>in vivo</i> model of IAV infection, IRF5 deficiency reduced IAV-driven immune pathology and associated inflammatory cytokine production, specifically reducing cytokine-producing myeloid cell populations in <i>Irf5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice but not impacting type 1 interferon (IFN) production or virus replication. Using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we identified that human lung IRF5 expression was highest in cells of the myeloid lineage. To investigate the role of IRF5 in mediating human inflammatory responses by myeloid cells to IAV, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) with biallelic mutations in <i>IRF5</i>, demonstrating for the first time that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dendritic cells (iPS-DCs) with biallelic mutations can be used to investigate the regulation of human virus-induced immune responses. Using this technology, we reveal that IRF5 deficiency in human DCs, or macrophages, corresponded with reduced virus-induced inflammatory cytokine production, with IRF5 acting downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and, possibly, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) after viral sensing. Thus, IRF5 acts as a regulator of myeloid cell inflammatory cytokine production during IAV infection in mice and humans and drives immune-mediated viral pathogenesis independently of type 1 IFN and virus replication.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The inflammatory response to influenza A virus (IAV) participates in infection control but contributes to disease severity. After viral detection, intracellular pathways are activated, initiating cytokine production, but these pathways are incompletely understood. We show that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) mediates IAV-induced inflammation and, in mice, drives pathology. This was independent of antiviral type 1 IFN and virus replication, implying that IRF5 could be specifically targeted to treat influenza virus-induced inflammation. We show for the first time that human iPSC technology can be exploited in genetic studies of virus-induced immune responses. Using this technology, we deleted IRF5 in human myeloid cells. These IRF5-deficient cells exhibited impaired influenza virus-induced cytokine production and revealed that IRF5 acts downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 and possibly retinoic acid-inducible gene I. Our data demonstrate the importance of IRF5 in influenza virus-induced inflammation, suggesting that genetic variation in the IRF5 gene may influence host susceptibility to viral diseases.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the role of IRF5 in host inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020.
Abstract: Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. We estimated the basic reproduction number <i>R0</i> of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.

Title: ACKR2 contributes to pulmonary dysfunction by shaping CCL5:CCR5-dependent recruitment of lymphocytes during influenza A infection in mice.
Abstract: Inflammation triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection is important for viral clearance, induction of adaptive responses, and return to lung homeostasis. However, an exaggerated immune response, characterized by the overproduction of chemokines, can lead to intense lung injury, contributing to mortality. Chemokine scavenger receptors, such as ACKR2, control the levels of CC chemokines influencing the immune responses. Among the chemokine targets of ACKR2, CCL5 is important to recruit and activate lymphocytes. We investigated the role of ACKR2 during IAV infection in mice. Pulmonary ACKR2 expression was increased acutely after IAV infection preceding the virus-induced lung dysfunction. ACKR2-knockout (ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were protected from IAV, presenting decreased viral burden and lung dysfunction. Mechanistically, the absence of ACKR2 resulted in augmented airway CCL5 levels, secreted by mononuclear and plasma cells in the lung parenchyma. The higher chemokine gradient led to an augmented recruitment of T and B lymphocytes, formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and production of IgA in the airways of ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice post-IAV. CCL5 neutralization in ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice prevented lymphocyte recruitment and increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein levels and pulmonary dysfunction. Finally, CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> mice presented increased disease severity during IAV infection, displaying increased neutrophils, pulmonary injury and dysfunction, and accentuated lethality. Collectively, our data showed that ACKR2 dampens CCL5 levels and the consequent recruitment of CCR5<sup>+</sup> T helper 1 (Th1), T regulatory cells (Tregs), and B lymphocytes during IAV infection, decreasing pathogen control and promoting lung dysfunction in wild type mice. Therefore, ACKR2 is detrimental and CCR5 is protective during IAV infection coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses in mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune response modulation (ACKR2 and CCR5) during influenza infection in mice without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Swine Influenza A Viruses and the Tangled Relationship with Humans.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are the causative agents of one of the most important viral respiratory diseases in pigs and humans. Human and swine IAV are prone to interspecies transmission, leading to regular incursions from human to pig and vice versa. This bidirectional transmission of IAV has heavily influenced the evolutionary history of IAV in both species. Transmission of distinct human seasonal lineages to pigs, followed by sustained within-host transmission and rapid adaptation and evolution, represent a considerable challenge for pig health and production. Consequently, although only subtypes of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are endemic in swine around the world, extensive diversity can be found in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, as well as the remaining six genes. We review the complicated global epidemiology of IAV in swine and the inextricably entangled implications for public health and influenza pandemic planning.

Title: Mouse adaptation of the H9N2 avian influenza virus causes the downregulation of genes related to innate immune responses and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in mice.
Abstract: H9N2 avian influenza viruses sporadically infect humans worldwide. These viruses have also contributed internal genes to H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which have been isolated from humans with infections and are a substantial public health threat. To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus, we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent H9N2 avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Shandong/416/2016 [SD/416]) in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus. We generated a mouse-adapted (MA) virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs, caused severe lung damage in mice, and induced body weight loss in mice; however, the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice. Global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that the transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct. The lungs of mice infected with the MA virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which was not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus. These data indicated that the MA virus might evade immune surveillance and changed its replication capacity to increase the viral replication level and pathogenicity. Our study demonstrates that host factors play an important role in the adaptive evolution of influenza virus in new hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host gene expression changes after mouse adaptation of H9N2 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: HopPER: an adaptive model for probability estimation of influenza reassortment through host prediction.
Abstract: Influenza reassortment, a mechanism where influenza viruses exchange their RNA segments by co-infecting a single cell, has been implicated in several major pandemics since 19th century. Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.

Title: Modulation of lethal HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4B infection in AIV pre-exposed mallards.
Abstract: In 2016/2017, a severe epidemic of HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 group B (H5N8B) affected Europe. To analyse the role of mallards in the spatiotemporal dynamics of global HPAIV H5N8B dispersal, mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>), naturally exposed to various AIV and therefore seropositive, were challenged with H5N8B. All experiments were controlled by infection and co-housing of seronegative juvenile Pekin ducklings. All ducks that survived the first infection were re-challenged 21 dpi with the homologous H5N8B strain. After the first H5N8B infection, seropositive mallards showed only mild clinical symptoms. Moderate to low viral shedding, occurring particularly from the oropharynx and lasting for 7 days maximum, led to severe clinical disease of all contact ducklings. All challenged seronegative Pekin ducks and contact ducklings died or had to be euthanized. H5-specific antibodies were detected in surviving birds within 2 weeks. Virus and viral RNA could be isolated from several water samples until 6 and 9 dpi, respectively. Conversely, upon re-infection with homologous H5N8B neither inoculated nor contact ducklings showed any clinical symptoms, nor was an antibody titer increase of seropositive mallards or any seroconversion of contact ducklings observed. Mallard ducks naturally pre-exposed to LPAIV can play a role as a clinically unsuspicious virus reservoir for H5N8B effective in virus transmission. Mallards with homologous immunity did not contribute to virus transmission.

Title: Pathobiological Origins and Evolutionary History of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: High-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have arisen from low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses via changes in the hemagglutinin proteolytic cleavage site, which include mutation of multiple nonbasic to basic amino acids, duplication of basic amino acids, or recombination with insertion of cellular or viral amino acids. Between 1959 and 2019, a total of 42 natural, independent H5 (<i>n</i> = 15) and H7 (<i>n</i> = 27) LPAI to HPAI virus conversion events have occurred in Europe (<i>n</i> = 16), North America (<i>n</i> = 9), Oceania (<i>n</i> = 7), Asia (<i>n</i> = 5), Africa (<i>n</i> = 4), and South America (<i>n</i> = 1). Thirty-eight of these HPAI outbreaks were limited in the number of poultry premises affected and were eradicated. However, poultry outbreaks caused by A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5Nx), Mexican H7N3, and Chinese H7N9 HPAI lineages have continued. Active surveillance and molecular detection and characterization efforts will provide the best opportunity for early detection and eradication from domestic birds.

Title: Microtubules in Influenza Virus Entry and Egress.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens that represent a significant threat to public health, despite the large-scale implementation of vaccination programs. It is necessary to understand the detailed and complex interactions between influenza virus and its host cells in order to identify successful strategies for therapeutic intervention. During viral entry, the cellular microenvironment presents invading pathogens with a series of obstacles that must be overcome to infect permissive cells. Influenza hijacks numerous host cell proteins and associated biological pathways during its journey into the cell, responding to environmental cues in order to successfully replicate. The cellular cytoskeleton and its constituent microtubules represent a heavily exploited network during viral infection. Cytoskeletal filaments provide a dynamic scaffold for subcellular viral trafficking, as well as virus-host interactions with cellular machineries that are essential for efficient uncoating, replication, and egress. In addition, influenza virus infection results in structural changes in the microtubule network, which itself has consequences for viral replication. Microtubules, their functional roles in normal cell biology, and their exploitation by influenza viruses will be the focus of this review.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review focuses on host cell microtubules' role in influenza virus entry and egress without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Select targeting of intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor resistance domains for protection against influenza-induced disease.
Abstract: TLRs are a family of PRRs that respond to PAMPs or host-derived Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) to initiate host inflammation and immune responses. TLR dimerization and recruitment of adapter molecules is critical for intracellular signaling and is mediated through intracellular Toll-Interleukin 1 Receptor Resistance (TIR) domain interactions. Human TIR domains, including reported structures of TIR1, TIR2, TIR6, TIR10, TIRAP, and MyD88, contain Cysteine (Cys) interactions or modifications that are disproportionally at, or near, reported biological TIR interfaces, or in close proximity to functionally important regions. Therefore, we hypothesized that intracellular TIR Cys regulation may have greater functional importance than previously appreciated. Expression of mutant TLR4-C747S or treatment of TLR4 reporter cells with a small molecule, Cys-binding inhibitor of TLR4, TAK-242, abrogated LPS signaling <i>in vitro</i>. Using TAK-242, mice were protected from lethal influenza challenge as previously reported for extracellular TLR4 antagonists. Molecular modeling and sequence analysis of the region surrounding TLR4-Cys747 indicate conservation of a WxxxE motif identified among bacterial and NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming TIRs, as well as within the TIRs domains of surface TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Together, these data support the hypothesis that critical Cys within the TIR domain are essential for TLR4 functionality.

Title: Influenza A and B in a cohort of outpatient children and adolescent with influenza like-illness during two consecutive influenza seasons.
Abstract: Influenza is an important cause of morbimortality worldwide. Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.

Title: Quantitative efficacy paradigms of the influenza clinical drug candidate EIDD-2801 in the ferret model.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza viruses cause major morbidity and mortality worldwide, threatening in particular older adults and the immunocompromised. Two classes of influenza therapeutics dominate current disease management, but both are compromised by pre-existing or rapidly emerging viral resistance. We have recently reported a novel ribonucleoside analog clinical candidate, EIDD-2801, that combines potent antiviral efficacy in ferrets and human airway epithelium cultures with a high barrier against viral escape. In this study, we established fundamental EIDD-2801 efficacy paradigms against pandemic and seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) strains in ferrets that can be used to inform exposure targets and treatment regimens. Based on reduction of shed virus titers, alleviation of clinical signs, and lowered virus burden in upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, lowest efficacious oral dose concentrations of EIDD-2801, given twice daily, were 2.3 and 7 mg/kg of body weight against seasonal and pandemic IAVs, respectively. The latest opportunity for initiation of efficacious treatment was 36 hours after infection of ferrets. Administered in 12-hour intervals, three 7 mg/kg doses of EIDD-2801 were sufficient for maximal therapeutic benefit against a pandemic IAV and significantly shortened the time to resolution of clinical signs. Ferrets infected with pandemic IAV and treated following the minimally efficacious EIDD-2801 regimen demonstrated significantly less shed virus and inflammatory cellular infiltrates in nasal lavages, but mounted a robust humoral antiviral response after recovery that was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated animals. These results provide an experimental basis in a human disease-relevant influenza animal model for clinical testing of EIDD-2801.

Title: Genetic characterization of influenza A(H3N2) viruses circulating in coastal Kenya, 2009-2017.
Abstract: Influenza viruses evolve rapidly and undergo immune driven selection, especially in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. We report amino acid changes affecting antigenic epitopes and receptor-binding sites of A(H3N2) viruses circulating in Kilifi, Kenya, from 2009 to 2017. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to generate A(H3N2) virus genomic data from influenza-positive specimens collected from hospital admissions and health facility outpatients presenting with acute respiratory illness to health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Full-length HA sequences were utilized to characterize A(H3N2) virus genetic and antigenic changes. From 186 (90 inpatient and 96 outpatient) influenza A virus-positive specimens processed, 101 A(H3N2) virus whole genomes were obtained. Among viruses identified in inpatient specimens from 2009 to 2015, divergence of circulating A(H3N2) viruses from the vaccine strains A/Perth/16/2009, A/Texas/50/2012, and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 formed 6 genetic clades (A/Victoria/208/2009-like, 3B, 3C, 3C.2a, 4, and 7). Among viruses identified in outpatient specimens from 2015 to 2017, divergence of circulating A(H3N2) viruses from vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 formed clade 3C.2a, subclades 3C.2a2 and 3C.2a3, and subgroup 3C.2a1b. Several amino acid substitutions were associated with the continued genetic evolution of A(H3N2) strains in circulation. Our results suggest continuing evolution of currently circulating A(H3N2) viruses in Kilifi, coastal Kenya and suggest the need for continuous genetic and antigenic viral surveillance of circulating seasonal influenza viruses with broad geographic representation to facilitate prompt and efficient selection of influenza strains for inclusion in future influenza vaccines.

Title: Identification and Characterization of Novel Compounds with Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity against Influenza A and B Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses are highly contagious pathogens that cause fatal respiratory disease every year, with high economic impact. In addition, IAV can cause pandemic infections with great consequences when new viruses are introduced into humans. In this study, we evaluated 10 previously described compounds with antiviral activity against mammarenaviruses for their ability to inhibit IAV infection using our recently described bireporter influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) H1N1 (BIRFLU). Among the 10 tested compounds, eight (antimycin A [AmA], brequinar [BRQ], 6-azauridine, azaribine, pyrazofurin [PF], AVN-944, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], and mycophenolic acid [MPA]), but not obatoclax or Osu-03012, showed potent anti-influenza virus activity under posttreatment conditions [median 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) = 3.80 nM to 1.73 μM; selective index SI for 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, >28.90 to 13,157.89]. AmA, 6-azauridine, azaribine, and PF also showed potent inhibitory effect in pretreatment (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.14 μM to 0.55 μM; SI-MTT = 70.12 to >357.14) or cotreatment (EC<sub>50</sub> = 34.69 nM to 7.52 μM; SI-MTT = 5.24 to > 1,441.33) settings. All of the compounds tested inhibited viral genome replication and gene transcription, and none of them affected host cellular RNA polymerase II activities. The antiviral activity of the eight identified compounds against BIRFLU was further confirmed with seasonal IAVs (A/California/04/2009 H1N1 and A/Wyoming/3/2003 H3N2) and an IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008, Victoria lineage), demonstrating their broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic activity against currently circulating influenza viruses in humans. Together, our results identified a new set of antiviral compounds for the potential treatment of influenza viral infections.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza viruses are highly contagious pathogens and are a major threat to human health. Vaccination remains the most effective tool to protect humans against influenza infection. However, vaccination does not always guarantee complete protection against drifted or, more noticeably, shifted influenza viruses. Although U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs are approved for the treatment of influenza infections, influenza viruses resistant to current FDA antivirals have been reported and continue to emerge. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find novel antivirals for the treatment of influenza viral infections in humans, a search that could be expedited by repurposing currently approved drugs. In this study, we assessed the influenza antiviral activity of 10 compounds previously shown to inhibit mammarenavirus infection. Among them, eight drugs showed antiviral activities, providing a new battery of drugs that could be used for the treatment of influenza infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral compounds' efficacy but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of a Reassortant H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus with Intercontinental Gene Segments in a Resident Australian Chestnut Teal.
Abstract: The present study reports the genetic characterization of a low-pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus, initially from a pool and subsequently from individual faecal samples collected from Chestnut teals (<i>Anas castanea</i>) in southeastern Australia. Phylogenetic analyses of six full gene segments and two partial gene segments obtained from next-generation sequencing showed that this avian influenza virus, A/Chestnut teal/Australia/CT08.18/12952/2018 (H9N2), was a typical, low-pathogenicity, Eurasian aquatic bird lineage H9N2 virus, albeit containing the North American lineage nucleoprotein (NP) gene segment detected previously in Australian wild birds. This is the first report of a H9N2 avian influenza virus in resident wild birds in Australia, and although not in itself a cause of concern, is a clear indication of spillover and likely reassortment of influenza viruses between migratory and resident birds, and an indication that any lineage could potentially be introduced in this way.
Relevant: False

Title: Assessing the susceptibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses to oseltamivir using embryonated chicken eggs.
Abstract: The susceptibility of influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) is studied using enzyme-based assays, sequence analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) is the active prodrug of the NAI oseltamivir. There is lack of information on the use of embryonated chicken eggs for studying susceptibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses to antiviral drugs. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs for studying antiviral susceptibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Two HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from India were used in the study. Fluorescence-based NAI assay was performed to determine antiviral susceptibility of these viruses. In ovo antiviral assays were carried out using 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs. The virus dilutions were incubated with 14 μg/ml of OC and inoculated in the allantoic cavity. In the eggs, 50 per cent egg infectious dose (EID<sub>50</sub>) titres as well as mortality were quantitated. The two viruses used were susceptible to OC in the NAI assay. It was found that there was a significant drop in EID<sub>50</sub>titres; however, no significant protection from mortality after OC treatment was observed. By measuring viral titres, the egg model was suitable to study the susceptibility of HPAI viruses to antiviral drugs along with NAI assay. The present study highlights the use of eggs as a model to study susceptibility of HPAI viruses to OC.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper assesses antiviral susceptibility using embryonated eggs but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Structural and Functional Aspects of G-Quadruplex Aptamers Which Bind a Broad Range of Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: An aptamer is a synthetic oligonucleotide with a unique spatial structure that provides specific binding to a target. To date, several aptamers to hemagglutinin of the influenza A virus have been described, which vary in affinity and strain specificity. Among them, the DNA aptamer RHA0385 is able to recognize influenza hemagglutinins with highly variable sequences. In this paper, the structure of RHA0385 was studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and size-exclusion chromatography, demonstrating the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex structure. Three derivatives of RHA0385 were designed in order to determine the contribution of the major loop to affinity. Shortening of the major loop from seven to three nucleotides led to stabilization of the scaffold. The affinities of the derivatives were studied by surface plasmon resonance and an enzyme-linked aptamer assay on recombinant hemagglutinins and viral particles, respectively. The alterations in the loop affected the binding to influenza hemagglutinin, but did not abolish it. Contrary to aptamer RHA0385, two of the designed aptamers were shown to be conformationally homogeneous, retaining high affinities and broad binding abilities for both recombinant hemagglutinins and whole influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies aptamer binding to influenza hemagglutinin but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Alignment-free genomic sequence comparison using FCGR and signal processing.
Abstract: Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing "nearby" species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees. We describe one such method that gives quite strong results. We use the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) to create images from such sequences, We then reduce dimension, first using a Fourier trig transform, followed by a Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). This gives vectors of modest length. These in turn are used for fast sequence lookup, construction of phylogenetic trees, and classification of virus genomic data. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach on several benchmark test sets. The tandem of FCGR and dimension reductions using Fourier-type transforms and SVD provides a powerful approach for alignment-free genomic comparison. Results compare favorably and often surpass best results reported in prior literature. Good scalability is also observed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes an alignment-free genomic comparison method without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Synthetic Virology: Building Viruses to Better Understand Them.
Abstract: Generally comprised of less than a dozen components, RNA viruses can be viewed as well-designed genetic circuits optimized to replicate and spread within a given host. Understanding the molecular design that enables this activity not only allows one to disrupt these circuits to study their biology, but it provides a reprogramming framework to achieve novel outputs. Recent advances have enabled a "learning by building" approach to better understand virus biology and create valuable tools. Below is a summary of how modifying the preexisting genetic framework of influenza A virus has been used to track viral movement, understand virus replication, and identify host factors that engage this viral circuitry.
Relevant: False

Title: H9 Influenza Viruses: An Emerging Challenge.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the H9 subtype are enzootic in Asia, the Middle East, and parts of North and Central Africa, where they cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Of note, some strains of H9N2 viruses have been linked to zoonotic episodes of mild respiratory diseases. Because of the threat posed by H9N2 viruses to poultry and human health, these viruses are considered of pandemic concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). H9N2 IAVs continue to diversify into multiple antigenically and phylogenetically distinct lineages that can further promote the emergence of strains with pandemic potential. Somewhat neglected compared with the H5 and H7 subtypes, there are numerous indicators that H9N2 viruses could be involved directly or indirectly in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic. The goal of this work is to discuss the state of knowledge on H9N2 IAVs and to provide an update on the contemporary global situation.

Title: The 1918 Influenza Pandemic and Its Legacy.
Abstract: Just over a century ago in 1918-1919, the "Spanish" influenza pandemic appeared nearly simultaneously around the world and caused extraordinary mortality-estimated at 50-100 million fatalities-associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The pandemic's sudden appearance and high fatality rate were unprecedented, and 100 years later still serve as a stark reminder of the continual threat influenza poses. Sequencing and reconstruction of the 1918 virus have allowed scientists to answer many questions about its origin and pathogenicity, although many questions remain. Several of the unusual features of the 1918-1919 pandemic, including age-specific mortality patterns and the high frequency of severe pneumonias, are still not fully understood. The 1918 pandemic virus initiated a pandemic era still ongoing. The descendants of the 1918 virus remain today as annually circulating and evolving influenza viruses causing significant mortality each year. This review summarizes key findings and unanswered questions about this deadliest of human events.

Title: Bat-Borne Influenza A Viruses: An Awakening.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) originating from aquatic waterfowl recurrently cross interspecies barriers, which is greatly facilitated by utilizing cell surface-exposed monosaccharide sialic acids located on vertebrate cells as a universal host cell receptor. These glycan structures are first bound by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) for cell entry and then cleaved by the viral neuraminidase (NA) for particle release. In contrast, viruses of the recently identified bat-borne IAV subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 encode HA and NA homologs unable to interact with sialic acid residues despite a high degree of structural homology with their conventional counterparts. However, the most recent findings show that bat IAV HAs make use of the major histocompatibility complex class II proteins of different vertebrate species to gain entry into host cells, potentially permitting a broader host tropism. This review recapitulates current progress in the field of bat IAV research including the first assessment of the spillover potential of these bat viruses into other mammals.

Title: Human matriptase/ST 14 proteolytically cleaves H7N9 hemagglutinin and facilitates the activation of influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus in cell culture.
Abstract: Influenza is a zoonotic disease that infects millions of people each year resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, and in turn devastating pandemics. Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory-confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage-activation. We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ST 14-activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells. Finally, human matriptase/ST 14 also activated H7N9 live virus which resulted in high infectivity. Our data demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a likely candidate protease to promote H7N9 infections in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of human matriptase/ST 14 protease in cleaving H7N9 hemagglutinin and facilitating virus activation, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prion Protein is a Novel Modulator of Influenza: Potential Implications for Anti-Influenza Therapeutics.
Abstract: Worldwide spread of influenza A virus (IAV) strains, which are resistant to currently available anti- influenza agents such as viral neuraminidase inhibitors, has encouraged identification of new target molecules for anti-influenza agents. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing oxidative stress play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injuries induced by infection with IAVs, therefore suggesting that anti-oxidative therapeutics targeting cellular molecules could be beneficial against IAV infection without inducing drug-resistant IAV strains. We recently found that the normal cellular prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>, whose conformational conversion into the amyloidogenic isoform, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, in the brain is a key pathogenic event in prion diseases, is expressed by lung epithelial cells and exerts a protective role against IAV infection in mice by reducing ROS in infected lungs. The Cu content and activity of anti- oxidative enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, were lower in the lungs of PrP<sup>C</sup>-knockout mice, suggesting that the anti-oxidative activity of PrP<sup>C</sup> is probably attributable to its function of activating SOD1 through regulating Cu content in lungs. Here, we introduce PrP<sup>C</sup> as a novel modulator of influenza and its potential implication for anti-oxidative therapies for IAV infection. We also introduce other candidate targets reported for anti- oxidative anti-influenza therapies.

Reason: The paper discusses the role of prion protein as a modulator of influenza infection and potential therapeutic implications but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Next-Generation Sequencing: An Eye-Opener for the Surveillance of Antiviral Resistance in Influenza.
Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can enable a more effective response to a wide range of communicable disease threats, such as influenza, which is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. After vaccination, antivirals are the second line of defense against influenza. The use of currently available antivirals can lead to antiviral resistance mutations in the entire influenza genome. Therefore, the methods to detect these mutations should be developed and implemented. In this Opinion, we assess how NGS could be implemented to detect drug resistance mutations in clinical influenza virus isolates.

Title: Statistical characteristics of amino acid covariance as possible descriptors of viral genomic complexity.
Abstract: At the sequence level it is hard to describe the complexity of viruses which allows them to challenge host immune system, some for a few weeks and others up to a complete compromise. Paradoxically, viral genomes are both complex and simple. Complex because amino acid mutation rates are very high, and yet viruses remain functional. Simple because they have barely around 10 types of proteins, so viral protein-protein interaction networks are not insightful. In this work we use fine-grained amino acid level information and their evolutionary characteristics obtained from large-scale genomic data to develop a statistical panel, towards the goal of developing quantitative descriptors for the biological complexity of viruses. Networks were constructed from pairwise covariation of amino acids and were statistically analyzed. Three differentiating factors arise: predominantly intra- vs inter-protein covariance relations, the nature of the node degree distribution and network density. Interestingly, the covariance relations were primarily intra-protein in avian influenza and inter-protein in HIV. The degree distributions showed two universality classes: a power-law with exponent -1 in HIV and avian-influenza, random behavior in human flu and dengue. The calculated covariance network density correlates well with the mortality strengths of viruses on the viral-Richter scale. These observations suggest the potential utility of the statistical metrics for describing the covariance patterns in viruses. Our host-virus interaction analysis point to the possibility that host proteins which can interact with multiple viral proteins may be responsible for shaping the inter-protein covariance relations. With the available data, it appears that network density might be a surrogate for the virus Richter scale, however the hypothesis needs a re-examination when large scale complete genome data for more viruses becomes available.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops statistical descriptors of viral genomic complexity based on amino acid covariance but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Incorporating heterogeneous sampling probabilities in continuous phylogeographic inference - Application to H5N1 spread in the Mekong region.
Abstract: The potentially low precision associated with the geographic origin of sampled sequences represents an important limitation for spatially explicit (i.e. continuous) phylogeographic inference of fast-evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses. A substantial proportion of publicly available sequences is geo-referenced at broad spatial scale such as the administrative unit of origin, rather than more precise locations (e.g. geographic coordinates). Most frequently, such sequences are either discarded prior to continuous phylogeographic inference or arbitrarily assigned to the geographic coordinates of the centroid of their administrative area of origin for lack of a better alternative. We here implement and describe a new approach that allows to incorporate heterogeneous prior sampling probabilities over a geographic area. External data, such as outbreak locations, are used to specify these prior sampling probabilities over a collection of sub-polygons. We apply this new method to the analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade data in the Mekong region. Our method allows to properly include, in continuous phylogeographic analyses, H5N1 sequences that are only associated with large administrative areas of origin and assign them with more accurate locations. Finally, we use continuous phylogeographic reconstructions to analyse the dispersal dynamics of different H5N1 clades and investigate the impact of environmental factors on lineage dispersal velocities. Our new method allowing heterogeneous sampling priors for continuous phylogeographic inference is implemented in the open-source multi-platform software package BEAST 1.10. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Title: Spatiotemporal reconstruction and transmission dynamics during the 2016-17 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic in Italy.
Abstract: Effective control of avian diseases in domestic populations requires understanding of the transmission dynamics facilitating viral emergence and spread. In 2016-17, Italy experienced a significant avian influenza epidemic caused by a highly pathogenic A(H5N8) virus, which affected domestic premises housing around 2.7 million birds, primarily in the north-eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the success of control measures. Using an approach based on phylogenetic-temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the presence of cryptic wild bird-mediated transmission, information that can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from incursions across the wildlife-domestic interface, a common challenge in veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with occasional long-distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of human-mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked domestic cases are unusually high.

Title: Breaking the Convention: Sialoglycan Variants, Coreceptors, and Alternative Receptors for Influenza A Virus Entry.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) envelope protein hemagglutinin binds α2,6- or α2,3-linked sialic acid as a host cell receptor. Bat IAV subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 form an exception to this rule and do not bind sialic acid but enter cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Here, we review current knowledge on IAV receptors with a focus on sialoglycan variants, protein coreceptors, and alternative receptors that impact IAV attachment and internalization beyond the well-described sialic acid binding.

Title: Global virus outbreaks: Interferons as 1st responders.
Abstract: Outbreaks of severe virus infections with the potential to cause global pandemics are increasing. In many instances these outbreaks have been newly emerging (SARS coronavirus), re-emerging (Ebola virus, Zika virus) or zoonotic (avian influenza H5N1) virus infections. In the absence of a targeted vaccine or a pathogen-specific antiviral, broad-spectrum antivirals would function to limit virus spread. Given the direct antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in inhibiting the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses at different stages of their replicative cycles, and the effects of type I IFNs on activating immune cell populations to clear virus infections, IFNs-α/β present as ideal candidate broad-spectrum antivirals.

Title: First report of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus in Oman: The need for a One Health approach.
Abstract: Following the detection of the first human case of avian influenza A subtype H9N2 in 1998, more than 40 cases were diagnosed worldwide. However, the spread of the virus has been more remarkable and significant in global poultry populations, causing notable economic losses despite its low pathogenicity. Many surveillance studies and activities conducted in several countries have shown the predominance of this virus subtype. We present the case of a 14-month-old female in Oman with an A(H9N2) virus infection. This is the first human case of A(H9N2) reported from Oman and the Gulf Cooperation Countries, and Oman is the second country outside of southern and eastern Asia to report a case (cases have also been detected in Egypt). The patient had bronchial asthma and presented with a high-grade temperature and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection that necessitated admission to a high dependency unit in a tertiary care hospital. It is of urgency that a multisector One Health approach be established to combat the threat of avian influenza at the animal-human interface. In addition to enhancements of surveillance and control in poultry, there is a need to develop screening and preventive programs for high-risk occupations.

Title: Disentangling the role of Africa in the global spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Abstract: The role of Africa in the dynamics of the global spread of a zoonotic and economically-important virus, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx of the Gs/GD lineage, remains unexplored. Here we characterise the spatiotemporal patterns of virus diffusion during three HPAI H5Nx intercontinental epidemic waves and demonstrate that Africa mainly acted as an ecological sink of the HPAI H5Nx viruses. A joint analysis of host dynamics and continuous spatial diffusion indicates that poultry trade as well as wild bird migrations have contributed to the virus spreading into Africa, with West Africa acting as a crucial hotspot for virus introduction and dissemination into the continent. We demonstrate varying paths of avian influenza incursions into Africa as well as virus spread within Africa over time, which reveal that virus expansion is a complex phenomenon, shaped by an intricate interplay between avian host ecology, virus characteristics and environmental variables.

Title: IFITM3 and type I interferons are important for the control of influenza A virus replication in murine macrophages.
Abstract: Abortive infection of macrophages serves as a "dead end" for most seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) strains, and it is likely to contribute to effective host defence. Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) restricts the early stages of IAV replication in epithelial cells, but IFITM3 restriction of IAV replication in macrophages has not been previously investigated. Herein, macrophages isolated from IFITM3-deficient mice were more susceptible to initial IAV infection, but late-stage viral replication was still controlled through abortive infection. Strikingly, IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR)-deficient macrophages infected with IAV were not only more susceptible to initial infection, but these cells also supported productive viral replication. Significantly, we have established that abortive IAV infection in macrophages is controlled through a type I IFN-dependent mechanism, where late-stage IAV replication can proceed in the absence of type I IFN responses. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into macrophage-specific processes that potently shut down IAV replication.

Rearrangements of MLL protein (MLL-r) in complexes that contain the histone methyltransferase DOT1L are common, which elicit abnormal methylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 at MLL target genes. Phase 1 clinical studies with pinometostat (EPZ-5676), an inhibitor of DOT1L activity, demonstrated the therapeutic potential for targeting DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia patients. We previously reported that down-regulation of DOT1L increases influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication and decreases the antiviral response. Here we show that DOT1L inhibition also reduces Sendai virus-induced innate response and its overexpression decreases influenza virus multiplication, reinforcing the notion of DOT1L controlling viral replication. Accordingly, genes involved in the host innate response against pathogens (RUBICON, TRIM25, BCL3) are deregulated in human lung epithelial cells treated with pinometostat. Concomitantly, deregulation of some of these genes together with that of the MicroRNA let-7B, may account for the beneficial effects of pinometostat treatment in patients with MLL-r involving DOT1L. These results support a possible increased vulnerability to infection in MLL-r leukemia patients undergoing pinometostat treatment. Close follow up of infection should be considered in pinometostat therapy to reduce some severe side effects during the treatment.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host response modulation by a drug and its effects on viral replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Off-target effects of an insect cell-expressed influenza HA-pseudotyped Gag-VLP preparation in limiting postinfluenza Staphylococcus aureus infections.
Abstract: Clinical and historical data underscore the ability of influenza viruses to ally with Staphylococcus aureus and predispose the host for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which is a leading cause of influenza-associated mortality. This is fundamental because no vaccine for S. aureus is available and the number of antibiotic-resistant strains is alarmingly rising. Hence, this leaves influenza vaccination the only strategy to prevent postinfluenza staphylococcal infections. In the present work, we assessed the off-target effects of a Tnms42 insect cell-expressed BEI-treated Gag-VLP preparation expressing the HA of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) in preventing S. aureus superinfection in mice pre-infected with a homologous or heterologous H1N1 viral challenge strain. Our results demonstrate that matched anti-hemagglutinin immunity elicited by a VLP preparation may suffice to prevent morbidity and mortality caused by lethal secondary bacterial infection. This effect was observed even when employing a single low antigen dose of 50 ng HA per animal. However, induction of anti-hemagglutinin immunity alone was not helpful in inhibiting heterologous viral replication and subsequent bacterial infection. Our results indicate the potential of the VLP vaccine approach in terms of immunogenicity but suggest that anti-HA immunity should not be considered as the sole preventive method for combatting influenza and postinfluenza bacterial infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses vaccine effects on secondary bacterial infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular Characterization of a Novel Avian Influenza A (H2N9) Strain Isolated from Wild Duck in Korea in 2018.
Abstract: A novel avian influenza virus (A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018) (H2N9) was isolated from wild birds in South Korea in 2018, and phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted on complete gene sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) virus belonged to the Eurasian countries, whereas other internal genes (polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), PB2, nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein (M), and non-structural protein (NS)) belonged to the East Asian countries. A monobasic amino acid (PQIEPR/GLF) at the HA cleavage site, E627 in the PB2 gene, and no deletion of the stalk region in the NA gene indicated that the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) isolate was a typical low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). Nucleotide sequence similarity analysis of HA revealed that the highest homology (98.34%) is to that of A/duck/Mongolia/482/2015 (H2N3), and amino acid sequence of NA was closely related to that of A/duck/Bangladesh/8987/2010 (H10N9) (96.45%). In contrast, internal genes showed homology higher than 98% compared to those of other isolates derived from duck and wild birds of China or Japan in 2016-2018. The newly isolated A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) strain is the first reported avian influenza virus in Korea, and may have evolved from multiple genotypes in wild birds and ducks in Mongolia, China, and Japan.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on molecular and phylogenetic characterization of a novel H2N9 strain, describing gene origins and sequence homology, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Passage of influenza A/H3N2 viruses in human airway cells removes artefactual variants associated with neuraminidase-mediated binding.
Abstract: Serological assays with modern influenza A/H3N2 viruses have become problematic due to the progressive reduction in the ability of viruses of this subtype to bind and agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs). This is due to reduced ability of the viral haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein to bind to the sialic acid-containing receptors presented by these cells. Additionally, as a result of reduced HA-mediated binding in cell culture, modern A/H3N2 viruses often acquire compensatory mutations during propagation that enable binding of cellular receptors through their neuraminidase (NA) surface protein. Viruses that have acquired this NA-mediated binding agglutinate RBCs through their NA, confusing the results of serological assays designed to assess HA antigenicity. Here we confirm with a large dataset that the acquisition of mutations that confer NA binding of RBCs is a culture artefact, and demonstrate that modern A/H3N2 isolates with acquired NA-binding mutations revert to a clinical-like NA sequence after a single passage in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on culture-induced mutations affecting neuraminidase-mediated binding as an artifact during virus propagation, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypic traits in natural infection contexts.

Title: The G Protein-Coupled Receptor FFAR2 Promotes Internalization during Influenza A Virus Entry.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) coopts numerous host factors to complete its replication cycle. Here, we identify free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) as a cofactor for IAV entry into host cells. We found that downregulation of FFAR2 or Ffar2 expression significantly reduced the replication of IAV in A549 or RAW 264.7 cells. The treatment of A549 cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting <i>FFAR2</i> or the FFAR2 pathway agonists 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-<i>N</i>-(thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (4-CMTB) and compound 58 (Cmp58) [(<i>S</i>)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-<i>N</i>-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide] dramatically inhibited the nuclear accumulation of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at early time points postinfection, indicating that FFAR2 functions in the early stage of the IAV replication cycle. FFAR2 downregulation had no effect on the expression of sialic acid (SA) receptors on the cell membrane, the attachment of IAV to the SA receptors, or the activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. Rather, the amount of internalized IAVs was significantly reduced in FFAR2-knocked-down or 4-CMTB- or Cmp58-treated A549 cells. Further studies showed that FFAR2 associated with β-arrestin1 and that β-arrestin1 interacted with the β2-subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP2B1), the essential adaptor of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Notably, siRNA knockdown of either β-arrestin1 or AP2B1 dramatically impaired IAV replication, and AP2B1 knockdown or treatment with Barbadin, an inhibitor targeting the β-arrestin1/AP2B1 complex, remarkably decreased the amount of internalized IAVs. Moreover, we found that FFAR2 interacted with three G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (i.e., GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6) whose downregulation inhibited IAV replication. Together, our findings demonstrate that the FFAR2 signaling cascade is important for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To complete its replication cycle, IAV hijacks the host endocytosis machinery to invade cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of how IAV is internalized into host cells remain poorly understood, emphasizing the need to elucidate the role of host factors in IAV entry into cells. In this study, we identified FFAR2 as an important host factor for the efficient replication of both low-pathogenic and highly pathogenic IAV. We revealed that FFAR2 facilitates the internalization of IAV into target cells during the early stage of infection. Upon further characterization of the role of FFAR2-associated proteins in virus replication, we found that the FFAR2-β-arrestin1-AP2B1 signaling cascade is important for the efficient endocytosis of IAV. Our findings thus further our understanding of the biological details of IAV entry into host cells and establish FFAR2 as a potential target for antiviral drug development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a host factor (FFAR2) involved in influenza virus entry and replication, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Aptamer Profiling of A549 Cells Infected with Low-Pathogenicity and High-Pathogenicity Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important animal and human emerging and re-emerging pathogens that are responsible for yearly seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains, to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study, we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), a seasonal H1N1 (RV733), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09), or with two avian strains, an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan<sup>®</sup>) to examine >1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains, and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation, primarily by upregulating many immune molecules, the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules, and the avian strains induced significant downregulation, primarily in antimicrobial response, cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study profiles host cell proteomic changes upon infection with various influenza strains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Frustration and fidelity in influenza genome assembly.
Abstract: The genome of the influenza virus consists of eight distinct single-stranded RNA segments, each encoding proteins essential for the viral life cycle. When the virus infects a host cell, these segments must be replicated and packaged into new budding virions. The viral genome is assembled with remarkably high fidelity: experiments reveal that most virions contain precisely one copy of each of the eight RNA segments. Cell-biological studies suggest that genome assembly is mediated by specific reversible and irreversible interactions between the RNA segments and their associated proteins. However, the precise inter-segment interaction network remains unresolved. Here, we computationally predict that tree-like irreversible interaction networks guarantee high-fidelity genome assembly, while cyclic interaction networks lead to futile or frustrated off-pathway products. We test our prediction against multiple experimental datasets. We find that tree-like networks capture the nearest-neighbour statistics of RNA segments in packaged virions, as observed by electron tomography. Just eight tree-like networks (of a possible 262 144) optimally capture both the nearest-neighbour data and independently measured RNA-RNA binding and co-localization propensities. These eight do not include the previously proposed hub-and-spoke and linear networks. Rather, each predicted network combines hub-like and linear features, consistent with evolutionary models of interaction gain and loss.
Relevant: False
Reason: This computational study models influenza genome assembly networks without direct experimental linkage of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Continuous influenza virus production in a tubular bioreactor system provides stable titers and avoids the "von Magnus effect".
Abstract: Continuous cell culture-based influenza vaccine production could significantly reduce footprint and manufacturing costs compared to current batch processing. However, yields of influenza virus in continuous mode can be affected by oscillations in virus titers caused by periodic accumulation of defective interfering particles. The generation of such particles has also been observed previously in cascades of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and is known as the "von Magnus effect". To improve virus yields and to avoid these oscillations, we have developed a novel continuous tubular bioreactor system for influenza A virus production. It was built using a 500 mL CSTR for cell growth linked to a 105 m long tubular plug-flow bioreactor (PFBR). Virus propagation took place only in the PFBR with a nominal residence time of 20 h and a production capacity of 0.2 mL/min. The bioreactor was first tested with suspension MDCK cells at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), and then with suspension avian AGE1.CR.pIX cells at a fixed nominal MOI of 0.02. Maximum hemagglutinin (HA) titers of 2.4 and 1.6 log10(HA units/100 μL) for suspension MDCK cells and AGE1.CR.pIX cells, respectively, were obtained. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that 100% infected cells with batch-like HA titers can be obtained at a MOI of at least 0.1. Stable HA and TCID50 titers over 18 days of production were confirmed using the AGE1.CR.pIX cell line, and PCR analysis demonstrated stable production of full-length genome. The contamination level of segments with deletions (potentially defective interfering particles), already present in the virus seed, was low and did not increase. Control experiments using batch and semi-continuous cultures confirmed these findings. A comparison showed that influenza virus production can be achieved with the tubular bioreactor system in about half the time with a space-time-yield up to two times higher than for typical batch cultures. In summary, a novel continuous tubular bioreactor system for cell culture-based influenza virus production was developed. One main advantage, an essentially single-passage amplification of viruses, should enable efficient production of vaccines as well as vectors for gene and cancer therapy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a novel bioreactor system for influenza virus production, focusing on process engineering rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Nanobody-based sandwich reporter system for living cell sensing influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The influenza epidemic is a huge burden to public health. Current influenza vaccines provide limited protection against new variants due to frequent mutation of the virus. The continual emergence of novel variants necessitates the method rapidly monitoring influenza virus infection in experimental systems. Although several replication-competent reporter viruses carrying fluorescent proteins or small luciferase have been generated in previous studies, visualizing influenza virus infection via such strategy requires reverse genetic modification for each viral strain which is usually time-consuming and inconvenient. Here, we created a novel influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) dependent reporter gene transcription activation module using NP-specific nanobodies. Our results demonstrated the modular design allowed reporter genes (mNeonGreen fluorescent protein and Gaussia luciferase) specifically expressing to detect intracellular NP protein, and therefore acts as a universal biosensor to monitor infection of various influenza A subtypes in living cells. The new system may provide a powerful tool to analyze influenza A infections at the cellular level to facilitate new antiviral drug discovery. Moreover, this approach may easily extend to develop live-cell biosensors for other viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study develops a nanobody-based reporter system to detect influenza infection, focusing on detection technology rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Metabolomic Analysis of Influenza A Virus A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) Infected A549 Cells during First Cycle of Viral Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) has developed strategies to utilize host metabolites which, after identification and isolation, can be used to discover the value of immunometabolism. During this study, to mimic the metabolic processes of influenza virus infection in human cells, we infect A549 cells with H1N1 (WSN) influenza virus and explore the metabolites with altered levels during the first cycle of influenza virus infection using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-TOF MS) technology. We annotate the metabolites using MetaboAnalyst and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which reveal that IAV regulates the abundance of the metabolic products of host cells during early infection to provide the energy and metabolites required to efficiently complete its own life cycle. These metabolites are correlated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mainly are involved in purine, lipid, and glutathione metabolisms. Concurrently, the metabolites interact with signal receptors in A549 cells to participate in cellular energy metabolism signaling pathways. Metabonomic analyses have revealed that, in the first cycle, the virus not only hijacks cell metabolism for its own replication, but also affects innate immunity, indicating a need for further study of the complex relationship between IAV and host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: This metabolomic study analyzes host cell metabolic changes during influenza infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The ETS transcription factor ELF1 regulates a broadly antiviral program distinct from the type I interferon response.
Abstract: Induction of vast transcriptional programs is a central event of innate host responses to viral infections. Here we report a transcriptional program with potent antiviral activity, driven by E74-like ETS transcription factor 1 (ELF1). Using microscopy to quantify viral infection over time, we found that ELF1 inhibits eight diverse RNA and DNA viruses after multi-cycle replication. Elf1 deficiency results in enhanced susceptibility to influenza A virus infections in mice. ELF1 does not feed-forward to induce interferons, and ELF1's antiviral effect is not abolished by the absence of STAT1 or by inhibition of JAK phosphorylation. Accordingly, comparative expression analyses by RNA-seq revealed that the ELF1 transcriptional program is distinct from interferon signatures. Thus, ELF1 provides an additional layer of the innate host response, independent from the action of type I interferons.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes a host transcription factor's antiviral program without direct links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Catalytic inactivation of influenza virus by iron oxide nanozyme.
Abstract: Influenza poses a severe threat to human health in the world. However, developing a universal anti-viral strategy has remained challenging due to the presence of diverse subtypes as well as its high mutation rate, resulting in antigenic shift and drift. Here we developed an antiviral strategy using iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes) to target the lipid envelope of the influenza virus. <b>Methods:</b> We evaluated the antiviral activities of our IONzymes using a hemagglutination assay, together with a 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>) method. Lipid peroxidation of the viral envelope was analyzed using a maleic dialdehyde (MDA) assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The neighboring viral proteins were detected by western blotting. <b>Results:</b> We show that IONzymes induce envelope lipid peroxidation and destroy the integrity of neighboring proteins, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein 1, causing the inactivation of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Furthermore, we show that our IONzymes possess a broad-spectrum antiviral activity on 12 subtypes of IAVs (H1~H12). Lastly, we demonstrate that applying IONzymes to a facemask improves the ability of virus protection against 3 important subtypes that pose a threat to human, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype. <b>Conclusion:</b> Together, our results clearly demonstrate that IONzymes can catalyze lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope to inactivate enveloped viruses and provide protection from viral transmission and infection.

Reason: The study focuses on antiviral activity of iron oxide nanozymes targeting the viral envelope, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: The Role of Innate Leukocytes during Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is a serious threat to humans and animals, with the potential to cause severe pneumonia and death. Annual vaccination strategies are a mainstay to prevent complications related to influenza. However, protection from the emerging subtypes of influenza A viruses (IAV) even in vaccinated individuals is challenging. Innate immune cells are the first cells to respond to IAV infection in the respiratory tract. Virus replication-induced production of cytokines from airway epithelium recruits innate immune cells to the site of infection. These leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, natural killer cells, innate lymphoid cells, and <i>γδ</i> T cells, become activated in response to IAV, to contain the virus and protect the airway epithelium while triggering the adaptive arm of the immune system. This review addresses different anti-influenza virus schemes of innate immune cells and how these cells fine-tune the balance between immunoprotection and immunopathology during IAV infection. Detailed understanding on how these innate responders execute anti-influenza activity will help to identify novel therapeutic targets to halt IAV replication and associated immunopathology.

Reason: This is a review of innate immune cell roles during influenza infection, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, May 19-September 28, 2019, and Composition of the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: During May 19-September 28, 2019,* low levels of influenza activity were reported in the United States, with cocirculation of influenza A and influenza B viruses. In the Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza viruses circulated widely, with influenza A(H3) predominating in many regions; however, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were predominant in some countries. In late September, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended components for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and included an update to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. Annual influenza vaccination is the best means for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and vaccination before influenza activity increases is optimal. Health care providers should recommend vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications to vaccination (1).

Title: Asparagine Deprivation Causes a Reversible Inhibition of Human Cytomegalovirus Acute Virus Replication.
Abstract: As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses rely on the host cell machinery to replicate efficiently, with the host metabolism extensively manipulated for this purpose. High-throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens provide a systematic approach for the identification of novel host-virus interactions. Here, we report a large-scale screen for host factors important for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), consisting of 6,881 siRNAs. We identified 47 proviral factors and 68 antiviral factors involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including the mediator complex, proteasome function, and mRNA splicing. Focused characterization of one of the hits, asparagine synthetase (ASNS), demonstrated a strict requirement for asparagine for HCMV replication which leads to an early block in virus replication before the onset of DNA amplification. This effect is specific to HCMV, as knockdown of ASNS had little effect on herpes simplex virus 1 or influenza A virus replication, suggesting that the restriction is not simply due to a failure in protein production. Remarkably, virus replication could be completely rescued 7 days postinfection with the addition of exogenous asparagine, indicating that while virus replication is restricted at an early stage, it maintains the capacity for full replication days after initial infection. This study represents the most comprehensive siRNA screen for the identification of host factors involved in HCMV replication and identifies the nonessential amino acid asparagine as a critical factor in regulating HCMV virus replication. These results have implications for control of viral latency and the clinical treatment of HCMV in patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> HCMV accounts for more than 60% of complications associated with solid organ transplant patients. Prophylactic or preventative treatment with antivirals, such as ganciclovir, reduces the occurrence of early onset HCMV disease. However, late onset disease remains a significant problem, and prolonged treatment, especially in patients with suppressed immune systems, greatly increases the risk of antiviral resistance. Very few antivirals have been developed for use against HCMV since the licensing of ganciclovir, and of these, the same viral genes are often targeted, reducing the usefulness of these drugs against resistant strains. An alternative approach is to target host genes essential for virus replication. Here we demonstrate that HCMV replication is highly dependent on levels of the amino acid asparagine and that knockdown of a critical enzyme involved in asparagine synthesis results in severe attenuation of virus replication. These results suggest that reducing asparagine levels through dietary restriction or chemotherapeutic treatment could limit HCMV replication in patients.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host factors affecting HCMV replication and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inferring host roles in bayesian phylodynamics of global avian influenza A virus H9N2.
Abstract: Role of avian hosts in shaping persistence, evolution, and dispersal of global low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 remains uncertain. Under Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework, we used the discrete trait analysis (DTA) to reconstruct host and location switches in the evolutionary history of global H9N2 given hemagglutinin gene sequences from 18 countries/regions between 1976 and 2018. We employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to inform virus migration rates by empirical predictors. Global H9N2 isolates were mostly sampled from domestic Phasianidae in low- and middle-income countries with poor bio-security. Anatidae was inferred as the ancestral source from which the virus spread to domestic waterfowl, and later to domestic Phasianidae who have become the dominant host to sustain the virus, especially in Asia. Poultry trade was a well-supported driver to H9N2 spread across countries/regions. Strict bio-security and separation between wild and domestic poultry can be used to mitigate virus spread.

Reason: This is a phylogenetic and epidemiological study focusing on host roles and virus spread, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Role of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activation in H5N1 influenza A virus-induced c-Jun terminal kinase activation and virus replication.
Abstract: Activation of c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) by the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus (IAV) plays an important role in inducing autophagy and virus replication. However, the mechanisms of NS1-induced JNK activation remain elusive. Here we first confirmed the ability of H5N1 (A/mallard/Huadong/S/2005) to activate JNK and to induce autophagy in 293T cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line. We further showed that TAK1, MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), and JNK were activated in 293T cells transfected with the NS1 gene of the H5N1 virus. JNK activation by the NS1 protein or by H5N1 virus was blocked by 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol (5Z), a TAK1-specific inhibitor, and by TAK1 siRNA. Further study showed that 5Z and TAK1 siRNA suppressed H5N1 virus-induced autophagy and inhibited virus replication. Our study unveiled a previously unrecognized role of TAK1 in IAV replication, IAV-induced JNK activation, and autophagy.

Title: Exploration of the mechanisms of Ge Gen Decoction against influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Ge Gen Decoction (GGD), a Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription, is mainly used to treat infectious respiratory diseases and can relieve the symptoms of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, the underlying mechanism of GGD against IAV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that GGD had moderate anti-IAV activity in vitro. GGD was more effective when given before the viral infection and targeted the viral attachment and replication stages rather than the internalization stage. In vivo, GGD treatment reduced thevirus titers of lung tissue significantly and improved the survival rate, lung index, and pulmonary histopathological changes in H1N1-infected mice. We observed the changes in several key immuno-related indexes in GGD administrated H1N1-infected mice with anti-IAV drug oseltamivir phosphate as the control. GGD treatment decreased the expression of TNF-α and improved Th1/Th2 immune balance to reduce the excessive immune response in H1N1-infected mice. Besides, the expression of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway in H1N1-infected mice decreased after GGD treatment. Our results showed that GGD has anti-IAV activity and can modulate the immune system to relieve lung inflammation.

Title: Seasonal dynamics of influenza viruses and age distribution of infected individuals across nine seasons covering 2009-2018 in Taiwan.
Abstract: A swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (termed A/H1N1pdm) caused a pandemic in 2009 and has continuously circulated in the human population. To investigate its possible ecological effects on circulating influenza strains, the seasonal patterns of influenza viruses and the respective age distribution of infected patients were studies. The data obtained from national influenza surveillance systems in Taiwan from July 2009 to June 2018 were analyzed. The A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 strains usually caused a higher ratio of severe to mild cases than influenza B. New variants of A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 emerged accompanied by a large epidemic peak. However, the new influenza B variants intended to circulate for several seasons before causing a large epidemic. The major group of outpatients affected by A/H1N1pdm were aged 13-23 years in the pandemic wave, and the age range of infected individuals gradually shifted to 24-49 and 0-6 years across seasons; A/H1N1pdm-infected inpatients were aged 24-49 years in 2009-2011, and the age range gradually switched to older groups aged 50-65 and >65 years. Individuals aged 0-6 or 24-49 years accounted for the majority of A/H3N2-infected outpatients across seasons, whereas most of the inpatients affected by A/H3N2 were aged >65 years. Understanding the effects of new variants and changes in dominant circulating viral strains on the age distribution of the affected human population, disease severity and epidemic levels is useful for the establishment of fine-tuned strategies for further improvement of influenza control.

Title: Circadian control of lung inflammation in influenza infection.
Abstract: Influenza is a leading cause of respiratory mortality and morbidity. While inflammation is essential for fighting infection, a balance of anti-viral defense and host tolerance is necessary for recovery. Circadian rhythms have been shown to modulate inflammation. However, the importance of diurnal variability in the timing of influenza infection is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that endogenous rhythms affect survival in influenza infection. Circadian control of influenza infection is mediated by enhanced inflammation as proven by increased cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary transcriptomic profile and histology and is not attributable to viral burden. Better survival is associated with a time dependent preponderance of NK and NKT cells and lower proportion of inflammatory monocytes in the lung. Further, using a series of genetic mouse mutants, we elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying circadian gating of influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates circadian control of lung inflammation during influenza infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus infection induces liver injury in mice.
Abstract: Respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV in humans are often accompanied by mild and self-limiting hepatitis. As a respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to hepatitis, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hepatitis by establishing a model for infected mice for three different subtypes of respiratory IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N2). Histological analysis was performed, and results showed increase serum aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels and evident liver injury on days 3 and 7, especially on day 5 post infection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicated a wide distribution of IAV's positive signals in the liver of infected mice. Real-time PCR results further revealed a similar viral titer to IHC that presented a remarkedly positive correlation with histology injury. All these data showed that the mouse model suitably contributed valuable information about the mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatitis induced by respiratory influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates liver injury induced by influenza A virus infection in mice but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Parallel Phenotypic Versus Target-Based Screening Strategy for RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors of the Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, and novel antivirals are urgently needed. Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity has been acknowledged as a promising target for novel antivirals. In this study, a phenotypic versus target-based screening strategy was established to identify the influenza A virus inhibitors targeting the virus RNA transcription/replication steps by sequentially using an RdRp-targeted screen and a replication-competent reporter virus-based approach using the same compounds. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a pilot screen of a library of 891 compounds derived from natural products was carried out. Quality control analysis indicates that the primary screen was robust for identification of influenza A virus inhibitors targeting RdRp activity. Finally, two hit candidates were identified, and one was validated as a putative RdRp inhibitor. This strategy can greatly reduce the number of false positives and improve the accuracy and efficacy of primary screening, thereby providing a powerful tool for antiviral discovery.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a screening strategy for influenza A virus polymerase inhibitors without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Long-term culture of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells enhances the replication of human influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Long-term culture of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 promotes the differentiation of these cells toward an alveolar type II cell phenotype. Here, we evaluated the susceptibility of long-term cultured A549 cells to human influenza viruses. A549 cells were cultured continuously for 25 days (D25-A549) or 1 day (D1-A549) in Ham's F12K medium. Six human influenza A viruses grew much faster in D25-A549 cells than in D1-A549 cells; however, two influenza B viruses replicated poorly in both cell types. Two avian influenza viruses replicated efficiently in both cell types, with similar titres. Expression levels of human virus receptors were higher in D25-A549 cells than in D1-A549 cells. D25-A549 cells thus more efficiently support the replication of human influenza A viruses compared with D1-A549 cells. Our data suggest that long-term cultured A549 cells will be useful for influenza A virus research.

Title: Improving risk assessment of the emergence of novel influenza A viruses by incorporating environmental surveillance.
Abstract: Reassortment is an evolutionary mechanism by which influenza A viruses (IAV) generate genetic novelty. Reassortment is an important driver of host jumps and is widespread according to retrospective surveillance studies. However, predicting the epidemiological risk of reassortant emergence in novel hosts from surveillance data remains challenging. IAV strains persist and co-occur in the environment, promoting co-infection during environmental transmission. These conditions offer opportunity to understand reassortant emergence in reservoir and spillover hosts. Specifically, environmental RNA could provide rich information for understanding the evolutionary ecology of segmented viruses, and transform our ability to quantify epidemiological risk to spillover hosts. However, significant challenges with recovering and interpreting genomic RNA from the environment have impeded progress towards predicting reassortant emergence from environmental surveillance data. We discuss how the fields of genomics, experimental ecology and epidemiological modelling are well positioned to address these challenges. Coupling quantitative disease models and natural transmission studies with new molecular technologies, such as deep-mutational scanning and single-virus sequencing of environmental samples, should dramatically improve our understanding of viral co-occurrence and reassortment. We define observable risk metrics for emerging molecular technologies and propose a conceptual research framework for improving accuracy and efficiency of risk prediction. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

Reason: Focuses on environmental surveillance and modeling of reassortment risk without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Madin-Darby canine kidney cell sialic acid receptor modulation induced by culture medium conditions: Implications for the isolation of influenza A virus.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) binds to α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors expressed by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The receptor distribution may therefore be important in regulating IAV propagation. Serum-free medium (SFM) avoids variability in conventional culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), which can have variable composition and may contain endotoxins. However, little is known about the distribution of SA receptors on cells maintained in SFM. We assessed the influence of culture media on MDCK cell SA receptor distribution along with the effect of SA receptor distribution on IAV recovery. We hypothesized that SFM would increase the proportion of α-2,6-linked SA receptors present and alter isolate recovery. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were cultured in medium containing FBS and two SFMs. Cell surface distribution of α-2,6- and α-2,3-linked receptors was determined using flow cytometry. Recovery of swine- and avian-lineage IAVs from MDCK cells maintained in each medium was quantified as TCID<sub>50</sub> . Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured in UltraMDCK SFM expressed both SA receptors and supported the growth of both swine- and avian-lineage IAVs. Cells maintained in other medium inconsistently expressed each receptor and the avian IAV grew to lower titers in cells cultured with FBS. Medium conditions altered the distribution of SA receptors present on MDCK cells and affected IAV recovery. Culture in UltraMDCK SFM resulted in cells expressing both receptors and IAVs grew to higher titers than in the other culture condition, indicating that this medium may be useful for culturing IAV from multiple species.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on how culture medium affects host cell receptor distribution and virus recovery, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: DNA mismatch repair is required for the host innate response and controls cellular fate after influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Despite the cytopathic nature of influenza A virus (IAV) replication, we recently reported that a subset of lung epithelial club cells is able to intrinsically clear the virus and survive infection. However, the mechanisms that drive cell survival during a normally lytic infection remained unclear. Using a loss-of-function screening approach, we discovered that the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is essential for club cell survival of IAV infection. Repair of virally induced oxidative damage by the DNA MMR pathway not only allowed cell survival of infection, but also facilitated host gene transcription, including the expression of antiviral and stress response genes. Enhanced viral suppression of the DNA MMR pathway prevented club cell survival and increased the severity of viral disease in vivo. Altogether, these results identify previously unappreciated roles for DNA MMR as a central modulator of cellular fate and a contributor to the innate antiviral response, which together control influenza viral disease severity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host DNA mismatch repair pathways affecting host cell survival and innate response to influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The Interferon-Inducible Proteoglycan Testican-2/SPOCK2 Functions as a Protective Barrier against Virus Infection of Lung Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: Proteoglycans function not only as structural components of the extracellular compartment but also as regulators of various cellular events, including cell migration, inflammation, and infection. Many microbial pathogens utilize proteoglycans to facilitate adhesion and invasion into host cells. Here we report a secreted form of a novel heparan sulfate proteoglycan that functions against virus infection. The expression of SPOCK2/testican-2 was significantly induced in virus-infected lungs or in interferon (IFN)-treated alveolar lung epithelial cells. Overexpression from a SPOCK2 expression plasmid alone or the treatment of cells with recombinant SPOCK2 protein efficiently blocked influenza virus infection at the step of viral attachment to the host cell and entry. Moreover, mice treated with purified SPOCK2 were protected against virus infection. Sialylated glycans and heparan sulfate chains covalently attached to the SPOCK2 core protein were critical for its antiviral activity. Neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus cleaves the sialylated moiety of SPOCK2, thereby blocking its binding to the virus. Our data suggest that IFN-induced SPOCK2 functions as a decoy receptor to bind and block influenza virus infection, thereby restricting entry of the infecting virus into neighboring cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Here we report a novel proteoglycan protein, testican-2/SPOCK2, that prevents influenza virus infection. Testican-2/SPOCK2 is a complex type of secreted proteoglycan with heparan sulfate GAG chains attached to the core protein. SPOCK2 expression is induced upon virus infection or by interferons, and the protein is secreted to an extracellular compartment, where it acts directly to block virus-cell attachment and entry. Treatment with purified testican-2/SPOCK2 protein can efficiently block influenza virus infection <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> We also identified the heparan sulfate moiety as a key regulatory module for this inhibitory effect. Based on its mode of action (cell attachment/entry blocker) and site of action (extracellular compartment), we propose testican-2/SPOCK2 as a potential antiviral agent that can efficiently control influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study describes a host proteoglycan (SPOCK2) that inhibits viral infection, focusing on host factors and antiviral mechanisms rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Protease-activated receptor 4 protects mice from Coxsackievirus B3 and H1N1 influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: PAR4 is expressed by a variety of cells, including platelets, cardiac, lung and immune cells. We investigated the contribution of PAR4 to viral infections of the heart and lung. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3-dependent immune responses were analyzed after co-stimulation of PAR4 in murine bone-marrow derived macrophages, embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or H1N1 influenza A virus (H1N1 IAV) infection of PAR4<sup>-/-</sup> (ΔPAR4) and wild-type (WT) mice. Lastly, we investigated the effect of platelet inhibition on H1N1 IAV infection. In vitro experiments revealed that PAR4 stimulation enhances the expression of TLR3-dependent CXCL10 expression and decreases TLR3-dependent NFκB-mediated proinflammatory gene expression. Furthermore, CVB3-infected ΔPAR4 mice exhibited a decreased anti-viral response and increased viral genomes in the heart leading to more pronounced CVB3 myocarditis compared to WT mice. Similarly, H1N1 IAV-infected ΔPAR4 mice had increased immune cell numbers and inflammatory mediators in the lung, and increased mortality compared with infected WT controls. The study showed that PAR4 protects mice from viral infections of the heart and lung.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of host protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) in protection against viral infection, focusing on host immune responses rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of EdAP, a 4'-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-Monophosphate Analog, as a Potent Influenza a Inhibitor.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses leading to infectious respiratory diseases cause seasonal epidemics and sometimes periodic global pandemics. Viral polymerase is an attractive target in inhibiting viral replication, and 4'-ethynyladenosine, which has been reported as a highly potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleoside derivative, can work as an anti-influenza agent. Herein, we designed and synthesized a 4'-ethynyl-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate analog called EdAP (<b>5</b>). EdAP exhibited potent inhibition against influenza virus multiplication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transfected with human α2-6-sialyltransferase (SIAT1) cDNA and did not show any toxicity toward the cells. Surprisingly, this DNA-type nucleic acid analog (<b>5</b>) inhibited the multiplication of influenza A virus, although influenza virus is an RNA virus that does not generate DNA.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes the design and biological evaluation of a nucleoside analog inhibitor of influenza virus, focusing on antiviral activity rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Recalling the Future: Immunological Memory Toward Unpredictable Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Persistent and durable immunological memory forms the basis of any successful vaccination protocol. Generation of pre-existing memory B cell and T cell pools is thus the key for maintaining protective immunity to seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza viruses. Long-lived antibody secreting cells (ASCs) are responsible for maintaining antibody levels in peripheral blood. Generated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T help after naïve B cell precursors encounter their cognate antigen, the linked processes of differentiation (including Ig class switching) and proliferation also give rise to memory B cells, which then can change rapidly to ASC status after subsequent influenza encounters. Given that influenza viruses evolve rapidly as a consequence of antibody-driven mutational change (antigenic drift), the current influenza vaccines need to be reformulated frequently and annual vaccination is recommended. Without that process of regular renewal, they provide little protection against "drifted" (particularly H3N2) variants and are mainly ineffective when a novel pandemic (2009 A/H1N1 "swine" flu) strain suddenly emerges. Such limitation of antibody-mediated protection might be circumvented, at least in part, by adding a novel vaccine component that promotes cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for conserved viral peptides, presented by widely distributed HLA types. Such "memory" cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can rapidly be recalled to CTL effector status. Here, we review how B cells and follicular T cells are elicited following influenza vaccination and how they survive into a long-term memory. We describe how CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL memory is established following influenza virus infection, and how a robust CTL recall response can lead to more rapid virus elimination by destroying virus-infected cells, and recovery. Exploiting long-term, cross-reactive CTL against the continuously evolving and unpredictable influenza viruses provides a possible mechanism for preventing a disastrous pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 H1N1 "Spanish flu," which killed more than 50 million people worldwide.

Title: Upregulation of cell-surface mucin MUC15 in human nasal epithelial cells upon influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Cell-surface mucins are expressed in apical epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, and contribute a crucial part of the innate immune system. Despite anti-inflammatory or antiviral functions being revealed for certain cell-surface mucins such as MUC1, the roles of other mucins are still poorly understood, especially in viral infections. To further identify mucins significant in influenza infection, we screened the expression of mucins in human nasal epithelial cells infected by H3N2 influenza A virus. We found that the expression of MUC15 was significantly upregulated upon infection, and specific only to active infection. While MUC15 did not interact with virus particles or reduce viral replication directly, positive correlations were observed between MUC15 and inflammatory factors in response to viral infection. Given that the upregulation of MUC15 was only triggered late into infection when immune factors (including cytokines, chemokines, EGFR and phosphorylated ERK) started to peak and plateau, MUC15 may potentially serve an immunomodulatory function later during influenza viral infection. Our study revealed that MUC15 was one of the few cell-surface mucins induced during influenza infection. While MUC15 did not interact directly with influenza virus, we showed that its increase coincides with the peak of immune activation and thus MUC15 may serve an immunomodulatory role during influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the upregulation of MUC15 in response to influenza infection and its immunomodulatory role, but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Viral interference between H9N2-low pathogenic avian influenza virus and avian infectious bronchitis virus vaccine strain H120 in vivo.
Abstract: The interaction between a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/CK/TUN/145/2012), a H9N2 Tunisian isolate, and a vaccine strain (H120) of avian infectious bronchitis, administered simultaneously or sequentially three days apart to chicks during 20 days, was evaluated using ELISA antibody levels, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses and histopathology examination. First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chick's infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV + IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection. In conclusion, co-infection of chicks with AIV and IBV, simultaneously or sequentially, affected the clinical signs, the virus replication dynamics as well as the internal organ integrity. The results proposed that infection with heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated.

Title: Serial Section Array Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis of Cells from Lung Autopsy Specimens following Fatal A/H1N1 2009 Pandemic Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) was first identified as a novel pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) in 2009. Previously, we reported that many viral antigens were detected in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-IIs) within autopsied lung tissue from a patient with A/H1N1/pdm09 pneumonia. It is important to identify the association between the virus and host cells to elucidate the pathogenesis of IAV pneumonia. To investigate the distribution of virus particles and morphological changes in host cells, the autopsied lung specimens from this patient were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a novel scanning electron microscopy (SEM) method. We focused on AEC-IIs as viral antigen-positive cells and on monocytes/macrophages (Ms/Mϕs) and neutrophils (Neus) as innate immune cells. We identified virus particles and intranuclear dense tubules, which are associated with matrix 1 (M1) proteins from IAV. Large-scale two-dimensional observation was enabled by digitally "stitching" together contiguous SEM images. A single whole-cell analysis using a serial section array (SSA)-SEM identified virus particles in vesicles within the cytoplasm and/or around the surfaces of AEC-IIs, Ms/Mϕs, and Neus; however, intranuclear dense tubules were found only in AEC-IIs. Computer-assisted processing of SSA-SEM images from each cell type enabled three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the distribution of virus particles within an ACE-II, a M/Mϕ, and a Neu.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Generally, it is difficult to observe IAV particles in postmortem samples from patients with seasonal influenza. In fact, only a few viral antigens are detected in bronchial epithelial cells from autopsied lung sections. Previously, we detected many viral antigens in AEC-IIs from the lung. This was because the majority of A/H1N1/pdm09 in the lung tissue harbored an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at position 222 (D222G) of the hemagglutinin protein. A/H1N1/pdm09 harboring the D222G substitution has a receptor-binding preference for α-2,3-linked sialic acids expressed on human AECs and infects them in the same way as H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAVs. Here, we report the first successful observation of virus particles, not only in AEC-IIs, but also in Ms/Mϕs and Neus, using electron microscopy. The finding of a M/Mϕ harboring numerous virus particles within vesicles and at the cell surface suggests that Ms/Mϕs are involved in the pathogenesis of IAV primary pneumonia.

Title: Investigation of an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in an indigenous village in Brazil: Contribution of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and human respiratory syncytial viruses.
Abstract: Analyses of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and post-pandemic years showed high attack rates and severity among indigenous populations. This study presents the characteristics of the first documented influenza outbreak in indigenous peoples in Brazil, that occurred from 30th March to 14th April 2016 in a Guarani village in Southeast Region. Acute respiratory infections were prospectively investigated. The majority of the 73 cases were influenza-like illness (ILI) (63.0%) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (20.5%). The ILI+SARI attack rate (35.9%) decreased with increasing age. There was a high influenza vaccination rate (86.3%), but no statistically significant difference in vaccination rates between severe and non-severe cases was seen (p = 0.334). Molecular analyses of 19.2% of the cases showed 100% positivity for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and/or hRSV. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was included in the 6B.1 genetic group, a distinct cluster with 13 amino acid substitutions of A/California/07/2009-like. The hRSV were clustered in the BA-like genetic group. The early arrival of the influenza season overlapping usual hRSV season, the circulation of a drifted influenza virus not covered by vaccine and the high prevalence of risk factors for infection and severity in the village jointly can explain the high attack rate of ARI, even with a high rate of influenza vaccination. The results reinforce the importance of surveillance of respiratory viruses, timely vaccination and controlling risk factors for infection and severity of in the indigenous populations in order to preventing disease and related deaths, particularly in children.

Title: Analytical evaluation of the microarray-based FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay.
Abstract: Influenza causes a significant annual disease burden, with characterization of the infecting virus important in clinical and public health settings. Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including non-seasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay. Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A+B Assay ranged from 5.8 × 10<sup>2</sup>-1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> genome copies/mL, with most samples ∼2 × 10<sup>3</sup> genome copies/mL (∼160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both "non-seasonal influenza A" and A/H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0% (95% CI 94.7-98.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation.

Title: Microbial Composition of the Human Nasopharynx Varies According to Influenza Virus Type and Vaccination Status.
Abstract: Factors that contribute to enhanced susceptibility to severe bacterial disease after influenza virus infection are not well defined but likely include the microbiome of the respiratory tract. Vaccination against influenza, while having variable effectiveness, could also play a role in microbial community stability. We collected nasopharyngeal samples from 215 individuals infected with influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B virus and profiled the microbiota by target sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified signature taxonomic groups by performing linear discriminant analysis and effective size comparisons (LEfSe) and defined bacterial community types using Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. Influenza infection was shown to be significantly associated with microbial composition of the nasopharynx according to the virus type and the vaccination status of the patient. We identified four microbial community types across the combined cohort of influenza patients and healthy individuals with one community type most representative of the influenza virus-infected group. We also identified microbial taxa for which relative abundance was significantly higher in the unvaccinated elderly group; these taxa include species known to be associated with pneumonia.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Our results suggest that there is a significant association between the composition of the microbiota in the nasopharynx and the influenza virus type causing the infection. We observe that vaccination status, especially in more senior individuals, also has an association with the microbial community profile. This indicates that vaccination against influenza, even when ineffective to prevent disease, could play a role in controlling secondary bacterial complications.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes nasopharyngeal microbiota variation with influenza virus type and vaccination status but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus production in a single-use orbital shaken bioreactor with ATF or TFF perfusion systems.
Abstract: Driven by the concept of plug-and-play cell culture-based viral vaccine production using disposable bioreactors, we evaluated an orbital shaken bioreactor (OSB) for human influenza A virus production at high cell concentration. Therefore, the OSB model SB10-X was coupled to two hollow fiber-based perfusion systems, namely, tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF). The AGE1.CR.pIX avian suspension cells grew to 50 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in chemically defined medium, maintaining high cell viabilities with an average specific growth rate of 0.020 h<sup>-1</sup> (doubling time = 32 h). Maximum virus titers in the range of 3.28-3.73 log<sub>10</sub>(HA units/100 µL) were achieved, corresponding to cell-specific virus yields of 1000-3500 virions/cell and productivities of 0.5-2.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> virions/L/d. This clearly demonstrates the potential of OSB operation in perfusion mode, as results achieved in a reference OSB batch cultivation were 2.64 log<sub>10</sub>(HA units/100 µL), 1286 virions/cell and 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> virions/L/d, respectively. In summary, the SB10-X bioreactor can be operated with ATF and TFF systems, which is to our knowledge the first report regarding OSB operation in perfusion mode. Moreover, the results showed that the system is a promising cultivation system for influenza A virus vaccine production. The OSB disposable bioreactor has the potential for simplifying the scale-up from shake flasks to the large-scale bioreactor, facilitating rapid responses in the event of epidemics or pandemics.

Title: Circulation and characterization of seasonal influenza viruses in Cambodia, 2012-2015.
Abstract: Influenza virus circulation is monitored through the Cambodian influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance system and isolates are characterized by the National Influenza Centre (NIC). Seasonal influenza circulation has previously been characterized by year-round activity and a peak during the rainy season (June-November). We documented the circulation of seasonal influenza in Cambodia for 2012-2015 and investigated genetic, antigenic, and antiviral resistance characteristics of influenza isolates. Respiratory samples were collected from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) at 11 hospitals throughout Cambodia. First-line screening was conducted by the National Institute of Public Health and the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences. Confirmation of testing and genetic, antigenic and antiviral resistance characterization was conducted by Institute Pasteur in Cambodia, the NIC. Additional virus characterization was conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (Melbourne, Australia). Between 2012 and 2015, 1,238 influenza-positive samples were submitted to the NIC. Influenza A(H3N2) (55.3%) was the dominant subtype, followed by influenza B (30.9%; predominantly B/Yamagata-lineage) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (13.9%). Circulation of influenza viruses began earlier in 2014 and 2015 than previously described, coincident with the emergence of A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a, respectively. There was high diversity in the antigenicity of A(H3N2) viruses, and to a smaller extent influenza B viruses, during this period, with some mismatches with the northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations. All isolates tested were susceptible to the influenza antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Seasonal and year-round co-circulation of multiple influenza types/subtypes were detected in Cambodia during 2012-2015.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes circulation and characterization of seasonal influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antivirals targeting the polymerase complex of influenza viruses.
Abstract: Current influenza antivirals have limitations with regard to their effectiveness and the potential emergence of resistance. Encouragingly, several new compounds which inhibit the polymerase of influenza viruses have recently been shown to have enhanced pre-clinical and clinical effectiveness compared to the neuraminidase inhibitors, the mainstay of influenza antiviral therapy over the last two decades. In this review we focus on four compounds which inhibit polymerase function, baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, pimodivir and AL-794 and discuss their clinical and virological effectiveness, their propensity to select for resistance and their potential for future combination therapy with the most commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir.

Title: Phylogeographic evidence for the inter- and intracontinental dissemination of avian influenza viruses via migration flyways.
Abstract: Genetically related highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of H5N6 subtype caused outbreaks simultaneously in East Asia and Europe-geographically distinct regions-during winter 2017-2018. This situation prompted us to consider whether the application of phylogeographic analysis to a particular gene segment of AIVs could provide clues for understanding how AIV had been disseminated across the continent. Here, the N6 NA genes of influenza viruses isolated across the world were subjected to phylogeographic analysis to illustrate the inter- and intracontinental dissemination of AIVs. Those isolated in East Asia during winter and in Mongolia/Siberia during summer were comingled within particular clades of the phylogeographic tree. For AIVs in one clade, their dissemination in eastern Eurasia extended from Yakutia, Russia, in the north to East Asia in the south. AIVs in western Asia, Europe, and Mongolia were also comingled within other clades, indicating that Mongolia/Siberia plays an important role in the dissemination of AIVs across the Eurasian continent. Mongolia/Siberia may therefore have played a role in the simultaneous outbreaks of H5N6 HPAIVs in Europe and East Asia during the winter of 2017-2018. In addition to the long-distance intracontinental disseminations described above, intercontinental disseminations of AIVs between Eurasia and Africa and between Eurasia and North America were also observed. Integrating these results and known migration flyways suggested that the migration of wild birds and the overlap of flyways, such as that observed in Mongolia/Siberia and along the Alaskan Peninsula, contributed to the long-distance intra- and intercontinental dissemination of AIVs. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the movement of migratory birds and the dynamics of AIVs in breeding areas-especially where several migration flyways overlap-in forecasting outbreaks caused by HPAIVs.

Reason: The paper focuses on phylogeographic analysis of avian influenza virus dissemination via migration flyways, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: [Inhibition of the replication of H9N2 influenza virus in vivo by short-term repeated oral administration of chicken interferon α].
Abstract: To evaluate the optimal administration frequency for interferon-α (IFN-α) and the effect of its combined use with inactive virus on chicken flocks, the prokaryotic expression plasmid pET-22b-ChIFN-α was constructed and transferred into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host bacteria to induce the expression of chicken IFN-α and to harvest recombinant proteins inclusion bodies. The expression of recombinant chicken IFN-α was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the results demonstrated that the chicken IFN-α (20 kDa) was highly expressed using the prokaryotic expression vector with a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in the medium. Chicken IFN-α was diluted to 2.5×10⁴ U/fowls and administered to immunized specific-pathogen-free chickens orally in combination with inactivated H9N2 subtype influenza virus. Chicken that received chicken IFN-α were safe after three repeated immunizations (96 h). In addition, chicken IFN-α could induce higher levels of antiviral-related inducible genes in peripheral blood, spleen, and thymus of chicken flocks. The results of a challenge assay revealed that the lowest detoxification rates of chicken IFN-α ranged from three to five days, suggesting a higher capacity to resist H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus. The present study obtained the optimal immune frequency and immunization period for chicken IFN-α to provide theoretical support for the optimal clinical application of IFN-α.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity in the United States During the 2018-19 Season and Composition of the 2019-20 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: Influenza activity* in the United States during the 2018-19 season (September 30, 2018-May 18, 2019) was of moderate severity (1). Nationally, influenza-like illness (ILI)<sup>†</sup> activity began increasing in November, peaked during mid-February, and returned to below baseline in mid-April; the season lasted 21 weeks,<sup>§</sup> making it the longest season in 10 years. Illness attributed to influenza A viruses predominated, with very little influenza B activity. Two waves of influenza A were notable during this extended season: influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from October 2018 to mid-February 2019 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses from February through May 2019. Compared with the 2017-18 influenza season, rates of hospitalization this season were lower for adults, but were similar for children. Although influenza activity is currently below surveillance baselines, testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should continue year-round. Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in 2017.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a record total of 5866 human influenza positive samples during 2017. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties and were propagated in qualified cells and hens’ eggs for use as potential seasonal influenza vaccine virus candidates. In 2017, influenza A(H3) viruses predominated over influenza A(H1)pdm09 and B viruses, accounting for a total of 54% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2017. However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the majority of circulating A(H3) viruses had undergone genetic drift relative to the WHO recommended vaccine strain for 2017. Of 3733 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, only two A(H1)pdm09 viruses and one A(H3) virus showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, while just one A(H1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition by zanamivir.

Title: A Tale of Two Mutations: Beginning to Understand the Problems with Egg-Based Influenza Vaccines?
Abstract: The majority of influenza vaccines are produced in embryonated eggs, but mutations occur as human influenza A(H3N2) viruses adapt to grow in eggs. This can alter virus antigenicity. Wu et al. (2019) reveal that there are two mutually exclusive pathways for egg adaptation, which has potential implications for future egg-based influenza vaccines.

Title: A dual controllability analysis of influenza virus-host protein-protein interaction networks for antiviral drug target discovery.
Abstract: Host factors of influenza virus replication are often found in key topological positions within protein-protein interaction networks. This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cell's progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host protein-protein interaction networks and controllability analyses to identify host factors for antiviral targets, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Structure and Function of the Influenza A Virus Non-Structural Protein 1.
Abstract: The influenza A virus is a highly infectious respiratory pathogen that sickens many people with respiratory disease annually. To prevent outbreaks of this viral infection, an understanding of the characteristics of virus-host interaction and development of an anti-viral agent is urgently needed. The influenza A virus can infect mammalian species including humans, pigs, horses and seals. Furthermore, this virus can switch hosts and form a novel lineage. This so-called zoonotic infection provides an opportunity for virus adaptation to the new host and leads to pandemics. Most influenza A viruses express proteins that antagonize the antiviral defense of the host cell. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus is the most important viral regulatory factor controlling cellular processes to modulate host cell gene expression and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated antiviral response. This review focuses on the influenza A virus NS1 protein and outlines current issues including the life cycle of the influenza A virus, structural characterization of the influenza A virus NS1, interaction between NS1 and host immune response factor, and design of inhibitors resistant to the influenza A virus.
Relevant: False

Title: Baloxavir marboxil, a novel cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor potently suppresses influenza virus replication and represents therapeutic effects in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models.
Abstract: Baloxavir marboxil (BXM) is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an essential enzyme in the initiation of mRNA synthesis of influenza viruses. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of BXM against influenza virus infection in mouse models. Single-day oral administration of BXM completely prevented mortality due to infection with influenza A and B virus in mice. Moreover, 5-day repeated administration of BXM was more effective for reducing mortality and body weight loss in mice infected with influenza A virus than oseltamivir phosphate (OSP), even when the treatment was delayed up to 96 hours post infection (p.i.). Notably, administration of BXM, starting at 72 hours p.i. led to significant decrease in virus titers of >2-log10 reduction compared to the vehicle control within 24 hours after administration. Virus reduction in the lung was significantly greater than that observed with OSP. In addition, profound and sustained reduction of virus titer was observed in the immunocompromised mouse model without emergence of variants possessing treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the target protein. In our immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, delayed treatment with BXM resulted in rapid and potent reduction in infectious virus titer and prevention of signs of influenza infection, suggesting that BXM could extend the therapeutic window for patients with influenza virus infection regardless of the host immune status.

Title: SMRT sequencing revealed the diversity and characteristics of defective interfering RNAs in influenza A (H7N9) virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza defective interfering (DI) particles are replication-incompetent viruses carrying large internal deletion in the genome. The loss of essential genetic information causes abortive viral replication, which can be rescued by co-infection with a helper virus that possesses an intact genome. Despite reports of DI particles present in seasonal influenza A H1N1 infections, their existence in human infections by the avian influenza A viruses, such as H7N9, has not been studied. Here we report the ubiquitous presence of DI-RNAs in nasopharyngeal aspirates of H7N9-infected patients. Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing was first applied and long-read sequencing analysis showed that a variety of H7N9 DI-RNA species were present in the patient samples and human bronchial epithelial cells. In several abundantly expressed DI-RNA species, long overlapping sequences have been identified around at the breakpoint region and the other side of deleted region. Influenza DI-RNA is known as a defective viral RNA with single large internal deletion. Beneficial to the long-read property of SMRT sequencing, double and triple internal deletions were identified in half of the DI-RNA species. In addition, we examined the expression of DI-RNAs in mice infected with sublethal dose of H7N9 virus at different time points. Interestingly, DI-RNAs were abundantly expressed as early as day 2 post-infection. Taken together, we reveal the diversity and characteristics of DI-RNAs found in H7N9-infected patients, cells and animals. Further investigations on this overwhelming generation of DI-RNA may provide important insights into the understanding of H7N9 viral replication and pathogenesis.

Title: Toll-like receptor 5 agonist flagellin reduces influenza A virus replication independently of type I interferon and interleukin 22 and improves antiviral efficacy of oseltamivir.
Abstract: Influenza infections remain a burden on health care systems despite vaccination programs and marketed antiviral drugs. Immunomodulation through activation of innate sensors could represent innovative approaches to fight the flu. This study evaluated the ability of flagellin, agonist of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), to control the replication of influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. First, we showed that systemic or intranasal administration of flagellin activated transcription of anti-viral genes in lung tissue. Prophylactic and therapeutic flagellin administration resulted in decreased levels of viral RNA and infectious virus in the lungs of H3N2 IAV-infected mice. The effect of the flagellin on viral replication was also observed in Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup> and Il22<sup>-/-</sup> IAV-infected mice, suggesting a mechanism independent of type I interferon and interleukin 22 signaling. In addition, a combination therapy associating the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir and flagellin was more effective than standalone treatments in reducing pulmonary viral replication. Thus, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of the flagellin to control the replication of the influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates the effect of a TLR5 agonist on influenza virus replication and immune response but does not analyze viral genotypes or mutations linked to phenotypes.

Title: Combination Therapy Targeting Platelet Activation and Virus Replication Protects Mice against Lethal Influenza Pneumonia.
Abstract: Excessive neutrophils recruited during influenza pneumonia contribute to severe lung pathology through induction of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and release of extracellular histones. We have recently shown that activation of platelets during influenza enhances pulmonary microvascular thrombosis, leading to vascular injury and hemorrhage. Emerging evidence indicates that activated platelets also interact with neutrophils, forming neutrophil-platelet aggregates (NPAs) that contribute to tissue injury. Here, we examined neutrophil-platelet interactions and evaluated the formation of NPAs during influenza pneumonia. We also evaluated the efficacy of clopidogrel (CLP), an antagonist of the ADP-P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> platelet receptor, alone or in combination with an antiviral agent (oseltamivir) against influenza infection in mice. Our studies demonstrated increased platelet activation and induction of NPAs in influenza-infected lungs, and that these NPAs led to NET release both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, neutrophil integrin Mac-1 (macrophage-1 antigen)-mediated platelet binding was critical for NPA formation and NET release. Administration of CLP reduced platelet activation and NPA formation but did not protect the mice against lethal influenza challenge. However, administration of CLP together with oseltamivir improved survival rates in mice compared with oseltamivir alone. The combination treatment reduced lung pathology, neutrophil influx, NPAs, NET release, and inflammatory cytokine release in infected lungs. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that NPAs formed during influenza contribute to acute lung injury. Targeting both platelet activation and virus replication could represent an effective therapeutic option for severe influenza pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune responses and therapeutic effects of platelet activation inhibitors combined with antivirals, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus in humans: a systemic literature review.
Abstract: H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) caused human infections in 2013 in China. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that H7N9 AIV is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential. We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development. We summarized virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and current diagnostic assays in H7N9 AIVs.

Title: Comparative micro-epidemiology of pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreaks in a wild bird population.
Abstract: Understanding the epidemiological dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in wild birds is crucial for guiding effective surveillance and control measures. The spread of H5 HPAIV has been well characterized over large geographical and temporal scales. However, information about the detailed dynamics and demographics of individual outbreaks in wild birds is rare and important epidemiological parameters remain unknown. We present data from a wild population of long-lived birds (mute swans; Cygnus olor) that has experienced three outbreaks of related H5 HPAIVs in the past decade, specifically, H5N1 (2007), H5N8 (2016) and H5N6 (2017). Detailed demographic data were available and intense sampling was conducted before and after the outbreaks; hence the population is unusually suitable for exploring the natural epidemiology, evolution and ecology of HPAIV in wild birds. We show that key epidemiological features remain remarkably consistent across multiple outbreaks, including the timing of virus incursion and outbreak duration, and the presence of a strong age-structure in morbidity that likely arises from an equivalent age-structure in immunological responses. The predictability of these features across a series of outbreaks in a complex natural population is striking and contributes to our understanding of HPAIV in wild birds. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.

Title: A brief history of bird flu.
Abstract: In 1918, a strain of influenza A virus caused a human pandemic resulting in the deaths of 50 million people. A century later, with the advent of sequencing technology and corresponding phylogenetic methods, we know much more about the origins, evolution and epidemiology of influenza epidemics. Here we review the history of avian influenza viruses through the lens of their genetic makeup: from their relationship to human pandemic viruses, starting with the 1918 H1N1 strain, through to the highly pathogenic epidemics in birds and zoonoses up to 2018. We describe the genesis of novel influenza A virus strains by reassortment and evolution in wild and domestic bird populations, as well as the role of wild bird migration in their long-range spread. The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the zoonotic incursions of avian H5 and H7 viruses into humans over the last couple of decades are also described. The threat of a new avian influenza virus causing a human pandemic is still present today, although control in domestic avian populations can minimize the risk to human health.

Title: Increased frequency of travel in the presence of cross-immunity may act to decrease the chance of a global pandemic.
Abstract: The high frequency of modern travel has led to concerns about a devastating pandemic since a lethal pathogen strain could spread worldwide quickly. Many historical pandemics have arisen following pathogen evolution to a more virulent form. However, some pathogen strains invoke immune responses that provide partial cross-immunity against infection with related strains. Here, we consider a mathematical model of successive outbreaks of two strains-a low virulence (LV) strain outbreak followed by a high virulence (HV) strain outbreak. Under these circumstances, we investigate the impacts of varying travel rates and cross-immunity on the probability that a major epidemic of the HV strain occurs, and the size of that outbreak. Frequent travel between subpopulations can lead to widespread immunity to the HV strain, driven by exposure to the LV strain. As a result, major epidemics of the HV strain are less likely, and can potentially be smaller, with more connected subpopulations. Cross-immunity may be a factor contributing to the absence of a global pandemic as severe as the 1918 influenza pandemic in the century since. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.

Title: Semi-perfusion cultures of suspension MDCK cells enable high cell concentrations and efficient influenza A virus production.
Abstract: Control and prevention of rapid influenza spread among humans depend on the availability of efficient and safe seasonal and pandemic vaccines, made primarily from inactivated influenza virus particles. Current influenza virus production processes rely heavily on embryonated chicken eggs or on cell culture as substrate for virus propagation. Today's efforts towards process intensification in animal cell culture could innovate viral vaccine manufacturing using high-yield suspension cells in high cell density perfusion processes. In this work, we present a MDCK cell line adapted to grow as single cell suspension with a doubling time of less than 20 h, achieving cell concentrations over 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL in batch mode. Influenza A virus titer obtained in batch infections were 3.6 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 µL) for total- and 10<sup>9</sup> virions/mL for infectious virus particles (TCID<sub>50</sub>), respectively. In semi-perfusion mode concentrations up to 6 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL, accumulated virus titer of 4.5 log<sub>10</sub>(HAU/100 µL) and infectious titer of almost 10<sup>10</sup> virions/mL (TCID<sub>50</sub>) were possible. This exceeds results reported previously for cell culture-based influenza virus propagation by far and suggests perfusion cultures as the preferred method in viral vaccine manufacturing.

Abstract: Here, we developed hCK, a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line that expresses high levels of human influenza virus receptors and low levels of avian virus receptors. hCK cells supported human A/H3N2 influenza virus isolation and growth much more effectively than conventional MDCK or human virus receptor-overexpressing (AX4) cells. A/H3N2 viruses propagated in hCK cells also maintained higher genetic stability than those propagated in MDCK and AX4 cells.

Title: Influenza a virus-triggered autophagy decreases the pluripotency of human-induced pluripotent stem cells.
Abstract: Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy was reported multiple times as the possible cause of many defects and congenital anomalies. Apart from several cases of influenza-related miscarriage during various trimesters of pregnancy, some epidemiological data suggest a link between maternal influenza infection and genetic abnormalities in offspring. However, there are no reports yet describing how maternal influenza alters cellular pathways at early stages of development to result in congenital defects in the fetus. In the present study, using proteomic approaches, we utilized human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for modeling intrablastocyst infection with influenza virus to not only investigate the vulnerability and responses of pluripotent stem cells to this virus but also to determine the possible impacts of influenza on pluripotency and signaling pathways controlling differentiation and embryogenesis. Our data indicated viral protein production in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected hiPSCs. However, viral replication was restricted in these cells, but cell viability and pluripotency were negatively affected. These events occurred simultaneously with an excessive level of IAV-induced autophagy as well as cytopathic effects. Quantitative SOMAscan screening also indicated that changes in the proteome of hiPSCs corresponded to abnormal differentiation in these cells. Taken together, our results showed that IAV-modulated reduction in hiPSC pluripotency is associated with significant activation of autophagy. Further investigations are required to explore the role of IAV-induced autophagy in leading pluripotent stem cells toward abnormal differentiation and impaired development in early stages of embryogenesis.

Title: Whole-genome Sequencing Provides Data for Stratifying Infection Prevention and Control Management of Nosocomial Influenza A.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics in humans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequencing have traditionally been used to identify the virus genotype, although their utility in detecting outbreak clusters is still unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the utility, if any, of whole-genome sequencing over HA/NA sequencing for infection prevention and control (IPC) in hospitals. We obtained all clinical samples from influenza (H1N1)-positive patients at the Great Ormond Street Hospital between January and March 2016. Samples were sequenced using targeted enrichment on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Maximum likelihood trees were computed for both whole genomes and concatenated HA/NA sequences. Epidemiological data was taken from routine IPC team activity during the period. Complete genomes were obtained for 65/80 samples from 38 patients. Conventional IPC analysis recognized 1 outbreak, involving 3 children, and identified another potential cluster in the haemato-oncology ward. Whole-genome and HA/NA phylogeny both accurately identified the previously known outbreak cluster. However, HA/NA sequencing additionally identified unrelated strains as part of this outbreak cluster. A whole-genome analysis identified a further cluster of 2 infections that had been previously missed and refuted suspicions of transmission in the haemato-oncology wards. Whole-genome sequencing is better at identifying outbreak clusters in a hospital setting than HA/NA sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing could provide a faster and more reliable method for outbreak monitoring and supplement routine IPC team work to allow the prevention of transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on whole-genome sequencing for infection control and outbreak monitoring, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Marine Fungi from the Sponge <i>Grantia compressa</i>: Biodiversity, Chemodiversity, and Biotechnological Potential.
Abstract: The emergence of antibiotic resistance and viruses with high epidemic potential made unexplored marine environments an appealing target source for new metabolites. Marine fungi represent one of the most suitable sources for the discovery of new compounds. Thus, the aim of this work was (i) to isolate and identify fungi associated with the Atlantic sponge <i>Grantia compressa</i>; (ii) to study the fungal metabolites by applying the OSMAC approach (one strain; many compounds); (iii) to test fungal compounds for their antimicrobial activities. Twenty-one fungal strains (17 taxa) were isolated from <i>G. compressa</i>. The OSMAC approach revealed an astonishing metabolic diversity in the marine fungus <i>Eurotium chevalieri</i> MUT 2316, from which 10 compounds were extracted, isolated, and characterized. All metabolites were tested against viruses and bacteria (reference and multidrug-resistant strains). Dihydroauroglaucin completely inhibited the replication of influenza A virus; as for herpes simplex virus 1, total inhibition of replication was observed for both physcion and neoechinulin D. Six out of 10 compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria with isodihydroauroglaucin being the most promising compound (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 4-64 µg/mL) with bactericidal activity. Overall, <i>G. compressa</i> proved to be an outstanding source of fungal diversity. Marine fungi were capable of producing different metabolites; in particular, the compounds isolated from <i>E. chevalieri</i> showed promising bioactivity against well-known and emerging pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates marine fungi metabolites and their antiviral activities, without links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Ducks induce rapid and robust antibody responses than chickens at early time after intravenous infection with H9N2 avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Compared with chickens, ducks are normally resistant to avian influenza virus without clinical signs while they habor almost all subtypes of influenza A viruses. To date, however the mechanism for duck anti-influenza has not been completely understood. The H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) is the most prevalent subtype of influenza A virus that infects chickens and ducks in China. However, H9N2 AIV replication and the host immune response in these domestic birds has not been systematically investigated. In the present study, we compared the kinetics and magnitudes of antibody responses in chickens and ducks after infection with H9N2 AIV by the intranasal route or intravenous route. Furthermore, we determined the viral replication and distribution in chickens and ducks after infection with H9N2 AIV by the intravenous route. Our results revealed that the antibody response was rapid and robust in ducks than in chickens at early time (2-3dpi) after intravenous infection with H9N2 AIVs, while delayed and lower antibody detected in ducks than in chickens after intranasal infection with H9N2 AIVs. The virus was detected in multiple organs tissues in chickens but not in ducks infected by the intravenous route. Our results provide the evidence that humoral immune response could play a critical role in duck resistance for influenza, which expands our knowledge on duck anti-influenza characteristics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares antibody responses and viral replication in ducks and chickens infected with H9N2 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Model-based analysis of influenza A virus replication in genetically engineered cell lines elucidates the impact of host cell factors on key kinetic parameters of virus growth.
Abstract: The best measure to limit spread of contagious diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs) is annual vaccination. The growing global demand for low-cost vaccines requires the establishment of high-yield production processes. One possible option to address this challenge is the engineering of novel vaccine producer cell lines by manipulating gene expression of host cell factors relevant for virus replication. To support detailed characterization of engineered cell lines, we fitted an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model of intracellular IAV replication previously established by our group to experimental data obtained from infection studies in human A549 cells. Model predictions indicate that steps of viral RNA synthesis, their regulation and particle assembly and virus budding are promising targets for cell line engineering. The importance of these steps was confirmed in four of five single gene overexpression cell lines (SGOs) that showed small, but reproducible changes in early dynamics of RNA synthesis and virus release. Model-based analysis suggests, however, that overexpression of the selected host cell factors negatively influences specific RNA synthesis rates. Still, virus yield was rescued by an increase in the virus release rate. Based on parameter estimations obtained for SGOs, we predicted that there is a potential benefit associated with overexpressing multiple host cell genes in one cell line, which was validated experimentally. Overall, this model-based study on IAV replication in engineered cell lines provides a step forward in the dynamic and quantitative characterization of IAV-host cell interactions. Furthermore, it suggests targets for gene editing and indicates that overexpression of multiple host cell factors may be beneficial for the design of novel producer cell lines.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host cell factors affecting influenza A virus replication kinetics in engineered cell lines, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus ribonucleoproteins form liquid organelles at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites.
Abstract: Influenza A virus has an eight-partite RNA genome that during viral assembly forms a complex containing one copy of each RNA. Genome assembly is a selective process driven by RNA-RNA interactions and is hypothesized to lead to discrete punctate structures scattered through the cytosol. Here, we show that contrary to the accepted view, formation of these structures precedes RNA-RNA interactions among distinct viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), as they assemble in cells expressing only one vRNP type. We demonstrate that these viral inclusions display characteristics of liquid organelles, segregating from the cytosol without a delimitating membrane, dynamically exchanging material and adapting fast to environmental changes. We provide evidence that viral inclusions develop close to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites, depend on continuous ER-Golgi vesicular cycling and do not promote escape to interferon response. We propose that viral inclusions segregate vRNPs from the cytosol and facilitate selected RNA-RNA interactions in a liquid environment.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the formation of viral ribonucleoprotein inclusions and their biophysical properties, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Circular RNA GATAD2A promotes H1N1 replication through inhibiting autophagy.
Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in various diseases. However, whether and how circular RNA regulates influenza A virus (IAV) infection is unknown. Here, we studied the role of circular RNA GATA Zinc Finger Domain Containing 2A (circ-GATAD2A) in the replication of IAV H1N1 in A549 cells. Circ-GATAD2A was formed upon H1N1 infection. Knockdown of circ-GATAD2A in A549 cells enhanced autophagy and inhibited H1N1 replication. By contrast, overexpression of circ-GATAD2A impaired autophagy and promoted H1N1 replication. Similarly, knockout of vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) blocked autophagy and increased H1N1 replication. However, the expression of circ-GATAD2A could not further enhance H1N1 replication in VPS34 knockout cells. Collectively, these data indicated that circ-GATAD2A promotes the replication of H1N1 by inhibiting autophagy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the role of a host circular RNA in promoting H1N1 replication via autophagy inhibition, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Full-length human surfactant protein A inhibits influenza A virus infection of A549 lung epithelial cells: A recombinant form containing neck and lectin domains promotes infectivity.
Abstract: Hydrophilic lung surfactant proteins have emerged as key immunomodulators which are potent at the recognition and clearance of pulmonary pathogens. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a surfactant-associated innate immune molecule, which is known to interact with a variety of pathogens, and display anti-microbial effects. SP-A, being a carbohydrate pattern recognition molecule, has a wide range of innate immune functions against respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus (IAV). Some pandemic pH1N1 strains resist neutralization by SP-A due to differences in the N-glycosylation of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Here, we provide evidence, for the first time, that a recombinant form of human SP-A (rfhSP-A), composed of α-helical neck and carbohydrate recognition domains, can actually promote the IAV replication, as observed by an upregulation of M1 expression in lung epithelial cell line, A549, when challenged with pH1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes. rfhSP-A (10 μg/ml) bound neuraminidase (NA) (∼60 kDa), matrix protein 1 (M1) (∼25 kDa) and M2 (∼17 kDa) in a calcium dependent manner, as revealed by far western blotting, and direct binding ELISA. However, human full length native SP-A downregulated mRNA expression levels of M1 in A549 cells challenged with IAV subtypes. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed that transcriptional levels of TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IFN-α and RANTES were enhanced following rfhSP-A treatment by both IAV subtypes at 6 h post-IAV infection of A549 lung epithelial cells. In the case of full length SP-A treatment, mRNA expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were downregulated during the mid-to-late stage of IAV infection of A549 cells. Multiplex cytokine/chemokine array revealed enhanced levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α due to rfhSP-A treatment in the case of both IAV subtypes tested, while no significant effect was seen in the case of IL-12. Enhancement of IAV infection of pH1N1 and H3N2 subtypes by truncated rfhSP-A, concomitant with infection inhibition by full-length SP-A, appears to suggest that a complete SP-A molecule is required for protection against IAV. This is in contrast to a recombinant form of trimeric lectin domains of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) that acts as an entry inhibitor of IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines effects of surfactant protein A forms on influenza infection in cells, focusing on host-pathogen interactions without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Anti-H7N9 avian influenza A virus activity of interferon in pseudostratified human airway epithelium cell cultures.
Abstract: Since H7N9 influenza A virus (H7N9) was first reported in 2013, five waves of outbreaks have occurred, posing a huge threat to human health. In preparation for a potential H7N9 epidemic, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of anti-H7N9 drugs with an appropriate model. Well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium (HAE) cells were grown at the air-liquid interface, and the H7N9 cell tropism and cytopathic effect were detected by immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The H7N9 replication kinetics and anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human α2b (rhIFN-α2b) and rhIFN-λ1 were compared with different cell lines. The H7N9 viral load and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were quantified by real-time PCR assays. H7N9 could infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells within the three-dimensional (3D) HAE cell culture, which reduced the number of cilia and damaged the airways. The H7N9 replication kinetics differed between traditional cells and 3D HAE cells. Interferon had antiviral activity against H7N9 and alleviated epithelial cell lesions; the antiviral activity of rhIFN-α2b was slightly better than that of rhIFN-λ1. In normal cells, rhIFN-α2b induced a greater amount of ISG expression (MX1, OAS1, IFITM3, and ISG15) compared with rhIFN-λ1, but in 3D HAE cells, this trend was reversed. Both rhIFN-α2b and rhIFN-λ1 had antiviral activity against H7N9, and this protection was related to the induction of ISGs. The 3D cell culture model is suitable for evaluating interferon antiviral activity because it can demonstrate realistic in vivo-like effects.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates interferon antiviral activity against H7N9 virus in cell culture models, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Identification of NMS-873, an allosteric and specific p97 inhibitor, as a broad antiviral against both influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The limited efficacy of oseltamivir in delayed treatment, coupled with the increasing incidences of oseltamivir-resistant strains, calls for next-generation of antiviral drugs. In this study, we discovered NMS-873, an allosteric and specific p97 inhibitor, as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral through forward chemical genomics screening. NMS-873 shows potent antiviral activity with low-nanomolar EC<sub>50</sub>s against multiple human influenza A and B viruses, including adamantine-, oseltamivir-, or double resistant strains. Our data further showed that silencing of p97 via siRNA or inhibiting p97 by NMS-873 both inhibited virus replication and retained viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) in the nucleus, confirming p97 is the drug target. Mechanistic studies have shown that the nuclear retention of vRNP with NMS-873 treatment is a combined result of two effects: the reduced viral M1 protein level (indirect effect), and the disruption of p97-NP interactions (direct effect). Taken together, our results suggest that p97 could be a novel antiviral target and its inhibitor, NMS-873, is a promising antiviral drug candidate.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a host protein inhibitor as an antiviral against influenza viruses, focusing on host-targeted antiviral mechanisms rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: RNA Sequence Features Are at the Core of Influenza A Virus Genome Packaging.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV), a respiratory pathogen for humans, poses serious medical and economic challenges to global healthcare systems. The IAV genome, consisting of eight single-stranded viral RNA segments, is incorporated into virions by a complex process known as genome packaging. Specific RNA sequences within the viral RNA segments serve as signals that are necessary for genome packaging. Although efficient packaging is a prerequisite for viral infectivity, many of the mechanistic details about this process are still missing. In this review, we discuss the recent advances toward the understanding of IAV genome packaging and focus on the RNA features that play a role in this process.
Relevant: False

Title: CXCR6-Deficiency Improves the Control of Pulmonary <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and Influenza Infection Independent of T-Lymphocyte Recruitment to the Lungs.
Abstract: T-lymphocytes are critical for protection against respiratory infections, such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and influenza virus, with chemokine receptors playing an important role in directing these cells to the lungs. CXCR6 is expressed by activated T-lymphocytes and its ligand, CXCL16, is constitutively expressed by the bronchial epithelia, suggesting a role in T-lymphocyte recruitment and retention. However, it is unknown whether CXCR6 is required in responses to pulmonary infection, particularly on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes. Analysis of CXCR6-reporter mice revealed that in naïve mice, lung leukocyte expression of CXCR6 was largely restricted to a small population of T-lymphocytes, but this population was highly upregulated after either infection. Nevertheless, pulmonary infection of CXCR6-deficient mice with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> or recombinant influenza A virus expressing P25 peptide (rIAV-P25), an I-A<sup>b</sup>-restricted epitope from the immunodominant mycobacterial antigen, Ag85B, demonstrated that the receptor was redundant for recruitment of T-lymphocytes to the lungs. Interestingly, CXCR6-deficiency resulted in reduced bacterial burden in the lungs 6 weeks after <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection, and reduced weight loss after rIAV-P25 infection compared to wild type controls. This was paradoxically associated with a decrease in Th1-cytokine responses in the lung parenchyma. Adoptive transfer of P25-specific CXCR6-deficient T-lymphocytes into WT mice revealed that this functional change in Th1-cytokine production was not due to a T-lymphocyte intrinsic mechanism. Moreover, there was no reduction in the number or function of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory cells in the lungs of CXCR6-deficient mice. Although CXCR6 was not required for T-lymphocyte recruitment or retention in the lungs, CXCR6 influenced the kinetics of the inflammatory response so that deficiency led to increased host control of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and influenza virus.

Title: Cardiac glycosides decrease influenza virus replication by inhibiting cell protein translational machinery.
Abstract: Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are used primarily for cardiac failure and have been reported to have other effects, including inhibition of viral replication. Here we set out to study mechanisms by which CGs as inhibitors of the Na-K-ATPase decrease influenza A virus (IAV) replication in the lungs. We found that CGs inhibit influenza virus replication in alveolar epithelial cells by decreasing intracellular potassium, which in turn inhibits protein translation, independently of viral entry, mRNA transcription, and protein degradation. These effects were independent of the Src signaling pathway and intracellular calcium concentration changes. We found that short-term treatment with ouabain prevented IAV replication without cytotoxicity. Rodents express a Na-K-ATPase-α1 resistant to CGs. Thus we utilized Na-K-ATPase-α<sub>1</sub>-sensitive mice, infected them with high doses of influenza virus, and observed a modest survival benefit when treated with ouabain. In summary, we provide evidence that the inhibition of the Na-K-ATPase by CGs decreases influenza A viral replication by modulating the cell protein translational machinery and results in a modest survival benefit in mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies how cardiac glycosides inhibit influenza replication by targeting host cell protein translation, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: RNAi-based small molecule repositioning reveals clinically approved urea-based kinase inhibitors as broadly active antivirals.
Abstract: Influenza viruses (IVs) tend to rapidly develop resistance to virus-directed vaccines and common antivirals targeting pathogen determinants, but novel host-directed approaches might preclude resistance development. To identify the most promising cellular targets for a host-directed approach against influenza, we performed a comparative small interfering RNA (siRNA) loss-of-function screen of IV replication in A549 cells. Analysis of four different IV strains including a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain, an influenza B virus (IBV) and two human influenza A viruses (IAVs) revealed 133 genes required by all four IV strains. According to gene enrichment analyses, these strain-independent host genes were particularly enriched for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In addition, 360 strain-specific genes were identified with distinct patterns of usage for IAVs versus IBV and human versus avian IVs. The strain-independent host genes served to define 43 experimental and otherwise clinically approved drugs, targeting reportedly fourteen of the encoded host factors. Amongst the approved drugs, the urea-based kinase inhibitors (UBKIs) regorafenib and sorafenib exhibited a superior therapeutic window of high IV antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity. Both UBKIs appeared to block a cell signaling pathway involved in IV replication after internalization, yet prior to vRNP uncoating. Interestingly, both compounds were active also against unrelated viruses including cowpox virus (CPXV), hantavirus (HTV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and showed antiviral efficacy in human primary respiratory cells. An in vitro resistance development analysis for regorafenib failed to detect IV resistance development against this drug. Taken together, the otherwise clinically approved UBKIs regorafenib and sorafenib possess high and broad-spectrum antiviral activity along with substantial robustness against resistance development and thus constitute attractive host-directed drug candidates against a range of viral infections including influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host-directed antiviral targets and drug repositioning without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A Novel Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Bireporter Influenza A Virus To Evaluate Viral Infections.
Abstract: Studying influenza A virus (IAV) requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of virus in infected cells. To overcome this problem, we and others have generated recombinant IAV expressing fluorescent or luciferase reporter genes. These foreign reporter genes can be used as valid surrogates to track the presence of virus. However, the limited capacity for incorporating foreign sequences in the viral genome forced researchers to select a fluorescent or a luciferase reporter gene, depending on the type of study. To circumvent this limitation, we engineered a novel recombinant replication-competent bireporter IAV (BIRFLU) expressing both fluorescent and luciferase reporter genes. In cultured cells, BIRFLU displayed growth kinetics comparable to those of wild-type (WT) virus and was used to screen neutralizing antibodies or compounds with antiviral activity. The expression of two reporter genes allows monitoring of viral inhibition by fluorescence or bioluminescence, overcoming the limitations associated with the use of one reporter gene as a readout. <i>In vivo</i>, BIRFLU effectively infected mice, and both reporter genes were detected using <i>in vivo</i> imaging systems (IVIS). The ability to generate recombinant IAV harboring multiple foreign genes opens unique possibilities for studying virus-host interactions and for using IAV in high-throughput screenings (HTS) to identify novel antivirals that can be incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium to control IAV infections. Moreover, the ability to genetically manipulate the viral genome to express two foreign genes offers the possibility of developing novel influenza vaccines and the feasibility for using recombinant IAV as vaccine vectors to treat other pathogen infections.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a human respiratory disease that is associated with significant health and economic consequences. In recent years, the use of replication-competent IAV expressing an easily traceable fluorescent or luciferase reporter protein has significantly contributed to progress in influenza research. However, researchers have been forced to select a fluorescent or a luciferase reporter gene due to the restricted capacity of the influenza viral genome for including foreign sequences. To overcome this limitation, we generated, for the first time, a recombinant replication-competent bireporter IAV (BIRFLU) that stably expresses two reporter genes (one fluorescent and one luciferase) to track IAV infections <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> The combination of cutting-edge techniques from molecular biology, animal research, and imaging technologies brings researchers the unique opportunity to use this new generation of reporter-expressing IAV to study viral infection dynamics in both cultured cells and animal models of viral infection.

Title: The clinically licensed antifungal drug itraconazole inhibits influenza virus in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common pathogen of respiratory disease. The IAV-induced seasonal epidemics and the sporadic pandemics are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, effective protection and therapy for IAV infections is an important challenge in countering this public health threat. Because vaccinations only protect against known circulating strains, and the currently available antivirals pose the risk of resistance formation, drugs targeting host cell factors needed for viral replication offer a promising therapeutic approach. In this study, we describe the use of the antifungal therapeutics posaconazole and itraconazole in the therapy of IAV. We show that both drugs efficiently inhibit the propagation of IAV in the cell culture model without being cytotoxic. The mode of action is probably based on several targets and includes both a priming of the interferon response and the induced imbalance of cellular cholesterol. The antiviral effect of itraconazole could be confirmed in the mouse model, where the administration of itraconazole led to a drastic reduction in mortality and a significant increase in the survival rate. Thus, our data indicate a promising therapeutic potential of at least itraconazole in influenza therapy.

Title: Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP).
Abstract: Subspecies nomenclature systems of pathogens are increasingly based on sequence data. The use of phylogenetics to identify and differentiate between clusters of genetically similar pathogens is particularly prevalent in virology from the nomenclature of human papillomaviruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx viruses. These nomenclature systems rely on absolute genetic distance thresholds to define the maximum genetic divergence tolerated between viruses designated as closely related. However, the phylogenetic clustering methods used in these nomenclature systems are limited by the arbitrariness of setting intra and intercluster diversity thresholds. The lack of a consensus ground truth to define well-delineated, meaningful phylogenetic subpopulations amplifies the difficulties in identifying an informative distance threshold. Consequently, phylogenetic clustering often becomes an exploratory, ad hoc exercise. Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP) was developed to provide a statistically principled phylogenetic clustering framework that negates the need for an arbitrarily defined distance threshold. Using the pairwise patristic distance distributions of an input phylogeny, PhyCLIP parameterizes the intra and intercluster divergence limits as statistical bounds in an integer linear programming model which is subsequently optimized to cluster as many sequences as possible. When applied to the hemagglutinin phylogeny of HPAI H5Nx viruses, PhyCLIP was not only able to recapitulate the current WHO/OIE/FAO H5 nomenclature system but also further delineated informative higher resolution clusters that capture geographically distinct subpopulations of viruses. PhyCLIP is pathogen-agnostic and can be generalized to a wide variety of research questions concerning the identification of biologically informative clusters in pathogen phylogenies.

Title: Identification, design and synthesis of novel pyrazolopyridine influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 antagonists.
Abstract: Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays a crucial function in the replication, spread, and pathogenesis of influenza virus by inhibiting the host innate immune response. Here we report the discovery and optimization of novel pyrazolopyridine NS1 antagonists that can potently inhibit influenza A/PR/8/34 replication in MDCK cells, rescue MDCK cells from cytopathic effects of seasonal influenza A strains, reverse NS1-dependent inhibition of IFN-β gene expression, and suppress the slow growth phenotype in NS1-expressing yeast. These pyrazolopyridines will enable researchers to investigate NS1 function during infection and how antagonists can be utilized in the next generation of treatments for influenza infection.

Title: High titer MVA and influenza A virus production using a hybrid fed-batch/perfusion strategy with an ATF system.
Abstract: A cultivation strategy to increase the productivity of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus in high-cell density processes is presented. Based on an approach developed in shake flask cultures, this strategy was established in benchtop bioreactors, comprising the growth of suspension AGE1.CR.pIX cells to high cell densities in a chemically defined medium before infection with the MVA-CR19 virus strain. First, a perfusion regime was established to optimize the cell growth phase. Second, a fed-batch regime was chosen for the initial infection phase to facilitate virus uptake and cell-to-cell spreading. Afterwards, a switch to perfusion enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for the late stages of virus propagation. With maximum infectious titers of 1.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> IU/mL, this hybrid fed-batch/perfusion strategy increased product titers by almost one order of magnitude compared to conventional batch cultivations. Finally, this strategy was also applied to the production of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus considered for manufacturing of inactivated vaccines. Using the same culture system, a total number of 3.8 × 10<sup>10</sup> virions/mL was achieved. Overall, comparable or even higher cell-specific virus yields and volumetric productivities were obtained using the same cultivation systems as for the conventional batch cultivations. In addition, most viral particles were found in the culture supernatant, which can simplify further downstream operations, in particular for MVA viruses. Considering the current availability of well-described perfusion/cell retention technologies, the present strategy may contribute to the development of new approaches for viral vaccine production.

Title: Intranasal and epicutaneous administration of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists provides protection against influenza A virus-induced morbidity in mice.
Abstract: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes viral RNA following endocytosis of the virus and initiates a powerful immune response characterized by Type I IFN production and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Despite this immune response, the virus causes very significant pathology, which may be inflammation-dependent. In the present study, we examined the effect of intranasal delivery of the TLR7 agonist, imiquimod or its topical formulation Aldara, on the inflammation and pathogenesis caused by IAV infection. In mice, daily intranasal delivery of imiquimod prevented peak viral replication, bodyweight loss, airway and pulmonary inflammation, and lung neutrophils. Imiquimod treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic cytokines and prevented the increase in viral-induced lung dysfunction. Various antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, total IgG, IgE and IgM), which were increased in the BALF following influenza A virus infection, were further increased with imiquimod. While epicutaneous application of Aldara had a significant effect on body weight, it did not reduce neutrophil and eosinophil airway infiltration; indicating less effective drug delivery for this formulation. We concluded that intranasal imiquimod facilitates a more effective immune response, which can limit the pathology associated with influenza A virus infection.

Title: DMO-CAP inhibits influenza virus replication by activating heme oxygenase-1-mediated IFN response.
Abstract: As a leading cause of respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection remains a pandemic threat in annual seasonal outbreaks. Given the limitation of existing anti-influenza therapeutic drugs, development of new drugs is urgently required. Flavonoids extracted from Artemisia rupestris L. have an inhibitory effect on virus infections. Despite this fact, the antiviral properties of 6-demethoxy-4'-O-methylcapillarisin (DMO-CAP), one of such flavonoids, against the influenza virus have not been reported. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the anti-IAV virus efficacy and antiviral mechanism of DMO-CAP. The inhibitory activity of DMO-CAP against IAV was detected in vitro using viral titers by Western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. The mechanism of DMO-CAP against influenza virus was analyzed by Western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, and luciferase assay. DMO-CAP exhibits broad spectrum of antiviral activities against IAV in vitro. Mechanistically, DMO-CAP treatment induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), JNK MAPK, and ERK MAPK, which led to the activation of Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. Then, the up-regulation of HO-1 expression activated the IFN response and induced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, thereby leading to efficient anti-IAV effects. DMO-CAP inhibited IAV replication by activating HO-1-mediated IFN response. DMO-CAP may be a potential agent or supplement against IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the antiviral mechanism of a compound (DMO-CAP) against influenza virus replication, focusing on host pathways rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Viral infection detection using metagenomics technology in six poultry farms of eastern China.
Abstract: With rapidly increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements, new technologies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of pathogens in the occurrence and development of animal diseases. We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study uses metagenomics to detect viral infections in poultry farms but does not analyze genotype-phenotype links.

Title: MicroRNA expression profiles from HEK293 cells expressing H5N1 avian influenza virus non-structural protein 1.
Abstract: H5N1 avian influenza poses a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays an important role in the replication and pathogenesis of avian influenza virus (AIV). However, the function of the NS1 gene is still unclear. In this study, illumina genome analyzer iix screening was used to identify the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in HEK293 cells expressing H5N1 AIV NS1. There were 13 differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-3613-3p, hsa-miR-3178, hsa-miR-4505, hsa-miR-345-3p, hsa-miR-3648, and hsa-miR-455-3p) ( P < 0.01). The qRT-PCR validation results demonstrated that hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, and hsa-miR-3613-3p were upregulated, while hsa-miR-3178 and hsa-miR-4505 were down-regulated. The softwares targetscan and miranda were further used to predict their target genes, and the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis results showed that 20 GO terms and 20 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched. Our findings are the first to report expression profiling of miRNA and their functions in H5N1 AIV NS1-expressing HEK293 cells, and pave the way to further elucidating the accurate interaction mechanism between NS1 and virus replication, thus providing brand new insight into the prophylaxis and treatment of H5N1 AIV.

Title: Multiscale modeling of influenza A virus replication in cell cultures predicts infection dynamics for highly different infection conditions.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of IAV replication have paid little attention to the impact of the MOI on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of IAV replication in adherent MDCK cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high MOI measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low MOI experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle (DIP) propagation in different MOI regimes. The key difference between high and low MOI conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that DIP interference at a high MOI is determined exclusively by the DIP content of the seed virus while, in low MOI conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the de novo generation of DIPs. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived IAV manufacturing and the production of DIPs for therapeutic use.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study of influenza virus replication dynamics in cell culture, focusing on infection conditions rather than genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Global transcriptome analysis of H5N1 influenza virus-infected human cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) belongs to the <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i> family. IAV causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans that exacts severe economic losses globally. The virus uses strategies developed to exploit and subvert cellular proteins and pathways to increase its own replication and to inhibit antiviral immune response. A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/QH) was able to infect A549 and 293 T cells, with a high infection rate for A549 cells. To identify host cellular responses of human cells to influenza infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AIV-infected groups and uninfected controls were identified using RNA-sequencing. The DEGs were annotated by Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which revealed that the DEGs were mainly linked to cellular function and metabolic processes, while the cellular function that is probably associated with host cellular response of human cells, including defense response to virus and protein modification. All the DEGs and pathways were possibly involved in the response to IAV invasion. The global transcriptome analysis results revealed that sensitive genes and pathways of the cells were infected with the influenza virus and provided further evidence to investigate the complicated relationship between IAV and host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: This transcriptome analysis focuses on host cellular responses to H5N1 infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States, September 30, 2018-February 2, 2019.
Abstract: CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity and viruses in the United States. During September 30, 2018-February 2, 2019,* influenza activity<sup>†</sup> in the United States was low during October and November, increased in late December, and remained elevated through early February. As of February 2, 2019, this has been a low-severity influenza season (1), with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), lower rates of hospitalization, and fewer deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza, compared with recent seasons. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates among children are similar to those observed in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant seasons; 28 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2018-19 season have been reported to CDC. Whereas influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in most areas of the country, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated in the southeastern United States, and in recent weeks accounted for a growing proportion of influenza viruses detected in several other regions. Small numbers of influenza B viruses (<3% of all influenza-positive tests performed by public health laboratories) also were reported. The majority of the influenza viruses characterized antigenically are similar to the cell culture-propagated reference viruses representing the 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. Health care providers should continue to offer and encourage vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Finally, regardless of vaccination status, it is important that persons with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza complications be treated with antiviral medications.

Title: Repurposing of Drugs as Novel Influenza Inhibitors From Clinical Gene Expression Infection Signatures.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections remain a major and recurrent public health burden. The intrinsic ever-evolving nature of this virus, the suboptimal efficacy of current influenza inactivated vaccines, as well as the emergence of resistance against a limited antiviral arsenal, highlight the critical need for novel therapeutic approaches. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop and validate an innovative strategy for drug repurposing as host-targeted inhibitors of influenza viruses and the rapid evaluation of the most promising candidates in Phase II clinical trials. We exploited <i>in vivo</i> global transcriptomic signatures of infection directly obtained from a patient cohort to determine a shortlist of already marketed drugs with newly identified, host-targeted inhibitory properties against influenza virus. The antiviral potential of selected repurposing candidates was further evaluated <i>in vitro, in vivo</i>, and <i>ex vivo</i>. Our strategy allowed the selection of a shortlist of 35 high potential candidates out of a rationalized computational screening of 1,309 FDA-approved bioactive molecules, 31 of which were validated for their significant <i>in vitro</i> antiviral activity. Our <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> results highlight diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker currently used in the treatment of hypertension, as a promising option for the treatment of influenza infections. Additionally, transcriptomic signature analysis further revealed the so far undescribed capacity of diltiazem to modulate the expression of specific genes related to the host antiviral response and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, combination treatment with diltiazem and virus-targeted oseltamivir neuraminidase inhibitor further increased antiviral efficacy, prompting rapid authorization for the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial. This original, host-targeted, drug repurposing strategy constitutes an effective and highly reactive process for the rapid identification of novel anti-infectious drugs, with potential major implications for the management of antimicrobial resistance and the rapid response to future epidemic or pandemic (re)emerging diseases for which we are still disarmed.

Title: In silico re-assessment of a diagnostic RT-qPCR assay for universal detection of Influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The ongoing evolution of microbial pathogens represents a significant issue in diagnostic PCR/qPCR. Many assays are burdened with false negativity due to mispriming and/or probe-binding failures. Therefore, PCR/qPCR assays used in the laboratory should be periodically re-assessed in silico on public sequences to evaluate the ability to detect actually circulating strains and to infer potentially escaping variants. In the work presented we re-assessed a RT-qPCR assay for the universal detection of influenza A (IA) viruses currently recommended by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza. To this end, the primers and probe sequences were challenged against more than 99,000 M-segment sequences in five data pools. To streamline this process, we developed a simple algorithm called the SequenceTracer designed for alignment stratification, compression, and personal sequence subset selection and also demonstrated its utility. The re-assessment confirmed the high inclusivity of the assay for the detection of avian, swine and human pandemic H1N1 IA viruses. On the other hand, the analysis identified human H3N2 strains with a critical probe-interfering mutation circulating since 2010, albeit with a significantly fluctuating proportion. Minor variations located in the forward and reverse primers identified in the avian and swine data were also considered.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an in silico re-assessment of a diagnostic RT-qPCR assay's ability to detect viral genotypes; it does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Dynamic Perspectives on the Search for a Universal Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: A universal influenza vaccine (UIV) could considerably alleviate the public health burden of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Although significant progress has been achieved in clarifying basic immunology and virology relating to UIV, several important questions relating to the dynamics of infection, immunity, and pathogen evolution remain unsolved. In this study, we review these gaps, which span integrative levels, from cellular to global and timescales from molecular events to decades. We argue that they can be best addressed by a tight integration of empirical (laboratory, epidemiological) research and theory and suggest fruitful areas for this synthesis. In particular, quantifying natural and vaccinal limitations on viral transmission are central to this effort.

Title: Antibody Determinants of Influenza Immunity.
Abstract: Understanding antigenic variation in influenza virus strains and how the human immune system recognizes strains are central challenges for vaccinologists. Antibodies directed to the 2 major viral surface membrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), mediate protection against reinfection following natural infection or vaccination, but HA and NA protein sequences in field strains are highly variable. The central questions are how to achieve protective antibody responses in a higher proportion of individuals and how to induce responses with more breadth and durability. Studies using isolation of human monoclonal antibodies followed by structural and functional characterization revealed conserved antigenic sites recognized by broadly cross-reactive antibodies. The antigenic landscape on HA and NA proteins is coming into focus to inform studies of the correlates and mechanisms of immunity. Understanding the antibody determinants of influenza immunity points the way toward development and testing of next-generation vaccines with potential to confer broadly protective immunity.

Title: Neuraminidase, the Forgotten Surface Antigen, Emerges as an Influenza Vaccine Target for Broadened Protection.
Abstract: For 50 years it has been known that antibodies to neuraminidase (NA) protect against infection during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. However, NA is largely ignored in the formulation and standardization of our current influenza vaccines. There are a number of factors that contributed to this antigen being forgotten, including the lack of an easily performed test to measure NA antibody. With the availability of that test, it has been possible to show its independent contribution to protection in various situations. The challenge now is to make it possible to include known amounts of NA in investigational vaccines or to routinely measure NA content in licensed vaccines. Vaccines containing optimal amounts of NA may be particularly useful when there are antigenic changes, either drift or shift, in the hemagglutinin because NA immunity offers broad protection. It is now time to remember the NA as we work toward improved influenza vaccines.

Title: Universal Influenza Virus Vaccines That Target the Conserved Hemagglutinin Stalk and Conserved Sites in the Head Domain.
Abstract: Due to limitations of current influenza virus vaccines, new vaccines that mediate broad protection and show high efficacy against seasonal and pandemic viruses are urgently needed. The conserved stalk of the viral hemagglutinin has been identified as potential target antigen for this new generation of vaccines. A vaccination strategy based on chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA), which refocuses the immune response toward the stalk domain and the conserved neuraminidase, is currently being tested in clinical trials. Here we discuss how to improve the cHA antigens to generate vaccine candidates that both induce a broad antistalk response and target conserved immunosubdominant epitopes in the head domain of the hemagglutinin. These novel constructs, termed mosaic hemagglutinins, should provide enhanced protection and should be tested in clinical trials to assess their improved potential as universal influenza virus vaccine candidates.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing vaccine strategies targeting conserved HA domains, without direct experimental genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Making Universal Influenza Vaccines: Lessons From the 1918 Pandemic.
Abstract: The year 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history. In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza spread globally and caused an estimated 50-100 million deaths associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The descendants of the 1918 virus continue to circulate as annual epidemic viruses causing significant mortality each year. The 1918 influenza pandemic serves as a benchmark for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Challenges to producing a truly universal influenza vaccine include eliciting broad protection against antigenically different influenza viruses that can prevent or significantly downregulate viral replication and reduce morbidity by preventing development of viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Perhaps the most important goal of such vaccines is not to prevent influenza, but to prevent influenza deaths.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on lessons from the 1918 pandemic for universal vaccine development, without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: Characterization of Host and Bacterial Contributions to Lung Barrier Dysfunction Following Co-infection with 2009 Pandemic Influenza and Methicillin Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are a threat to global public health resulting in ~500,000 deaths each year. Despite an intensive vaccination program, influenza infections remain a recurrent, yet unsolved public health problem. Secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate influenza infections during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA), is frequently associated with these co-infections, including the 2009 influenza pandemic. Damage to alveolar epithelium is a major contributor to severe influenza-bacterial co-infections and can result in gas exchange abnormalities, fluid leakage, and respiratory insufficiency. These deleterious manifestations likely involve both pathogen- and host-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms (pathogen- and/or host-mediated) underlying influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis. To address this, we characterized the contributions of viral-, bacterial-, and host-mediated factors to the altered structure and function of alveolar epithelial cells during co-infection with a focus on the 2009 pandemic influenza (pdm2009) and MRSA. Here, we characterized pdm2009 and MRSA replication kinetics, temporal host kinome responses, modulation of MRSA virulence factors, and disruption of alveolar barrier integrity in response to pdm2009-MRSA co-infection. Our results suggest that alveolar barrier disruption during co-infection is mediated primarily through host response dysregulation, resulting in loss of alveolar barrier integrity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes host and bacterial contributions to lung barrier dysfunction during co-infection, focusing on host-pathogen interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Long non-coding RNA PSMB8-AS1 regulates influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new arm of gene regulatory mechanism as discovered by sequencing techniques and follow-up functional studies. There are only few studies on lncRNAs as related to gene expression regulation and anti-viral activity during influenza virus infection. We sought to identify and characterize lncRNAs involved in influenza virus replication. Using RNA sequencing analysis, we found that 1,912 lncRNAs were significantly changed in human lung epithelial A549 cells infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Gene ontology analysis on neighboring genes of these lncRNAs revealed that the genes involved in type I interferon signaling and cellular response were highly enriched. Seven selected up-regulated lncRNAs (AC015849.2, RP-1-7H24.1, PSMB8-AS1, CTD-2639E6.9, PSOR1C3, AC007283.5 and RP11-670E13.5) were verified by real-time PCR. These lncRNAs were also induced by other two influenza H1N1 virus strains (A/WSN/1933 and A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and interferon β1. Repression of PSMB8 antisense RNA 1 (PSMB8-AS1) using CRISPR interference reduced viral mRNA and protein levels as well as the release of progeny influenza virus particles. Our study suggests that lncRNA PSMB8-AS1 could be a new host factor target for developing antiviral therapy against influenza virus infection.

Title: Epigenetic Modification Is Regulated by the Interaction of Influenza A Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 with the <i>De Novo</i> DNA Methyltransferase DNMT3B and Subsequent Transport to the Cytoplasm for K48-Linked Polyubiquitination.
Abstract: The influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a nonstructural protein that plays a major role in antagonizing host interferon responses during infection. However, a clear role for the NS1 protein in epigenetic modification has not been established. In this study, NS1 was found to regulate the expression of some key regulators of JAK-STAT signaling by inhibiting the DNA methylation of their promoters. Furthermore, DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is responsible for this process. Upon investigating the mechanisms underlying this event, NS1 was found to interact with DNMT3B but not DNMT3A, leading to the dissociation of DNMT3B from the promoters of the corresponding genes. In addition, the interaction between NS1 and DNMT3B changed the localization of DNMT3B from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of DNMT3B in the cytosol. We conclude that NS1 interacts with DNMT3B and changes its localization to mediate K48-linked polyubiquitination, subsequently contributing to the modulation of the expression of JAK-STAT signaling suppressors.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus (IAV) is a multifunctional protein that counters cellular antiviral activities and is a virulence factor. However, the involvement of NS1 in DNA methylation during IAV infection has not been established. Here, we reveal that the NS1 protein binds the cellular DNMT3B DNA methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting the methylation of the promoters of genes encoding suppressors of JAK-STAT signaling. As a result, these suppressor genes are induced, and JAK-STAT signaling is inhibited. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NS1 protein transports DNMT3B to the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, we identify the NS1 protein as a potential trigger of the epigenetic deregulation of JAK-STAT signaling suppressors and illustrate a novel mechanism underlying the regulation of host immunity during IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on interaction of viral NS1 protein with host DNMT3B and epigenetic regulation, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The Nonstructural NS1 Protein of Influenza Viruses Modulates <i>TP53</i> Splicing through Host Factor CPSF4.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are known to modulate and "hijack" several cellular host mechanisms, including gene splicing and RNA maturation machineries. These modulations alter host cellular responses and enable an optimal expression of viral products throughout infection. The interplay between the host protein p53 and IAV, in particular through the viral nonstructural protein NS1, has been shown to be supportive for IAV replication. However, it remains unknown whether alternatively spliced isoforms of p53, known to modulate p53 transcriptional activity, are affected by IAV infection and contribute to IAV replication. Using a <i>TP53</i> minigene, which mimics intron 9 alternative splicing, we have shown here that the NS1 protein of IAV changes the expression pattern of p53 isoforms. Our results demonstrate that CPSF4 (cellular protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 4) independently and the interaction between NS1 and CPSF4 modulate the alternative splicing of <i>TP53</i> transcripts, which may result in the differential activation of p53-responsive genes. Finally, we report that CPSF4 and most likely beta and gamma spliced p53 isoforms affect both viral replication and IAV-associated type I interferon secretion. All together, our data show that cellular p53 and CPSF4 factors, both interacting with viral NS1, have a crucial role during IAV replication that allows IAV to interact with and alter the expression of alternatively spliced p53 isoforms in order to regulate the cellular innate response, especially via type I interferon secretion, and perform efficient viral replication.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A viruses (IAV) constitute a major public health issue, causing illness and death in high-risk populations during seasonal epidemics or pandemics. IAV are known to modulate cellular pathways to promote their replication and avoid immune restriction via the targeting of several cellular proteins. One of these proteins, p53, is a master regulator involved in a large panel of biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence. This "cellular gatekeeper" is also involved in the control of viral infections, and viruses have developed a wide diversity of mechanisms to modulate/hijack p53 functions to achieve an optimal replication in their hosts. Our group and others have previously shown that p53 activity is finely modulated by different multilevel mechanisms during IAV infection. Here, we characterized IAV nonstructural protein NS1 and the cellular factor CPSF4 as major partners involved in the IAV-induced modulation of the <i>TP53</i> alternative splicing that was associated with a strong modulation of p53 activity and notably the p53-mediated antiviral response.

Title: miR-193b represses influenza A virus infection by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signalling.
Abstract: Due to an increasing emergence of new and drug-resistant strains of the influenza A virus (IAV), developing novel measures to combat influenza is necessary. We have previously shown that inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway reduces IAV infection. In this study, we aimed to identify antiviral human microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Using a miRNA expression library, we identified 85 miRNAs that up-regulated and 20 miRNAs that down-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Fifteen miRNAs were validated to up-regulate and five miRNAs to down-regulate the pathway. Overexpression of four selected miRNAs (miR-193b, miR-548f-1, miR-1-1, and miR-509-1) that down-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway reduced viral mRNA, protein levels in A/PR/8/34-infected HEK293 cells, and progeny virus production. Overexpression of miR-193b in lung epithelial A549 cells also resulted in decreases of A/PR/8/34 infection. Furthermore, miR-193b inhibited the replication of various strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/33, A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and H3N2 (A/Oklahoma/309/2006), as determined by a viral reporter luciferase assay. Further studies revealed that β-catenin was a target of miR-193b, and β-catenin rescued miR-193b-mediated suppression of IAV infection. miR-193b induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and delayed vRNP nuclear import. Finally, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of miR-193b to the lung reduced viral load in mice challenged by a sublethal dose of A/PR/8/34. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-193b represses IAV infection by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signalling.

Title: Friend or Foe: The Role of the Cytoskeleton in Influenza A Virus Assembly.
Abstract: Influenza A Virus (IAV) is a respiratory virus that causes seasonal outbreaks annually and pandemics occasionally. The main targets of the virus are epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. Like many other viruses, IAV employs the host cell's machinery to enter cells, synthesize new genomes and viral proteins, and assemble new virus particles. The cytoskeletal system is a major cellular machinery, which IAV exploits for its entry to and exit from the cell. However, in some cases, the cytoskeleton has a negative impact on efficient IAV growth. In this review, we highlight the role of cytoskeletal elements in cellular processes that are utilized by IAV in the host cell. We further provide an in-depth summary of the current literature on the roles the cytoskeleton plays in regulating specific steps during the assembly of progeny IAV particles.

Title: SREBP-dependent lipidomic reprogramming as a broad-spectrum antiviral target.
Abstract: Viruses are obligate intracellular microbes that exploit the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic demands, making these host pathways potential therapeutic targets. Here, by exploring a lipid library, we show that AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-α agonist, is highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza A virus. Using click chemistry, the overexpressed sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is shown to interact with AM580, which accounts for its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Mechanistic studies pinpoint multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways, including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, that are indispensable for virus replication. Collectively, our study identifies a basic lipogenic transactivation event with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as a potential target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.

Abstract: We investigated the circulation patterns of human influenza A and B viruses in Myanmar between 2010 and 2015 by analyzing full HA genes. Upper respiratory tract specimens were collected from patients with symptoms of influenza-like illness. A total of 2,860 respiratory samples were screened by influenza rapid diagnostic test, of which 1,577 (55.1%) and 810 (28.3%) were positive for influenza A and B, respectively. Of the 1,010 specimens that were positive for virus isolation, 370 (36.6%) were A(H1N1)pdm09, 327 (32.4%) were A(H3N2), 130 (12.9%) B(Victoria), and 183 (18.1%) were B(Yamagata) viruses. Our data showed that influenza epidemics mainly occurred during the rainy season in Myanmar. Our three study sites, Yangon, Pyinmana, and Pyin Oo Lwin had similar seasonality and circulating type and subtype of influenza in a given year. Moreover, viruses circulating in Myanmar during the study period were closely related genetically to those detected in Thailand, India, and China. Phylogeographic analysis showed that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar originated from Europe and migrated to other countries via Japan. Similarly, A(H3N2) viruses in Myanmar originated from Europe, and disseminated to the various countries via Australia. In addition, Myanmar plays a key role in reseeding of influenza B viruses to Southeast Asia and East Asia as well as Europe and Africa. Thus, we concluded that influenza virus in Myanmar has a strong link to neighboring Asian countries, Europe and Oceania.
Relevant: False
Reason: Phylogeographic analysis of influenza viruses, focusing on virus circulation and migration patterns without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Why Are CD8 T Cell Epitopes of Human Influenza A Virus Conserved?
Abstract: The high degree of conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes of influenza A virus (IAV) may allow for the development of T cell-inducing vaccines that provide protection across different strains and subtypes. This conservation is not fully explained by functional constraint, since an additional mutation(s) can compensate for the replicative fitness loss of IAV escape variants. Here, we propose three additional mechanisms that contribute to the conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes of IAV. First, influenza-specific CD8 T cells may protect predominantly against severe pathology rather than infection and may have only a modest effect on transmission. Second, polymorphism of the human major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) gene restricts the advantage of an escape variant to only a small fraction of the human population who carry the relevant MHC-I alleles. Finally, infection with CD8 T cell escape variants may result in a compensatory increase in the responses to other epitopes of IAV. We use a combination of population genetics and epidemiological models to examine how the interplay between these mechanisms affects the rate of invasion of IAV escape variants. We conclude that for a wide range of biologically reasonable parameters, the invasion of an escape variant virus will be slow, with a timescale of a decade or more. The results suggest T cell-inducing vaccines do not engender the rapid evolution of IAV. Finally, we identify key parameters whose measurement will allow for more accurate quantification of the long-term effectiveness and impact of universal T cell-inducing influenza vaccines.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Universal influenza vaccines against the conserved epitopes of influenza A virus have been proposed to minimize the burden of seasonal outbreaks and prepare for the pandemics. However, it is not clear how rapidly T cell-inducing vaccines will select for viruses that escape these T cell responses. Our mathematical models explore the factors that contribute to the conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes and how rapidly the virus will evolve in response to T cell-inducing vaccines. We identify the key biological parameters to be measured and questions that need to be addressed in future studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: Mathematical modeling of conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes and viral evolution, no direct experimental viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Unique Transcriptional Architecture in Airway Epithelial Cells and Macrophages Shapes Distinct Responses following Influenza Virus Infection <i>Ex Vivo</i>.
Abstract: Airway epithelial cells and macrophages differ markedly in their responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. To investigate transcriptional responses underlying these differences, purified subsets of type II airway epithelial cells (ATII) and alveolar macrophages (AM) recovered from the lungs of mock- or IAV-infected mice at 9 h postinfection were subjected to RNA sequencing. This time point was chosen to allow for characterization of cell types first infected with the virus inoculum, prior to multicycle virus replication and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways. In the absence of infection, AM predominantly expressed genes related to immunity, whereas ATII expressed genes consistent with their physiological roles in the lung. Following IAV infection, AM almost exclusively activated cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways that were dependent on interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) and/or type I IFN signaling. In contrast, IAV-infected ATII activated a broader range of physiological responses, including cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways, which were both independent of and dependent on IRF3/7 and/or type I IFN. These data suggest that transcriptional profiles hardwired during development are a major determinant underlying the different responses of ATII and AM to IAV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Airway epithelial cells (AEC) and airway macrophages (AM) represent major targets of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in the lung, yet the two cell types respond very differently to IAV infection. We have used RNA sequencing to define the host transcriptional responses in each cell type under steady-state conditions as well as following IAV infection. To do this, different cell subsets isolated from the lungs of mock- and IAV-infected mice were subjected to RNA sequencing. Under steady-state conditions, AM and AEC express distinct transcriptional activities, consistent with distinct physiological roles in the airways. Not surprisingly, these cells also exhibited major differences in transcriptional responses following IAV infection. These studies shed light on how the different transcriptional architectures of airway cells from two different lineages drive transcriptional responses to IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Compares transcriptional responses of host cells to influenza infection, no explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Real-time dissection of dynamic uncoating of individual influenza viruses.
Abstract: Uncoating is an obligatory step in the virus life cycle that serves as an antiviral target. Unfortunately, it is challenging to study viral uncoating due to methodology limitations for detecting this transient and dynamic event. The uncoating of influenza A virus (IAV), which contains an unusual genome of eight segmented RNAs, is particularly poorly understood. Here, by encapsulating quantum dot (QD)-conjugated viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) within infectious IAV virions and applying single-particle imaging, we tracked the uncoating process of individual IAV virions. Approximately 30% of IAV particles were found to undergo uncoating through fusion with late endosomes in the "around-nucleus" region at 30 to 90 minutes postinfection. Inhibition of viral M2 proton channels and cellular endosome acidification prevented IAV uncoating. IAV vRNPs are released separately into the cytosol after virus uncoating. Then, individual vRNPs undergo a three-stage movement to the cell nucleus and display two diffusion patterns when inside the nucleus. These findings reveal IAV uncoating and vRNP trafficking mechanisms, filling a critical gap in knowledge about influenza viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Studies viral uncoating and trafficking mechanisms, no explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Downregulation of miR-146a inhibits influenza A virus replication by enhancing the type I interferon response in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Albeit microRNAs (miRNAs) have become increasingly appreciated for their essential roles in innate immune responses to viral infections; however, it is unknown how host miRNAs regulate influenza A virus (IAV)-induced inflammation. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of miR-146a in IAV replication in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found miR-146a was significantly upregulated in A549 cells with IAV infection. Overexpression of miR-146a promoted IAV replication, while downregulation of miR-146a repressed replication. We found that miR-146a diminished type I interferon (IFN) responses by decreasing IFN-β production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Furthermore, we found the IFNs level and IAV replication regulated by miR-146a inhibitor was partially reversed by depletion of interferon receptor (IFNAR) 1 or 2. In addition, we found that miR-146a directly targets tumor necrosis factor receptor association factor 6 (TRAF6), which is involved in the production of type I IFN, and TRAF6 overexpression reversed the replication-promoting effect of miR-146a on IAV. In vivo, inhibition of miR-146a alleviated IAV-induced mice lung injury and promoted survival rates by promoting type I antiviral activities. It is, therefore, concluded that downregulation of miR-146a inhibits IAV replication by enhancing type I IFN response through its target gene TRAF6 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting miR-146a antagomir might be a potential therapeutic target during IAV infection.
Relevant: False

Title: Inhibition of Ongoing Influenza A Virus Replication Reveals Different Mechanisms of RIG-I Activation.
Abstract: Pattern recognition receptors provide essential nonself immune surveillance within distinct cellular compartments. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is one of the primary cytosolic RNA sensors, with an emerging role in the nucleus. It is involved in the spatiotemporal sensing of influenza A virus (IAV) replication, leading to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Nonetheless, the physiological viral ligands activating RIG-I during IAV infection remain underexplored. Other than full-length viral genomes, cellular constraints that impede ongoing viral replication likely potentiate an erroneous viral polymerase generating aberrant viral RNA species with RIG-I-activating potential. Here, we investigate the origins of RIG-I-activating viral RNA under two such constraints. Using chemical inhibitors that inhibit continuous viral protein synthesis, we identify the incoming, but not <i>de novo</i>-synthesized, viral defective interfering (DI) genomes contributing to RIG-I activation. In comparison, deprivation of viral nucleoprotein (NP), the key RNA chain elongation factor for the viral polymerase, leads to the production of aberrant viral RNA species activating RIG-I; however, their nature is likely to be distinct from that of DI RNA. Moreover, RIG-I activation in response to NP deprivation is not adversely affected by expression of the nuclear export protein (NEP), which diminishes the generation of a major subset of aberrant viral RNA but facilitates the accumulation of small viral RNA (svRNA). Overall, our results indicate the existence of fundamentally different mechanisms of RIG-I activation under cellular constraints that impede ongoing IAV replication.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The induction of an IFN response by IAV is mainly mediated by the RNA sensor RIG-I. The physiological RIG-I ligands produced during IAV infection are not fully elucidated. Cellular constraints leading to the inhibition of ongoing viral replication likely potentiate an erroneous viral polymerase producing aberrant viral RNA species activating RIG-I. Here, we demonstrate that RIG-I activation during chemical inhibition of continuous viral protein synthesis is attributable to the incoming DI genomes. Erroneous viral replication driven by NP deprivation promotes the generation of RIG-I-activating aberrant viral RNA, but their nature is likely to be distinct from that of DI RNA. Our results thus reveal distinct mechanisms of RIG-I activation by IAV under cellular constraints impeding ongoing viral replication. A better understanding of RIG-I sensing of IAV infection provides insight into the development of novel interventions to combat influenza virus infection.

Reason: Investigates mechanisms of RIG-I activation by influenza virus RNA species, focusing on host immune sensing rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Development and evaluation of a new real-time RT-PCR assay for detecting the latest H9N2 influenza viruses capable of causing human infection.
Abstract: The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) has spread among domestic poultry and wild birds worldwide. H9N2 AIV is sporadically transmitted to humans from avian species. A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed cases of non-fatal human infection with the Eurasian Y280 and G1 lineages have been reported in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh and Egypt since 1997. H9N2 AIV infections in poultry have become endemic in Asia and the Middle East and are a major source of viral internal genes for other AIV subtypes, such that continuous monitoring of H9N2 AIV is recommended. In this study, a new, one-step, real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to detect two major Eurasian H9 lineages of AIV capable of causing human infection. The sensitivity of this assay was determined using in vitro-transcribed RNA, and the detection limit was approximately 3 copies/reaction. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed against RNA from H1-15 subtypes of influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses and other viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, this assay could detect the H9 hemagglutinin (HA) gene from artificially reconstituted clinical samples spiked with H9N2 virus without any non-specific reactions. Therefore, this assay is highly sensitive and specific for H9 HA detection. The assay is useful both for diagnostic purposes in cases of suspected human infection with influenza H9N2 viruses and for the surveillance of both avian and human influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on developing and evaluating a diagnostic RT-PCR assay for detecting H9N2 influenza viruses, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: BST2 inhibits infection of influenza A virus by promoting apoptosis of infected cells.
Abstract: BST2 is an antiviral factor that inhibits the release of enveloped virus at the plasma membrane via an unusual topology in which its N-terminal is in the cytosol while its C-terminal is anchored by glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI). BST2-deficient cells showed substantially higher release of virions than wild type cells. Influenza-infected BST2-deficient cells showed greatly reduced cytopathic effect (CPE) than wild type cells despite their generally robust virus production. This finding prompted us to determine whether BST2 was involved in the apoptotic process of virus-infected host cells. Our results revealed that BST2 might be involved in IRE1α-mediated ER stress pathway by increasing spliced form XBP-1. Consequently, levels of cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP as representative molecules of apoptosis were significantly increased in wild type cells than those in BST2-deficient cells. These results suggest that BST2 might participate in innate host defense by augmenting ER-stress-induced apoptotic signaling to inhibit the replication and spread of virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the role of host protein BST2 in inhibiting influenza virus infection via apoptosis, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Pre-exposure with influenza A virus A/WSN/1933(H1N1) resulted in viral shedding reduction from pigs challenged with either swine H1N1 or H3N2 virus.
Abstract: There is an urgent need to develop a broad-spectrum vaccine that can effectively prevent or eliminate the spread of co-circulating swine influenza virus strains in multiple lineages or subtypes. We describe here that pre-exposure with a live virus generated via a A/WSN/1933(H1N1) reverse genetics system resulted in a significant reduction of viral shedding from pigs exposed to either a swine H1N1 virus or a swine H3N2 virus. At 3-day post challenge (DPC), approximately 1 log and 1.5 logs reductions of viral shedding were observed in the swine H1N1- and H3N2-challenged vaccinated pigs when compared to unvaccinated animals. A further decline in viral load was observed at 5 DPC where viral shedding was decreased by greater than 3 logs in vaccinated pigs receiving either the H1N1 or H3N2 virus challenge. Although the sera of the vaccinated pigs contained high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine strain, measured by Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay, only suboptimal HI titers of neutralizing antibody were detected in the post-challenge serum of the vaccinated animals using the challenge swine H1N1 virus. The substantial genetic and antigenic differences between the vaccine virus and the challenge viruses imply that the observed protection may be mediated by mechanisms other than neutralization by IgG, such as non-neutralizing antibody activities, mucosal immunity, or conserved T cell immunity, which warrants further investigation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines the effect of pre-exposure to a live virus on viral shedding and immunity in pigs, focusing on immune response and protection rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: heme oxygenase-1 agonist CoPP suppresses influenza virus replication through IRF3-mediated generation of IFN-α/β.
Abstract: The innate immunity plays an essential role in defending infection of Influenza A virus (IAV). The regulatory effect of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective enzyme, on innate immunity has been revealed. In this study, we aim to confirm the antiviral effect of CoPP (Cobaltic Protoporphyrin IX Chloride), a potent HO-1 inducer on IAV infection and elucidate the possible mechanism of HO-1-mediated host innate immune responses. Our results show that CoPP exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activities against IAV. Furthermore, CoPP attenuates IAV replication through inducing type I IFNs response, not depending on HO-1 enzymatic activity. We also provide direct evidence that HO-1-mediated type I IFN response activation is largely due to its interaction with IRF3, which then promotes IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These results suggest that HO-1 agonist CoPP suppresses IAV replication through IRF3-mediated generation of IFN-α/β. Thus, therapeutic induction of HO-1 might be a promising strategy to combat IAV epidemics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral effect of a host enzyme inducer (CoPP) on influenza virus replication via host innate immune pathways, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Chenodeoxycholic Acid from Bile Inhibits Influenza A Virus Replication via Blocking Nuclear Export of Viral Ribonucleoprotein Complexes.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is still a major global threat for humans, especially for the risk groups: young children and the elderly. The currently licensed antiviral drugs target viral factors and are prone to viral resistance. In recent years, a few endogenous small molecules from host, such as estradiol and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediator protection D1 (PD1), were demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting IAV infection. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the main primary bile acids, is synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and classically functions in emulsification and absorption of dietary fats. Clinically, CDCA has been used in the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones for more than five decades. In this study, we showed that CDCA attenuated the replication of three subtypes of influenza A virus, including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in A549 and MDCK cell cultures with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 5.5 to 11.5 μM. Mechanistically, CDCA effectively restrained the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. In conclusion, as an endogenous physiological small molecule, CDCA can inhibit IAV replication in vitro, at least in part, by blocking vRNP nuclear export, and affords further studies for development as a potential antiviral agent against IAV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on influenza virus replication via blocking nuclear export of viral complexes, focusing on host-targeted mechanisms rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Immunodominance and Antigenic Variation of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin: Implications for Design of Universal Vaccine Immunogens.
Abstract: Influenza viruses routinely acquire mutations in their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins that abrogate binding of pre-existing antibodies in a process known as antigenic drift. Most human antibodies against HA and NA are directed against epitopes that are hypervariable and not against epitopes that are conserved among different influenza virus strains. Universal influenza vaccines are currently being developed to elicit protective responses against functionally conserved sites on influenza proteins where viral escape mutations can result in large fitness costs [1]. Universal vaccine targets include the highly conserved HA stem domain [2-12], the less conserved HA receptor-binding site (RBS) [13-16], as well as conserved sites on NA [17-19]. One central challenge of universal vaccine efforts is to steer human antibody responses away from immunodominant, variable epitopes and towards subdominant, functionally conserved sites. Overcoming this challenge will require further understanding of the structural basis of broadly neutralizing HA and NA antibody binding epitopes and factors that influence immunodominance hierarchies of human antibody responses.

Title: Monoclonal antibody against human Tim-3 enhances antiviral immune response.
Abstract: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim-3) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor in T cells and innate immune cells. The deregulated upregulation of Tim-3 is related to immune exhaustion in tumour and viral infection. To overcome Tim-3-mediated immune tolerance, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody against human Tim-3 (L3G) and investigated its roles in inhibiting Tim-3 signalling and overcoming immune tolerance in T cells and monocytes/macrophages. The administration of L3G to cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) significantly increased the production of IFN-γ and IL-2 and the expression of type I interferon. The administration of L3G also increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-8 and type I interferon in U937 cells and primary monocytes. We investigated the mechanisms by which L3G enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and our data show that L3G enhances STAT1 phosphorylation in both monocytes/macrophages and T cells. Finally, in an H1N1 infection model of PBMCs and U937 cells, L3G decreased the viral load and enhanced the expression of interferon. Thus, we developed a functional antibody with therapeutic potential against Tim-3-mediated infection tolerance.
Relevant: False

Title: Activity of enisamium, an isonicotinic acid derivative, against influenza viruses in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells.
Abstract: New therapeutics for the control of influenza virus infections are needed to alleviate the burden caused by seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, and to overcome the potential risk of drug-resistance emergence. Enisamium iodide (Amizon®, Farmak) is currently approved for clinical use for the treatment of influenza in 11 countries which includes Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. However, experimental evidence of the antiviral activity of enisamium has not been reported. Antiviral activity of enisamium was assessed by virus yield reduction assays using differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Permeability of enisamium into differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells and its cytotoxicity were also assessed, and comparisons with other cell lines were made. Enisamium inhibited replication of multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses, including seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2, the zoonotic H5N1 and H7N9, neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant variant carrying the H275Y NA substitution (N1 numbering), and influenza B virus at doses 23- to 64-fold lower than cytotoxic concentrations. The permeability of enisamium in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (where no antiviral activity was found) was less than 0.08%, while higher permeability was observed in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (1.9%). The kinetics of enisamium intracellular uptake in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells was concentration dependent. In time-of-addition experiments in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells, enisamium treatment within 4 h after A(H1N1) virus inoculation resulted in 100-fold or greater reductions in virus titers, suggesting that it affects an early stage of the virus life cycle. Enisamium exhibits antiviral activity against influenza viruses in vitro, supporting the reported clinical efficacy against influenza virus infections.

Title: Efficient Inhibition of Avian and Seasonal Influenza A Viruses by a Virus-Specific Dicer-Substrate Small Interfering RNA Swarm in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are viral pathogens that cause epidemics and occasional pandemics of significant mortality. The generation of efficacious vaccines and antiviral drugs remains a challenge due to the rapid appearance of new influenza virus types and antigenic variants. Consequently, novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infections are needed, given the limitations of the presently available antivirals. Here, we used enzymatically produced IAV-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules and <i>Giardia intestinalis</i> Dicer for the generation of a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. The siRNAs target multiple conserved genomic regions of the IAVs. In mammalian cells, the produced 25- to 27-nucleotide-long siRNA molecules are processed by endogenous Dicer into 21-nucleotide siRNAs and are thus designated Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs). We evaluated the efficacy of the above DsiRNA swarm at preventing IAV infections in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The replication of different IAV strains, including avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, was significantly inhibited by pretransfection of the cells with the IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm. Up to 7 orders of magnitude inhibition of viral RNA expression was observed, which led to a dramatic inhibition of IAV protein synthesis and virus production. The IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm inhibited virus replication directly through the RNA interference pathway although a weak induction of innate interferon responses was detected. Our results provide direct evidence for the feasibility of the siRNA strategy and the potency of DsiRNA swarms in the prevention and treatment of influenza, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In spite of the enormous amount of research, influenza virus is still one of the major challenges for medical virology due to its capacity to generate new variants, which potentially lead to severe epidemics and pandemics. We demonstrated here that a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, including more than 100 different antiviral RNA molecules targeting the most conserved regions of the influenza A virus genome, could efficiently inhibit the replication of all tested avian and seasonal influenza A variants in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The wide antiviral spectrum makes the virus-specific siRNA swarm a potentially efficient treatment modality against both avian and seasonal influenza viruses.

Title: Comparison of 2016-17 and Previous Epizootics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 Guangdong Lineage in Europe.
Abstract: We analyzed the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 epizootic of 2016-17 in Europe by epidemiologic and genetic characteristics and compared it with 2 previous epizootics caused by the same H5 Guangdong lineage. The 2016-17 epizootic was the largest in Europe by number of countries and farms affected and greatest diversity of wild birds infected. We observed significant differences among the 3 epizootics regarding region affected, epidemic curve, seasonality, and outbreak duration, making it difficult to predict future HPAI epizootics. However, we know that in 2005-06 and 2016-17 the initial peak of wild bird detections preceded the peak of poultry outbreaks within Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of 2016-17 viruses indicates 2 main pathways into Europe. Our findings highlight the need for global surveillance of viral changes to inform disease preparedness, detection, and control.

Title: Insight into Influenza: A Virus Cap-Snatching.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA segments. Each segment is associated with a protein complex, with the 3' and 5' ends bound to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the remainder associated with the viral nucleoprotein. During transcription of viral mRNA, this ribonucleoprotein complex steals short, 5'-capped transcripts produced by the cellular DNA dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and uses them to prime transcription of viral mRNA. Here, we review the current knowledge on the process of IAV cap-snatching and suggest a requirement for RNAPII promoter-proximal pausing for efficient IAV mRNA transcription.

Title: A Fréchet tree distance measure to compare phylogeographic spread paths across trees.
Abstract: Phylogeographic methods reconstruct the origin and spread of taxa by inferring locations for internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree from sampling locations of genetic sequences. This is commonly applied to study pathogen outbreaks and spread. To evaluate such reconstructions, the inferred spread paths from root to leaf nodes should be compared to other methods or references. Usually, ancestral state reconstructions are evaluated by node-wise comparisons, therefore requiring the same tree topology, which is usually unknown. Here, we present a method for comparing phylogeographies across different trees inferred from the same taxa. We compare paths of locations by calculating discrete Fréchet distances. By correcting the distances by the number of paths going through a node, we define the Fréchet tree distance as a distance measure between phylogeographies. As an application, we compare phylogeographic spread patterns on trees inferred with different methods from hemagglutinin sequences of H5N1 influenza viruses, finding that both tree inference and ancestral reconstruction cause variation in phylogeographic spread that is not directly reflected by topological differences. The method is suitable for comparing phylogeographies inferred with different tree or phylogeographic inference methods to each other or to a known ground truth, thus enabling a quality assessment of such techniques.

Reason: The paper focuses on a method to compare phylogeographic spread paths across trees and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: SilentMutations (SIM): A tool for analyzing long-range RNA-RNA interactions in viral genomes and structured RNAs.
Abstract: A single nucleotide change in the coding region can alter the amino acid sequence of a protein. In consequence, natural or artificial sequence changes in viral RNAs may have various effects not only on protein stability, function and structure but also on viral replication. In recent decades, several tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations in structured RNAs such as viral genomes or non-coding RNAs. Some tools use multiple point mutations and also take coding regions into account. However, none of these tools was designed to specifically simulate the effect of mutations on viral long-range interactions. Here, we developed SilentMutations (SIM), an easy-to-use tool to analyze the effect of multiple point mutations on the secondary structures of two interacting viral RNAs. The tool can simulate disruptive and compensatory mutants of two interacting single-stranded RNAs. This allows a fast and accurate assessment of key regions potentially involved in functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions and will eventually help virologists and RNA-experts to design appropriate experiments. SIM only requires two interacting single-stranded RNA regions as input. The output is a plain text file containing the most promising mutants and a graphical representation of all interactions. We applied our tool on two experimentally validated influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus interactions and we were able to predict potential double mutants for in vitro validation experiments. The source code and documentation of SIM are freely available at github.com/desiro/silentMutations.

Title: Nucleolar Relocalization of RBM14 by Influenza A Virus NS1 Protein.
Abstract: Viruses utilize a number of host factors in order to carry out their replication cycles. Influenza A virus (IAV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both infect the tissues of the respiratory tract, and as such we hypothesize that they might require similar host factors. Several published genome-wide screens have identified putative IAV host factors; however, there is significant discordance between their hits. In order to build on this work, we integrated a variety of "OMICS" data sources using two complementary network analyses, yielding 51 genes enriched for both IAV and RSV replication. We designed a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based assay to screen these genes against IAV under robust conditions and identified 13 genes supported by two IAV subtypes in both primary and transformed human lung cells. One of these hits, RNA binding motif 14 (RBM14), was validated as a required host factor and furthermore was shown to relocalize to the nucleolus upon IAV infection but not with other viruses. Additionally, the IAV NS1 protein is both necessary and sufficient for RBM14 relocalization, and relocalization also requires the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding capacity of NS1. This work reports the discovery of a new host requirement for IAV replication and exposes a novel example of interplay between IAV NS1 and the host protein, RBM14.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) present major global disease burdens. There are high economic costs associated with morbidity as well as significant mortality rates, especially in developing countries, in children, and in the elderly. There are currently limited therapeutic options for these viruses, which underscores the need for novel research into virus biology that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. This work extends existing research into host factors involved in virus replication and explores the interaction between IAV and one such host factor, RBM14. Further study to fully characterize this interaction may elucidate novel mechanisms used by the virus during its replication cycle and open new avenues for understanding virus biology.

Title: Causes and Consequences of Spatial Within-Host Viral Spread.
Abstract: The spread of viral pathogens both between and within hosts is inherently a spatial process. While the spatial aspects of viral spread at the epidemiological level have been increasingly well characterized, the spatial aspects of viral spread within infected hosts are still understudied. Here, with a focus on influenza A viruses (IAVs), we first review experimental studies that have shed light on the mechanisms and spatial dynamics of viral spread within hosts. These studies provide strong empirical evidence for highly localized IAV spread within hosts. Since mathematical and computational within-host models have been increasingly used to gain a quantitative understanding of observed viral dynamic patterns, we then review the (relatively few) computational modeling studies that have shed light on possible factors that structure the dynamics of spatial within-host IAV spread. These factors include the dispersal distance of virions, the localization of the immune response, and heterogeneity in host cell phenotypes across the respiratory tract. While informative, we find in these studies a striking absence of theoretical expectations of how spatial dynamics may impact the dynamics of viral populations. To mitigate this, we turn to the extensive ecological and evolutionary literature on range expansions to provide informed theoretical expectations. We find that factors such as the type of density dependence, the frequency of long-distance dispersal, specific life history characteristics, and the extent of spatial heterogeneity are critical factors affecting the speed of population spread and the genetic composition of spatially expanding populations. For each factor that we identified in the theoretical literature, we draw parallels to its analog in viral populations. We end by discussing current knowledge gaps related to the spatial component of within-host IAV spread and the potential for within-host spatial considerations to inform the development of disease control strategies.

Title: Human CCR5Δ32 (rs333) polymorphism has no influence on severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Brazilian patients from the post pandemic period.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute and highly contagious viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality. The identification of host genetic factors associated with susceptibility and severity of influenza virus infection is of paramount importance. Previous studies evaluating the potential involvement of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism (rs333), a 32 base pair deletion in CC motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene, in severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected individuals have been reported, but their results are quite conflicting. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the CCR5Δ32 frequency in individuals with mild, severe and fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and its putative association with clinical and epidemiologic data. A total of 432 individuals were included in this study and classified according to their clinical status, into the following groups: influenza like illness (ILI) (n = 153); severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (n = 173) and fatal (n = 106) cases. The samples were collected in the post pandemic period, from 2012 to 2018. Individuals were further stratified according to their clinical and epidemiological data. The CCR5Δ32 variant was genotyped by PCR amplification and a subset of samples was further submitted to Sanger sequencing. The different clinical groups (ILI, SARI and fatal) presented similar distribution of wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and CCR5Δ32 allele frequencies. Genotype Δ32/Δ32 was not detected in our study. Additionally, no association between wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and dyspnea, a clinical factor for influenza complications was found. Similarly, no significant differences in the distribution of wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and CCR5Δ32 variant allele frequencies were observed in samples from the different Brazilian geographical regions. The CCR5Δ32 variant does not influence the susceptibility to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 severe disease or mortality in individuals from Brazil.

Title: ISU FLUture: a veterinary diagnostic laboratory web-based platform to monitor the temporal genetic patterns of Influenza A virus in swine.
Abstract: Influenza A Virus (IAV) causes respiratory disease in swine and is a zoonotic pathogen. Uncontrolled IAV in swine herds not only affects animal health, it also impacts production through increased costs associated with treatment and prevention efforts. The Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) diagnoses influenza respiratory disease in swine and provides epidemiological analyses on samples submitted by veterinarians. To assess the incidence of IAV in swine and inform stakeholders, the ISU FLUture website was developed as an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration of the ISU VDL swine IAV aggregate data in the clinical diagnostic database. The information associated with diagnostic cases has varying levels of completeness and is anonymous, but minimally contains: sample collection date, specimen type, and IAV subtype. Many IAV positive samples are sequenced, and in these cases, the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence and genetic classification are completed. These data are collected and presented on ISU FLUture in near real-time, and more than 6,000 IAV positive diagnostic cases and their epidemiological and evolutionary information since 2003 are presented to date. The database and web interface provides rapid and unique insight into the trends of IAV derived from both large- and small-scale swine farms across the United States of America. ISU FLUture provides a suite of web-based tools to allow stakeholders to search for trends and correlations in IAV case metadata in swine from the ISU VDL. Since the database infrastructure is updated in near real-time and is integrated within a high-volume veterinary diagnostic laboratory, earlier detection is now possible for emerging IAV in swine that subsequently cause vaccination and control challenges. The access to real-time swine IAV data provides a link with the national USDA swine IAV surveillance system and allows veterinarians to make objective decisions regarding the management and control of IAV in swine. The website is publicly accessible at http://influenza.cvm.iastate.edu .

Title: Virus-virus interactions and host ecology are associated with RNA virome structure in wild birds.
Abstract: Little is known about the factors that shape the ecology of RNA viruses in nature. Wild birds are an important case in point, as other than influenza A virus, avian samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA-sequencing ("meta-transcriptomics"), we revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of the ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. The viruses identified included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. Additionally, we identified novel virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked Avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from Australia's arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, May 20-October 13, 2018.
Abstract: During May 20-October 13, 2018,* low levels of influenza activity were reported in the United States, with a mix of influenza A and B viruses circulating. Seasonal influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere was low overall, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in many regions. Antigenic testing of available influenza A and B viruses indicated that no significant antigenic drift in circulating viruses had emerged. In late September, the components for the 2019 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine were selected and included an incremental update to the A(H3N2) vaccine virus used in egg-based vaccine manufacturing; no change was recommended for the A(H3N2) component of cell-manufactured or recombinant influenza vaccines. Annual influenza vaccination is the best method for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should receive influenza vaccine, preferably before the onset of influenza circulation in their community, which often begins in October and peaks during December-February. Health care providers should offer vaccination by the end of October and should continue to recommend and administer influenza vaccine to previously unvaccinated patients throughout the 2018-19 influenza season (1). In addition, during May 20-October 13, a small number of nonhuman influenza "variant" virus infections<sup>†</sup> were reported in the United States; most were associated with exposure to swine. Although limited human-to-human transmission might have occurred in one instance, no ongoing community transmission was identified. Vulnerable populations, especially young children and other persons at high risk for serious influenza complications, should avoid swine barns at agricultural fairs, or close contact with swine.<sup>§</sup>.

Title: Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> Promotes Influenza Replication and Increases Virus Related Lung Damage via Activation of TLR4 Signaling.
Abstract: Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>), which alters immune responses to mammals, is one of the most common mycotoxins in feeds and food. Swine influenza virus (SIV) is a major pathogen of both animals and humans. However, there have been few studies about the relationship between AFB<sub>1</sub> exposure and SIV replication. Here, for the first time, we investigated the involvement of AFB<sub>1</sub> in SIV replication <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and explored the underlying mechanism using multiple cell lines and mouse models. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated that low concentrations of AFB<sub>1</sub> (0.01-0.25 μg/ml) markedly promoted SIV replication as revealed by increased viral titers and matrix protein (M) mRNA and nucleoprotein (NP) levels in MDCK cells, A549 cells and PAMs. <i>In vivo</i> studies showed that 10-40 μg/kg of AFB<sub>1</sub> exacerbated SIV infection in mice as illustrated by significantly higher lung virus titers, viral M mRNA levels, NP levels, lung indexes and more severe lung damage. Further study showed that AFB<sub>1</sub> upregulated TLR4, but not other TLRs, in SIV-infected PAMs. Moreover, AFB<sub>1</sub> activated TLR4 signaling as demonstrated by the increases of phosphorylated NFκB p65 and TNF-α release in PAMs and mice. In contrast, TLR4 knockdown or the use of BAY 11-7082, a specific inhibitor of NFκB, blocked the AFB<sub>1</sub>-promoted SIV replication and inflammatory responses in PAMs. Furthermore, a TLR4-specific antagonist, TAK242, and TLR4 knockout both attenuated the AFB<sub>1</sub>-promoted SIV replication, inflammation and lung damage in mice. We therefore conclude that AFB<sub>1</sub> exposure aggravates SIV replication, inflammation and lung damage by activating TLR4-NFκB signaling.

Title: Loss of T-bet confers survival advantage to influenza-bacterial superinfection.
Abstract: The transcription factor, T-bet, regulates type 1 inflammatory responses against a range of infections. Here, we demonstrate a previously unaddressed role of T-bet, to influenza virus and bacterial superinfection. Interestingly, we found that T-bet deficiency did not adversely affect the efficacy of viral clearance or recovery compared to wild-type hosts. Instead, increased infiltration of neutrophils and production of Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22), in lungs of influenza virus-infected T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice, were correlated with survival advantage against subsequent infection by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> Neutralization of IL-17, but not IL-22, in T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice increased pulmonary bacterial load, concomitant with decreased neutrophil infiltration and reduced survival of T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice. IL-17 production by CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and γδ T cell types was identified to contribute to this protection against bacterial superinfection. We further showed that neutrophil depletion in T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> lungs increased pulmonary bacterial burden. These results thus indicate that despite the loss of T-bet, immune defences required for influenza viral clearance are fully functional, which in turn enhances protective type 17 immune responses against lethal bacterial superinfections.

Title: Engineered Small-Molecule Control of Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a global health concern despite the availability of a seasonal vaccine. It is difficult to predict which strains will circulate during influenza season, and therefore, it is extremely challenging to test novel vaccines in the human population. To overcome this obstacle, new vaccines must be tested in challenge studies. This approach poses significant safety problems, since current pharmacological interventions for IAV are poorly efficacious. New methods are needed to enhance the safety of these challenge studies. In this study, we have generated a virus expressing a small-molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh) tag as a safety switch for IAV replication. The addition of the SMASh tag to an essential IAV protein allows for small-molecule-mediated inhibition of replication. Treatment with this drug controls the replication of a SMASh-tagged virus <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> This model for restriction of viral replication has potential for broad applications in vaccine studies, virotherapy, and basic virus research.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality annually worldwide, despite the availability of new formulations of the vaccine each season. There is a critical need to develop more-efficacious vaccines. However, testing novel vaccines in the human population in controlled studies is difficult due to the limited availability and efficacy of intervention strategies should the vaccine fail. There are also significant safety concerns for work with highly pathogenic IAV strains in the laboratory. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to improve the safety of vaccine studies and of research on highly pathogenic IAV. In this study, we developed an IAV strain engineered to contain a small-molecule-mediated safety switch. This tag, when attached to an essential viral protein, allows for the regulation of IAV replication <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> This strategy provides a platform for the regulation of virus replication without targeting viral proteins directly.

Title: Chickens Expressing IFIT5 Ameliorate Clinical Outcome and Pathology of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and Velogenic Newcastle Disease Viruses.
Abstract: Innate antiviral immunity establishes first line of defense against invading pathogens through sensing their molecular structures such as viral RNA. This antiviral potential of innate immunity is mainly attributed to a myriad of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Amongst well-characterized ISGs, we have previously shown that antiviral potential of chicken IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptides repeats 5 (chIFIT5) is determined by its interaction potential with 5'ppp containing viral RNA. Here, we generated transgenic chickens using avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (RCAS)-based gene transfer system that constitutively and stably express chIFIT5. The transgenic chickens infected with clinical dose (EID<sub>50</sub> 10<sup>4</sup> for HPAIV and 10<sup>5</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> for vNDV) of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV; H5N1) or velogenic strain of Newcastle disease virus (vNDV; Genotype VII) showed marked resistance against infections. While transgenic chickens failed to sustain a lethal dose of these viruses (EID<sub>50</sub> 10<sup>5</sup> for HPAIV and 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> for vNDV), a delayed and lower level of clinical disease and mortality, reduced virus shedding and tissue damage was observed compared to non-transgenic control chickens. These observations suggest that stable expression of chIFIT5 alone is potentially insufficient in providing sterile protection against these highly virulent viruses; however, it is sufficient to ameliorate the clinical outcome of these RNA viruses. These findings propose the potential of innate immune genes in conferring genetic resistance in chickens against highly pathogenic and zoonotic viral pathogens causing sever disease in both animals and humans.

Title: Epidemiology of circulating human influenza viruses from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2015.
Abstract: The establishment of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in Kinshasa, Bas Congo, Maniema, Katanga, and Kasai Provinces allowed generation of important data on the molecular epidemiology of human influenza viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, some challenges still exist, including the need for extending the influenza surveillance to more provinces. This study describes the pattern of influenza virus circulating in DRC during 2015. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from January to December 2015 from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and in all hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). Molecular analysis was done to determine influenza type and subtype at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Kinshasa using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of antiviral resistance by enzyme inhibition assay and nucleotide sequencing was performed by the Collaborating center in the USA (CDC, Atlanta). Out of 2,376 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients, 218 (9.1%) were positive for influenza virus. Among the positive samples, 149 were characterized as influenza virus type A (Flu A), 67 as type B (Flu B) and 2 mixed infections (Flu A and B). Flu A subtypes detected were H3N2 and H1N1. The Yamagata strain of Flu B was detected among patients in the country. Individuals aged between 5 and 14 years accounted for the largest age group affected by influenza virus. All influenza viruses detected were found to be sensitive to antiviral drugs such as oseltamivar, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivar. The present study documented the possible involvement of both circulation of Flu A and B viruses in human respiratory infection in certain DRC provinces during 2015. This study emphasises the need to extend the influenza surveillance to other provinces for a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in DRC. It is envisioned that such a system would lead to improved disease control and patient management.

Title: Treating Influenza Infection, From Now and Into the Future.
Abstract: Influenza viruses (IVs) are a continual threat to global health. The high mutation rate of the IV genome makes this virus incredibly successful, genetic drift allows for annual epidemics which result in thousands of deaths and millions of hospitalizations. Moreover, the emergence of new strains through genetic shift (e.g., swine-origin influenza A) can cause devastating global outbreaks of infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are currently used to treat IV infection and act directly on viral proteins to halt IV spread. However, effectivity is limited late in infection and drug resistance can develop. New therapies which target highly conserved features of IV such as antibodies to the stem region of hemagglutinin or the IV RNA polymerase inhibitor: Favipiravir are currently in clinical trials. Compared to NAIs, these treatments have a higher tolerance for resistance and a longer therapeutic window and therefore, may prove more effective. However, clinical and experimental evidence has demonstrated that it is not just viral spread, but also the host inflammatory response and damage to the lung epithelium which dictate the outcome of IV infection. Therapeutic regimens for IV infection should therefore also regulate the host inflammatory response and protect epithelial cells from unnecessary cell death. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as etanercept, statins or cyclooxygenase enzyme 2 inhibitors may temper IV induced inflammation, demonstrating the possibility of repurposing these drugs as single or adjunct therapies for IV infection. IV binds to sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface to initiate infection and productive IV replication is primarily restricted to airway epithelial cells. Accordingly, targeting therapies to the epithelium will directly inhibit IV spread while minimizing off target consequences, such as over activation of immune cells. The neuraminidase mimic Fludase cleaves sialic acid receptors from the epithelium to inhibit IV entry to cells. While type III interferons activate an antiviral gene program in epithelial cells with minimal perturbation to the IV specific immune response. This review discusses the above-mentioned candidate anti-IV therapeutics and others at the preclinical and clinical trial stage.

Title: Mathematical Analysis of Influenza A Dynamics in the Emergence of Drug Resistance.
Abstract: Every year, influenza causes high morbidity and mortality especially among the immunocompromised persons worldwide. The emergence of drug resistance has been a major challenge in curbing the spread of influenza. In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated and used to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza A virus having incorporated the aspect of drug resistance. The qualitative analysis of the model is given in terms of the control reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>c</sub>. The model equilibria are computed and stability analysis carried out. The model is found to exhibit backward bifurcation prompting the need to lower <i>R</i><sub>c</sub> to a critical value <i>R</i><sub>c</sub><sup><i>∗</i></sup> for effective disease control. Sensitivity analysis results reveal that vaccine efficacy is the parameter with the most control over the spread of influenza. Numerical simulations reveal that despite vaccination reducing the reproduction number below unity, influenza still persists in the population. Hence, it is essential, in addition to vaccination, to apply other strategies to curb the spread of influenza.

Title: Rapid Detection of Avian Influenza A Virus (H7N9) by Lateral Flow Dipstick Recombinase Polymerase Amplification.
Abstract: Avian influenza A (H7N9) virus has caused several epidemics and infection in both human and poultry. With mutation, the H7N9 virus gained its fifth endemic in China. Early diagnosis is crucial for the control of viral spread in poultry and prognosis of infected patients. In this study, we developed and evaluated a lateral flow dipstick recombinase polymerase amplification (LFD-RPA) assay for rapid detection of both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of H7N9. Our H7-LFD-RPA and N9-LFD-RPA assay were able to detect 32 fg H7N9 nucleic acid which is more convenient and rapid than previous methods. Through detecting 50 influenza positive samples, cross-reaction was not found with other subtypes of influenza virus. The 100% analytical specificity and sufficient analytical sensitivity results agreed the real time RT-PCR assay. The results data demonstrated that our method performed well and could be applied to the detection of H7N9 virus. This LFD-RPA assay provides a candidate method for rapid point-of-care diagnosis of H7N9.

Abstract: Eurasia highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5 clade 2.3.4.4 emerged in North America at the end of 2014 and caused outbreaks affecting >50 million poultry in the United States before eradication in June 2015. We investigated the underlying ecologic and epidemiologic processes associated with this viral spread by performing a comparative genomic study using 268 full-length genome sequences and data from outbreak investigations. Reassortant HPAIV H5N2 circulated in wild birds along the Pacific flyway before several spillover events transmitting the virus to poultry farms. Our analysis suggests that >3 separate introductions of HPAIV H5N2 into Midwest states occurred during March-June 2015; transmission to Midwest poultry farms from Pacific wild birds occurred ≈1.7-2.4 months before detection. Once established in poultry, the virus rapidly spread between turkey and chicken farms in neighboring states. Enhanced biosecurity is required to prevent the introduction and dissemination of HPAIV across the poultry industry.

Title: Optimization of cell-laden bioinks for 3D bioprinting and efficient infection with influenza A virus.
Abstract: Bioprinting is a new technology, which arranges cells with high spatial resolution, but its potential to create models for viral infection studies has not yet been fully realized. The present study describes the optimization of a bioink composition for extrusion printing. The bioinks were biophysically characterized by rheological and electron micrographic measurements. Hydrogels consisting of alginate, gelatin and Matrigel were used to provide a scaffold for a 3D arrangement of human alveolar A549 cells. A blend containing 20% Matrigel provided the optimal conditions for spatial distribution and viability of the printed cells. Infection of the 3D model with a seasonal influenza A strain resulted in widespread distribution of the virus and a clustered infection pattern that is also observed in the natural lung but not in two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, which demonstrates the advantage of 3D printed constructs over conventional culture conditions. The bioink supported viral replication and proinflammatory interferon release of the infected cells. We consider our strategy to be paradigmatic for the generation of humanized 3D tissue models by bioprinting to study infections and develop new antiviral strategies.

Title: Xin-Jia-Xiang-Ru-Yin alleviated H1N1-induced acute lung injury and inhibited the IFN-γ-related regulatory pathway in summer flu.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection caused by influenza virus, which is often prevalent in summer and winter. In contrast to the prevalent focus on winter flu, summer flu is often ignored by epidemiological researchers. However, summer flu should be studied because of the special immune status and the influenza spread mechanism in the hot and humid environment. Moreover, people are more likely to catch a summertime cold upon suddenly entering relatively cool air conditioning from the hot and humid environment. To simulate summer flu, we established a flu animal model under a high temperature and humidity environment during the day with a relatively low temperature at night to investigate the anti-influenza virus effect and mechanism of Xin-Jia-Xiang-Ru-Yin. The results of RT-qPCR verified virus replication, while pathological sections showed inflammation. The expression of the IFN-γ-related regulatory pathway was measured by PCR and immunohistochemistry. We concluded that Xin-Jia-Xiang-Ru-Yin, which combined antiviral therapy and immune modulation effects, might have important therapeutic benefits against summer flu.

Title: System for the heterologous expression of NS1 protein of H9N2 avian influenza virus in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila.
Abstract: Tetrahymena is commonly used as an alternative eukaryotic system for efficiently expressing heterologous genes. In this study, we inserted the non-structural (NS) 1 gene of avian influenza virus (AIV) into the shuttle vector pD5H8 and transformed conjugating T. thermophila with the recombinant plasmid pD5H8-NS1 by particle bombardment. Positive transformants were selected with paromomycin. We demonstrated that the NS1 protein could be expressed steadily following induction with cadmium in this Tetrahymena system. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection method was preliminary established using the expressed protein as coating antigens for serodiagnosis. This is the first study in which a Tetrahymena expression system was employed for the expression of the AIV NS1 protein, and it provides a good basis for the development of differential diagnostic kits and vaccines for the prevention and control of avian influenza.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences based on a novel k-mer natural vector method.
Abstract: Based on the k-mer model for protein sequence, a novel k-mer natural vector method is proposed to characterize the features of k-mers in a protein sequence, in which the numbers and distributions of k-mers are considered. It is proved that the relationship between a protein sequence and its k-mer natural vector is one-to-one. Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences therefore can be easily performed without requiring evolutionary models or human intervention. In addition, there exists no a criterion to choose a suitable k, and k has a great influence on obtaining results as well as computational complexity. In this paper, a compound k-mer natural vector is utilized to quantify each protein sequence.

Title: Host Shutoff in Influenza A Virus: Many Means to an End.
Abstract: Influenza A virus carries few of its own proteins, but uses them effectively to take control of the infected cells and avoid immune responses. Over the years, host shutoff, the widespread down-regulation of host gene expression, has emerged as a key process that contributes to cellular takeover in infected cells. Interestingly, multiple mechanisms of host shutoff have been described in influenza A virus, involving changes in translation, RNA synthesis and stability. Several viral proteins, notably the non-structural protein NS1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the endoribonuclease PA-X have been implicated in host shutoff. This multitude of host shutoff mechanisms indicates that host shutoff is an important component of the influenza A virus replication cycle. Here we review the various mechanisms of host shutoff in influenza A virus and the evidence that they contribute to immune evasion and/or viral replication. We also discuss what the purpose of having multiple mechanisms may be.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review discusses host shutoff mechanisms by viral proteins but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Distinct antiviral signatures revealed by the magnitude and round of influenza virus replication in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza virus has a broad cellular tropism in the respiratory tract. Infected epithelial cells sense the infection and initiate an antiviral response. To define the antiviral response at the earliest stages of infection we used a series of single-cycle reporter viruses. These viral probes demonstrated cells in vivo harbor a range in magnitude of virus replication. Transcriptional profiling of cells supporting different levels of replication revealed tiers of IFN-stimulated gene expression. Uninfected cells and cells with blunted replication expressed a distinct and potentially protective antiviral signature, while cells with high replication expressed a unique reserve set of antiviral genes. Finally, we used these single-cycle reporter viruses to determine the antiviral landscape during virus spread, which unveiled disparate protection of epithelial cell subsets mediated by IFN in vivo. Together these results highlight the complexity of virus-host interactions within the infected lung and suggest that magnitude and round of replication tune the antiviral response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes antiviral responses to different levels of viral replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic characteristics of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from free-range poultry in Eastern China, in 2014-2015.
Abstract: Circulating H7N9 influenza viruses in live poultry markets continue to pose a threat to human health. Free-range poultry, one of the sources for these markets, are common in China as well as in many developing countries. Because the H9N2 virus could be a source of internal genes for the H7N9 virus, we conducted surveillance in free-range poultry and live poultry markets to study the evolution of H7N9 and H9N2 viruses in Eastern China. We found 28 samples positive for the H9N2 virus (a rate of 3.2%), but no positive samples for the H7N9 virus. Six representative H9N2 isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and the results showed that these viruses shared high nucleotide identities (99.0 to 100%) and were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees. All these 6 viruses are closely clustered with Zhejiang H9N2 chicken isolates, and belonged to genotype G57, along with some novel H7N9 strains and H9N2 strains circulating in humans in China. We hope that surveillance of AIVs in free-range poultry will be strengthened for further identification more genetic diversity.

Title: The Pandemic Threat of Emerging H5 and H7 Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: The 1918 H1N1 Spanish Influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in modern history. Unlike more recent pandemics, most of the 1918 H1N1 virus' genome was derived directly from an avian influenza virus. Recent avian-origin H5 A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GsGd) and Asian H7N9 viruses have caused several hundred human infections with high mortality rates. While these viruses have not spread beyond infected individuals, if they evolve the ability to transmit efficiently from person-to-person, specifically via the airborne route, they will initiate a pandemic. Therefore, this review examines H5 GsGd and Asian H7N9 viruses that have caused recent zoonotic infections with a focus on viral properties that support airborne transmission. Several GsGd H5 and Asian H7N9 viruses display molecular changes that potentiate transmission and/or exhibit ability for limited transmission between ferrets. However, the hemagglutinin of these viruses is unstable; this likely represents the most significant obstacle to the emergence of a virus capable of efficient airborne transmission. Given the global disease burden of an influenza pandemic, continued surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts against H5 GsGd and Asian lineage H7N9 viruses are warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing viral properties related to airborne transmission and pandemic threat but does not present explicit experimental links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Why Do Exceptionally Dangerous Gain-of-Function Experiments in Influenza?
Abstract: This chapter makes the case against performing exceptionally dangerous gain-of-function experiments that are designed to create potentially pandemic and novel strains of influenza, for example, by enhancing the airborne transmissibility in mammals of highly virulent avian influenza strains. This is a question of intense debate over the last 5 years, though the history of such experiments goes back at least to the synthesis of viable influenza A H1N1 (1918) based on material preserved from the 1918 pandemic. This chapter makes the case that experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are nearly unique in that they present biosafety risks that extend well beyond the experimenter or laboratory performing them; an accidental release could, as the name suggests, lead to global spread of a virulent virus, a biosafety incident on a scale never before seen. In such cases, biosafety considerations should be uppermost in the consideration of alternative approaches to experimental objectives and design, rather than being settled after the fact, as is appropriately done for most research involving pathogens. The extensive recent discussion of the magnitude of risks from such experiments is briefly reviewed. The chapter argues that, while there are indisputably certain questions that can be answered only by gain-of-function experiments in highly pathogenic strains, these questions are narrow and unlikely to meaningfully advance public health goals such as vaccine production and pandemic prediction. Alternative approaches to experimental influenza virology and characterization of existing strains are in general completely safe, higher throughput, more generalizable, and less costly than creation of PPP in the laboratory and can thereby better inform public health. Indeed, virtually every finding of recent PPP experiments that has been cited for its public health value was predated by similar findings using safe methodologies. The chapter concludes that the unique scientific and public health value of PPP experiments is inadequate to justify the unique risks they entail and that researchers would be well-advised to turn their talents to other methodologies that will be safe and more rewarding scientifically.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a perspective/review discussing the risks and benefits of gain-of-function experiments, not presenting explicit genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: Type I and III Interferon Productions Are Impaired in X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia Patients Toward Poliovirus but Not Influenza Virus.
Abstract: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (<i>BTK</i>) mutation. Patients are susceptible to severe enterovirus infections. The underlying mechanism remains unknown. BTK is involved in toll-like receptors pathway, which initiates antiviral responses including interferon (IFN) productions. To demonstrate type I and III IFN productions in dendritic cells of XLA patients is decreased in response to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) but not H1N1 virus. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were derived from nine XLA patients aged 22-32 years old and 23 buffy coats from Hong Kong Red Cross blood donors. LFM-A13 was used to inhibit BTK. OPV Sabin type 1 and H1N1 influenza virus were used to stimulate MoDCs with RPMI as mock stimulation. The antiviral cytokine productions and phenotypic maturation of MoDCs were determined 24 h post-stimulation. OPV RNA was determined at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post-stimulation. Upon OPV stimulation, IFN-α2, IFN-β, and IFN-λ1 productions in MoDCs from XLA patients and BTK-inhibited MoDCs of healthy controls were significantly lower than that from healthy controls. Whereas upon H1N1 stimulation, the IFN-α2, IFN-β, and IFN-λ1 productions were similar in MoDCs from XLA patients, BTK-inhibited MoDCs of healthy controls and healthy controls. The mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) of CD83, CD86, and MHC-II in MoDCs from XLA patients in response to OPV was similar to that in response to mock stimulation, while the MFI of CD83, CD86, and MHC-II were significantly higher in response to H1N1 stimulation than that in response to mock stimulation. Whereas, the MFI of CD83, CD86, and MHC-II in MoDCs of healthy controls were significantly higher in response to both OPV and H1N1 stimulation compared to that in response to mock stimulation. Production of type I and III IFN in response to OPV was deficient in MoDCs from XLA patients, but was normal in response to H1N1 due to deficient BTK function. Moreover, phenotypic maturation of MoDCs from XLA patients was impaired in response to OPV but not to H1N1. These selective impairments may account for the unique susceptibility of XLA patients toward severe enterovirus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune responses in XLA patients to poliovirus and influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Repeated detection of H7N9 avian influenza viruses in raw poultry meat illegally brought to Japan by international flight passengers.
Abstract: H7N9 highly and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV and LPAIV, respectively) have been isolated from duck meat products that were brought illegally into Japan by flight passengers in their hand luggage. These H7N9 virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevailing in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV isolate was slightly different from those of the H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 strains. These meat products contaminated with AIVs repeatedly brought into Japan lead to increased risks of poultry and public health. Continuous border disease control based on the detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is, thus, essential for the prevention of introduction and spread of AIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports detection and phylogenetic relatedness of H7N9 viruses in meat products but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Nucleoside-modified mRNA immunization elicits influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibodies.
Abstract: Currently available influenza virus vaccines have inadequate effectiveness and are reformulated annually due to viral antigenic drift. Thus, development of a vaccine that confers long-term protective immunity against antigenically distant influenza virus strains is urgently needed. The highly conserved influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stalk represents one of the potential targets of broadly protective/universal influenza virus vaccines. Here, we evaluate a potent broadly protective influenza virus vaccine candidate that uses nucleoside-modified and purified mRNA encoding full-length influenza virus HA formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). We demonstrate that immunization with HA mRNA-LNPs induces antibody responses against the HA stalk domain of influenza virus in mice, rabbits, and ferrets. The HA stalk-specific antibody response is associated with protection from homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza virus infection in mice.
Relevant: False

Title: Alternative Strategy for a Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Virus Vaccine.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections continue to pose a major public health threat worldwide associated with seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Vaccination is considered the first line of defense against influenza. Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIVs) may provide superior responses compared to inactivated vaccines because the former can better elicit a combination of humoral and cellular responses by mimicking a natural infection. Unfortunately, during the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 seasons, concerns emerged about the effectiveness of the only LAIV approved in the United States that prevented the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) from recommending its use. Such drawbacks open up the opportunity for alternative LAIV strategies that could overcome such concerns. Previously, we developed a combined strategy of temperature-sensitive mutations in the PB2 and PB1 segments and an epitope tag in the C terminus of PB1 that effectively attenuates influenza A viruses of avian and mammalian origin. More recently, we adopted a similar strategy for influenza B viruses. The resulting attenuated (<i>att</i>) influenza A and B viruses were safe, immunogenic, and protective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a variety of animal models. In this report, we provide evidence of the potential use of our <i>att</i> strategy in a quadrivalent LAIV (QIV) formulation carrying H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A virus subtype viruses and two antigenic lineages of influenza B viruses. In naive DBA/2J mice, two doses of the QIV elicited hemagglutination inhibition (HI) responses with HI titers of ≥40 and effectively protected against lethal challenge with prototypical pandemic H1N1 influenza A and influenza B virus strains.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Seasonal influenza viruses infect 1 billion people worldwide and are associated with ∼500,000 deaths annually. In addition, the never-ending emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses associated with lethal human infections and of pandemic concern calls for the development of better vaccines and/or vaccination strategies against influenza virus. Regardless of the strategy, novel influenza virus vaccines must aim at providing protection against both seasonal influenza A and B viruses. In this study, we tested an alternative quadrivalent live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (QIV) formulation whose individual components have been previously shown to provide protection. We demonstrate in proof-of principle studies in mice that the QIV provides effective protection against lethal challenge with either influenza A or B virus.

Title: Characterization of avian influenza virus attachment patterns to human and pig tissues.
Abstract: Wild birds of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Occasionally, IAVs transmit and adapt to mammalian hosts, and are maintained as epidemic strains in their new hosts. Viral adaptions to mammalian hosts include altered receptor preference of host epithelial sialylated oligosaccharides from terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) towards α2,6-linked SA. However, α2,3-linked SA has been found in human respiratory tract epithelium, and human infections by avian IAVs (AIVs) have been reported. To further explore the attachment properties of AIVs, four AIVs of different subtypes were investigated on human and pig tissues using virus histochemistry. Additionally, glycan array analysis was performed for further characterization of IAVs' receptor structure tropism. Generally, AIV attachment was more abundant to human tissues than to pig tissues. The attachment pattern was very strong to human conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract, but variable to the lower respiratory tract. AIVs mainly attached to α2,3-linked SA, but also to combinations of α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA. The low attachment of these AIV isolates to pig tissues, but high attachment to human tissues, addresses the question whether AIVs in general require passage through pigs to obtain adaptions towards mammalian receptor structures.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes virus attachment patterns to tissues but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus inhibits influenza virus replication by inducing IL-37.
Abstract: The influenza virus is one of the major pathogens that seriously affect human health. It can cause a strong immune response and trigger a series of complications. Interleukin 37 (IL-37) is a newly discovered cytokine that plays an important regulatory role in infection and immunity. To date, there have been few studies on the correlation between influenza virus infection and IL-37. Serum levels of IL-37 in 115 patients with influenza A virus (IAV) infection and 102 healthy subjects were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect differences in IL-37 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between IAV patients and healthy subjects. IL-37 expression was measured in A549 cells and PBMCs infected with IAV H3N2 using ELISA and RT-qPCR. After the H3N2-infected A549 cells were treated with human IL-37, the concentration of viral RNA was determined using RT-qPCR, and the titer of influenza virus was determined by a hemagglutination test. The IL-37 levels in the sera and PBMCs of patients infected with IAV were higher than those of healthy subjects. The expression of IL-37 mRNA and protein in IAV-infected A549 cells and PBMCs was upregulated, and IL-37 protein was able to inhibit the replication of IAV RNA. IAV-induced IL-37 expression inhibits IAV replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host immune response (IL-37) to influenza infection and its effect on viral replication, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: Nuclear-resident RIG-I senses viral replication inducing antiviral immunity.
Abstract: The nucleus represents a cellular compartment where the discrimination of self from non-self nucleic acids is vital. While emerging evidence establishes a nuclear non-self DNA sensing paradigm, the nuclear sensing of non-self RNA, such as that from nuclear-replicating RNA viruses, remains unexplored. Here, we report the identification of nuclear-resident RIG-I actively involved in nuclear viral RNA sensing. The nuclear RIG-I, along with its cytoplasmic counterpart, senses influenza A virus (IAV) nuclear replication leading to a cooperative induction of type I interferon response. Its activation signals through the canonical signaling axis and establishes an effective antiviral state restricting IAV replication. The exclusive signaling specificity conferred by nuclear RIG-I is reinforced by its inability to sense cytoplasmic-replicating Sendai virus and appreciable sensing of hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA in the nucleus. These results refine the RNA sensing paradigm for nuclear-replicating viruses and reveal a previously unrecognized subcellular milieu for RIG-I-like receptor sensing.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates nuclear RIG-I sensing of viral RNA and antiviral immunity, focusing on host sensing mechanisms rather than linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A(H5N1) viruses with A(H9N2) single gene (matrix or PB1) reassortment isolated from Cambodian live bird markets.
Abstract: Live bird market surveillance for avian influenza viruses in Cambodia in 2015 has led to the detection of two 7:1 reassortant influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1c viruses. These reassortant strains, designated A/duck/Cambodia/Z564W35M1/2015 and A/chicken/Cambodia/Z850W49M1/2015, both contained a single gene (PB1 and matrix gene, respectively) from concurrently circulating A(H9N2) influenza viruses. All other viral genes from both isolates clustered with A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1 viruses. Continued and prolonged co-circulation of influenza A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) viruses in Cambodian live bird markets may present a risk for the emergence of novel influenza reassortant viruses with negative agricultural and/or public health implications.

Title: Reemergence of H3N8 Equine Influenza A virus in Chile, 2018.
Abstract: A new outbreak of equine Influenza A virus (IAV) was reported in Chile in January 2018, 6 years after its last report in 2012. Equine IAV was detected by rtRT-PCR, followed by virus isolation and full genome sequencing. Genetic characterization of equine IAV classified the virus within clade 1 of the Florida sublineage. Although this is the same sublineage that caused an outbreak in Chile in 2012, the virus has a high similarity to other cocirculating viruses that were recently identified in Europe and Asia. The Chilean 2018 equine influenza (EI) outbreak was caused by an H3N8 strain circulating globally that spread through horse movements.

Title: The parts are greater than the whole: the role of semi-infectious particles in influenza A virus biology.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) genome is incorporated into newly produced virions through a tightly orchestrated process that is one of the best studied examples of genome packaging by a segmented virus. Despite the remarkable selectivity and efficiency of this process, it is clear that the vast majority of IAV virions are unable to express the full set of essential viral gene products and are thus incapable of productive replication in the absence of complementation. Here, we attempt to reconcile the widespread production of these semi-infectious particles (SIPs) with the high efficiency and selectivity of IAV genome packaging. We also cover what is known and what remains unknown about the consequences of SIP production for the replication and evolution of viral populations.
Relevant: False

Title: Deep sequencing of the mouse lung transcriptome reveals distinct long non-coding RNAs expression associated with the high virulence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice.
Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multiple key regulatory roles in various biological processes. However, their function in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenicity remains largely unexplored. Here, using next generation sequencing, we systemically compared the whole-transcriptome response of the mouse lung infected with either the highly pathogenic (A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010, CK10) or the nonpathogenic (A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010, GS10) H5N1 virus. A total of 126 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) lncRNAs from three replicates were identified to be associated with the high virulence of CK10, whereas 94 SDE lncRNAs were related with GS10. Functional category analysis suggested that the SDE lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs regulated by CK10 were highly related with aberrant and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Further canonical pathway analysis also confirmed that these targets were highly enriched for inflammatory-related pathways. Moreover, 9 lncRNAs and 17 lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs associated with a large number of targeted genes were successfully verified by qRT-PCR. One targeted lncRNA (NONMMUT011061) that was markedly activated and correlated with a great number of mRNAs was selected for further in-depth analysis, including predication of transcription factors, potential interacting proteins, genomic location, coding ability and construction of the secondary structure. More importantly, NONMMUT011061 was also distinctively stimulated during the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus infection in mice, suggesting a potential universal role of NONMMUT011061 in the pathogenesis of different H5 IAV. Altogether, these results provide a subset of lncRNAs that might play important roles in the pathogenesis of influenza virus and add the lncRNAs to the vast repertoire of host factors utilized by IAV for infection and persistence.

Title: Late Endosomal/Lysosomal Cholesterol Accumulation Is a Host Cell-Protective Mechanism Inhibiting Endosomal Escape of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: To transfer the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm, internalized influenza A virus (IAV) particles depend on the fusion of the IAV envelope with host endosomal membranes. The antiviral host interferon (IFN) response includes the upregulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which inhibits the release of the viral content into the cytosol. Although IFITM3 induction occurs concomitantly with late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) cholesterol accumulation, the functional significance of this process is not well understood. Here we report that LE/L cholesterol accumulation itself plays a pivotal role in the early antiviral defense. We demonstrate that inducing LE/L cholesterol accumulation is antiviral in non-IFN-primed cells, restricting incoming IAV particles and impairing mixing of IAV/endosomal membrane lipids. Our results establish a protective function of LE/L cholesterol accumulation and suggest endosomal cholesterol balance as a possible antiviral target.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> With annual epidemics occurring in all parts of the world and the risk of global outbreaks, influenza A virus (IAV) infections remain a major threat to public health. Infected host cells detect viral components and mount an interferon (IFN)-mediated response to restrict virus propagation and spread of infection. Identification of cellular factors and underlying mechanisms that establish such an antiviral state can provide novel strategies for the development of antiviral drugs. The contribution of LE/L cholesterol levels, especially in the context of the IFN-induced antiviral response, has remained controversial so far. Here, we report that accumulation of cholesterol in the LE/L compartment contributes to the IFN-induced host cell defense against incoming IAV. Our results establish cholesterol accumulation in LE/L <i>per se</i> as a novel antiviral barrier and suggest the endosomal cholesterol balance as a putative druggable host cell factor in IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host cell cholesterol accumulation as an antiviral mechanism without linking viral genotype changes to phenotypes.

Title: Estriol Reduces Pulmonary Immune Cell Recruitment and Inflammation to Protect Female Mice From Severe Influenza.
Abstract: Estriol (E3) is an endogenous estrogen in females with broad biological activity within diverse tissue types. In the context of certain T-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory diseases, E3 can ameliorate disease severity through immunomodulatory mechanisms that decrease tissue inflammation. Severe disease caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection is also characterized by aberrant inflammation and immunopathology. How E3 might affect the pathogenesis of IAV infection, however, has not been explored. Gonadally intact female C57BL/6 mice that were treated with exogenous E3 during infection with mouse-adapted 2009 H1N1 had reduced total pulmonary inflammation and improved disease outcomes compared with females that received no hormone. Furthermore, compared with no hormone treatment, E3 treatment reduced the induction of genes associated with proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses in the lungs, which preceded clinical disease, reductions in innate immune cell recruitment, altered pulmonary T-cell skewing, and reduced antibody titers during IAV infection. Although E3 treatment was associated with reduced local and systemic anti-influenza adaptive immune responses, there was no effect of E3 on viral replication or clearance. Together, these data suggest that exogenous E3 confers protection during IAV infection through immunomodulatory mechanisms and that E3 may have broad therapeutic potential in the context of both infectious and noninfectious inflammatory diseases.

Title: αv Integrins regulate germinal center B cell responses through noncanonical autophagy.
Abstract: Germinal centers (GCs) are major sites of clonal B cell expansion and generation of long-lived, high-affinity antibody responses to pathogens. Signaling through TLRs on B cells promotes many aspects of GC B cell responses, including affinity maturation, class switching, and differentiation into long-lived memory and plasma cells. A major challenge for effective vaccination is identifying strategies to specifically promote GC B cell responses. Here, we have identified a mechanism of regulation of GC B cell TLR signaling, mediated by αv integrins and noncanonical autophagy. Using B cell-specific αv-KO mice, we show that loss of αv-mediated TLR regulation increased GC B cell expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching, and generation of long-lived plasma cells after immunization with virus-like particles (VLPs) or antigens associated with TLR ligand adjuvants. Furthermore, targeting αv-mediated regulation increased the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to influenza virus vaccination. These data therefore identify a mechanism of regulation of GC B cells that can be targeted to enhance antibody responses to vaccination.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host immune regulation mechanisms affecting antibody responses without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The influenza virus hemagglutinin head evolves faster than the stalk domain.
Abstract: The limited ability of current influenza virus vaccines to protect from antigenically drifted or shifted viruses creates a public health problem that has led to the need to develop effective, broadly protective vaccines. While current influenza virus vaccines mostly induce an immune response against the immunodominant and variable head domain of the hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein of the virus, the hemagglutinin stalk domain has been identified to harbor neutralizing B-cell epitopes that are conserved among and even between influenza A virus subtypes. A complete understanding of the differences in evolution between the main target of current vaccines and this more conserved stalk region are missing. Here, we performed an evolutionary analysis of the stalk domains of the hemagglutinin of pre-pandemic seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2, and influenza B viruses and show quantitatively for the first time that the stalk domain is evolving at a rate that is significantly slower than that of the head domain. Additionally, we found that the cross-reactive epitopes in the stalk domain targeted by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are evolving at an even slower rate compared to the full head and stalk regions of the protein. Finally, a fixed-effects likelihood selection analysis was performed for these virus groups in both the head and stalk domains. While several positive selection sites were found in the head domain, only a single site in the stalk domain of pre-pandemic seasonal H1 hemagglutinin was identified at amino acid position 468 (H1 numbering from methionine). This site is not located in or close to the epitopes of cross-reactive anti-stalk monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, we found that changes in this site do not significantly impact virus binding or neutralization by human anti-stalk antibodies, suggesting that some positive selection in the stalk domain is independent of immune pressures. We conclude that, while the stalk domain does evolve over time, this evolution is slow and, historically, is not directed to aid in evading neutralizing antibody responses.

Title: The clinically approved MEK inhibitor Trametinib efficiently blocks influenza A virus propagation and cytokine expression.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are still a major global threat for humans, especially for the risk groups of young children and the elderly. Annual epidemics and sporadically occurring pandemics highlight the necessity of effective antivirals that can limit viral replication. The currently licensed antiviral drugs target viral factors and are prone to provoke viral resistance. In infected host cells IAV induces various cellular signaling cascades. The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is indispensable for IAV replication because it triggers the nuclear export of newly assembled viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Inhibition of this cascade limits viral replication. Thus, next to their potential in anti-tumor therapy, inhibitors targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade came into focus as potential antiviral drugs. The first licensed MEK inhibitor Trametinib (GSK-1120212) is used for treatment of malignant melanoma, being highly selective and having a promising side effect profile. Since Trametinib may be qualified for a repurposing approach that would significantly shorten development time for an anti-flu use, we evaluated its antiviral potency and mode of action. In this study, we describe that Trametinib efficiently blocks replication of different IAV subtypes in vitro and in vivo. The broad antiviral activity against various IAV strains was due to its ability to interfere with export of progeny vRNPs from the nucleus. The compound also limited hyper-expression of several cytokines. Thus, we show for the first time that a clinically approved MEK inhibitor acts as a potent anti-influenza agent.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates the antiviral effect of a MEK inhibitor on influenza virus replication but does not analyze viral genotypes or link them to phenotypes.

Title: Anti-Influenza A Viral Butenolide from <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. Smu03 Inhabiting the Intestine of <i>Elephas maximus</i>.
Abstract: Actinobacteria are a phylum of bacteria known for their potential in producing structurally diversified natural products that are always associated with a broad range of biological activities. In this paper, using an H5N1 pseudo-typed virus drug screening system combined with a bioassay guided purification approach, an antiviral butanolide (<b>1</b>) was identified from the culture broth of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. SMU03, a bacterium isolated from the feces of <i>Elephas maximus</i> in Yunnan province, China. This compound displayed broad and potent activity against a panel of influenza viruses including H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, as well as influenza B virus and clinical isolates with half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC<sub>50</sub>) in the range of 0.29 to 12 µg/mL. In addition, 1 was also active against oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus strain of A/PR/8/34 with NA-H274Y mutation. Studies on the detailed modes of action suggested that <b>1</b> functioned by interfering with the fusogenic process of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV), thereby blocking the entry of virus into host cells. Furthermore, the anti-IAV activity of <b>1</b> was assessed with infected BALB/c mice, of which the appearance, weight, and histopathological changes in the infected lungs were significantly alleviated compared with the no-drug-treated group. Conclusively, these results provide evidence that natural products derived from microbes residing in animal intestines might be a good source for antiviral drug discovery.

Title: Synergic effect of curcumin and its structural analogue (Monoacetylcurcumin) on anti-influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Curcumin (Cur), a polyphenolic compound extracted from spice and common food colourant turmeric, contains versatile bio-activities. Monoacetylcurcumin (MAC), a structural analogue of Cur, differs from Cur by acetyl modification, but retains enone groups. Comparative analysis revealed MAC effectively inhibited influenza virus infection (IAV) to a similar extent as, if not superior to, curcumin. Both compounds mildly reduced viral NA activity. Surprisingly, unlike Cur, the MAC inhibition of IAV did not occur through the blocking of HA activity. However, MAC strongly dampened Akt phosphorylation, the prerequisite signalling for efficient IAV propagation. A much stronger inhibition effect on IAV infection was observed when MAC treatment was in combination with Cur. Collectively, MAC demonstrated clear antiviral activity, and likely inhibited IAV via multiple mechanisms that were not identical to Cur. Importantly, Cur and MAC in combination synergistically inhibited IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates antiviral effects of curcumin and its analogue on influenza virus infection mechanisms without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Comparative studies of alignment, alignment-free and SVM based approaches for predicting the hosts of viruses based on viral sequences.
Abstract: Predicting the hosts of newly discovered viruses is important for pandemic surveillance of infectious diseases. We investigated the use of alignment-based and alignment-free methods and support vector machine using mononucleotide frequency and dinucleotide bias to predict the hosts of viruses, and applied these approaches to three datasets: rabies virus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. For coronavirus, we used the spike gene sequences, while for rabies and influenza A viruses, we used the more conserved nucleoprotein gene sequences. We compared the three methods under different scenarios and showed that their performances are highly correlated with the variability of sequences and sample size. For conserved genes like the nucleoprotein gene, longer k-mers than mono- and dinucleotides are needed to better distinguish the sequences. We also showed that both alignment-based and alignment-free methods can accurately predict the hosts of viruses. When alignment is difficult to achieve or highly time-consuming, alignment-free methods can be a promising substitute to predict the hosts of new viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on computational methods to predict viral hosts from sequences but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylodynamic Model Adequacy Using Posterior Predictive Simulations.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur, such that, it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy, a package for the popular BEAST2 software that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analyzing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1 influenza data were best described by the birth-death susceptible-infected-recovered model.

Title: Long-Term Culture of Distal Airway Epithelial Cells Allows Differentiation Towards Alveolar Epithelial Cells Suited for Influenza Virus Studies.
Abstract: As the target organ for numerous pathogens, the lung epithelium exerts critical functions in health and disease. However, research in this area has been hampered by the quiescence of the alveolar epithelium under standard culture conditions. Here, we used human distal airway epithelial cells (DAECs) to generate alveolar epithelial cells. Long-term, robust growth of human DAECs was achieved using co-culture with feeder cells and supplementation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y27632, and the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ). Removal of feeders and priming with DBZ and a cocktail of lung maturation factors prevented the spontaneous differentiation into airway club cells and instead induced differentiation to alveolar epithelial cells. We successfully transferred this approach to chicken distal airway cells, thus generating a zoonotic infection model that enables studies on influenza A virus replication. These cells are also amenable for gene knockdown using RNAi technology, indicating the suitability of the model for mechanistic studies into lung function and disease.
Relevant: False

Title: Cross-reactive mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the hemagglutinin of A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) protect against novel H7 virus isolates in the mouse model.
Abstract: Influenza viruses remain a major global public health risk. In addition to seasonal influenza viruses, epizootic influenza A H7 subtype viruses of both the Asian and North American lineage are of concern due to their pandemic potential. In China, the simultaneous occurrence of H7N9 zoonotic episodes and seasonal influenza virus epidemics could potentially lead to novel reassortant viruses with the ability to efficiently spread among humans. Recently, the H7N9 virus has evolved into two new lineages, the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta clade. This development has also resulted in viruses with a polybasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinin that are highly pathogenic in avian species and have caused human infections. In addition, an outbreak of a highly pathogenic H7N8 strain was reported in the US state of Indiana in 2016. Furthermore, an H7N2 feline virus strain caused an outbreak in cats in an animal shelter in New York City in 2016, resulting in one human zoonotic event. In this study, mouse monoclonal antibodies previously raised against the hemagglutinin of the A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) virus were tested for their (cross-) reactivity to these novel H7 viruses. Moreover, the functionality of these antibodies was assessed in vitro in hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. The therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of the broadly reactive antibodies against novel H7 viruses was determined in vivo in mouse passive transfer-viral challenge experiments. Our results provide data about the conservation of critical H7 epitopes and could inform the selection of pre-pandemic H7 vaccine strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on monoclonal antibodies raised against a specific H7N9 hemagglutinin and their cross-reactivity and protective efficacy, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Co-regulatory activity of hnRNP K and NS1-BP in influenza and human mRNA splicing.
Abstract: Three of the eight RNA segments encoded by the influenza A virus (IAV) undergo alternative splicing to generate distinct proteins. Previously, we found that host proteins hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate IAV M segment splicing, but the mechanistic details were unknown. Here we show NS1-BP and hnRNP K bind M mRNA downstream of the M2 5' splice site (5'ss). NS1-BP binds most proximal to the 5'ss, partially overlapping the U1 snRNP binding site, while hnRNP K binds further downstream and promotes U1 snRNP recruitment. Mutation of either or both the hnRNP K and NS1-BP-binding sites results in M segment mis-splicing and attenuated IAV replication. Additionally, we show that hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate host splicing events and that viral infection causes mis-splicing of some of these transcripts. Therefore, our proposed mechanism of hnRNP K/NS1-BP mediated IAV M splicing provides potential targets of antiviral intervention and reveals novel host functions for these proteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host protein regulation of influenza mRNA splicing and its effects on viral replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Host Long Noncoding RNA lncRNA-PAAN Regulates the Replication of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The productive infection of influenza A virus (IAV) depends on host factors. However, the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in IAV infection remains largely uninvestigated. In this work, we have discovered a human lncRNA, named lncRNA-PAAN (PA-associated noncoding RNA) that enhances IAV replication. The level of lncRNA-PAAN increases upon infection of IAV, but not other viruses, nor interferon treatment, suggesting specific up-regulation of lncRNA-PAAN expression by IAV. Silencing lncRNA-PAAN significantly decreases IAV replication through impairing the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This function of lncRNA-PAAN is a result of its association with viral PA protein, a key component of IAV RNA polymerase complex. Consequently, depletion of lncRNA-PAAN prevents the formation of functional RdRp. Together, these results suggest that lncRNA-PAAN promotes the assembly of viral RNA polymerase, thus warranting efficient viral RNA synthesis. Elucidating the functions of lncRNAs in IAV infection is expected to advance our understanding of IAV pathogenesis and open new avenues to the development of novel anti-IAV therapeutics.

Title: Dual-functional peptide with defective interfering genes effectively protects mice against avian and seasonal influenza.
Abstract: Limited efficacy of current antivirals and antiviral-resistant mutations impairs anti-influenza treatment. Here, we evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antiviral effect of three defective interfering genes (DIG-3) of influenza virus. Viral replication is significantly reduced in cell lines transfected with DIG-3. Mice treated with DIG-3 encoded by jetPEI-vector, as prophylaxis and therapeutics against A(H7N7) virus, respectively, have significantly better survivals (80% and 50%) than control mice (0%). We further develop a dual-functional peptide TAT-P1, which delivers DIG-3 with high efficiency and concomitantly exerts antiviral activity by preventing endosomal acidification. TAT-P1/DIG-3 is more effective than jetPEI/DIG-3 in treating A(H7N7) or A(H1N1)pdm09-infected mice and shows potent prophylactic protection on A(H7N7) or A(H1N1)pdm09-infected mice. The addition of P1 peptide, which prevents endosomal acidification, can enhance the protection of TAT-P1/DIG-3 on A(H1N1)pdm09-infected mice. Dual-functional TAT-P1 with DIG-3 can effectively protect or treat mice infected by avian and seasonal influenza virus.

Title: Influenza A Virus Facilitates Its Infectivity by Activating p53 to Inhibit the Expression of Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Proteins.
Abstract: Human influenza virus (IAV) are among the most common pathogens to cause human respiratory infections. A better understanding on interplay between IAV and host factors may provide clues for disease prevention and control. While many viruses are known to downregulate p53 upon entering the cell to reduce the innate host antiviral response, IAV infection is unusual in that it activates p53. However, it has not been clear whether this process has proviral or antiviral effects. In this study, using human isogenic p53 wild-type and p53null A549 cells generated from the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we observed that p53null cells exhibit significantly reduced viral propagation when infected with influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1). Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that p53 regulates the expression of a large set of interferon-inducible genes, among which the interferon-induced transmembrane family members IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were most significantly downregulated by the expression of p53. Knockdown of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) by short interfering RNAs enhanced influenza virus infectivity in p53null A549 cells, while overexpressed IFITMs in A549 cells blocked virus entry. Intriguingly, regulation of IFITMs by p53 is independent of its transcriptional activity, as the p53 short isoform Δ40p53 recapitulates IFITM regulation. Taken together, these data reveal that p53 activation by IAV is an essential step in maintaining its infectivity. This novel association between human p53 and the broad spectrum antiviral proteins, the IFITMs, demonstrates a previous mechanism employed by influenza virus to enhance its propagation <i>via</i> p53 inhibition of IFITMs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host p53 regulation of antiviral proteins and its effect on viral infectivity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus-derived siRNAs increase in the absence of NS1 yet fail to inhibit virus replication.
Abstract: While the issue of whether RNA interference (RNAi) ever forms part of the antiviral innate immune response in mammalian somatic cells remains controversial, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that few, if any, viral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced in infected cells. Moreover, inhibition of RNAi by mutational inactivation of key RNAi factors, such as Dicer or Argonaute 2, fails to enhance virus replication. One potential explanation for this lack of inhibitory effect is that mammalian viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) that are so effective that viral siRNAs are not produced in infected cells. Indeed, a number of mammalian VSRs have been described, of which the most prominent is the influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 protein, which has not only been reported to inhibit RNAi in plants and insects but also to prevent the production of viral siRNAs in IAV-infected human cells. Here, we confirm that an IAV mutant lacking NS1 indeed differs from wild-type IAV in that it induces the production of readily detectable levels of Dicer-dependent viral siRNAs in infected human cells. However, we also demonstrate that these siRNAs have little if any inhibitory effect on IAV gene expression. This is likely due, at least in part, to their inefficient loading into RNA-induced silencing complexes.

Title: Patient-derived avian influenza A (H5N6) virus is highly pathogenic in mice but can be effectively treated by anti-influenza polyclonal antibodies.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N6) virus has been circulating in poultry since 2013 and causes sporadic infections and fatalities in humans. Due to the re-occurrence and continuous evolution of this virus subtype, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenicity of the H5N6 virus and to identify effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. We established a mouse model to evaluate the virulence of H5N6 A/Guangzhou/39715/2014 (H5N6/GZ14), which was isolated from an infected patient. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with H5N6/GZ14 and monitored for morbidity, mortality, cytokine production, lung injury, viral replication, and viral dissemination to other organs. H5N6/GZ14 is highly pathogenic and can kill 50% of mice at a very low infectious dose of 5 plaque-forming units (pfu). Infection with H5N6/GZ14 showed rapid disease progression, viral replication to high titers in the lung, a strongly induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response, and severe lung injury. Moreover, infectious H5N6/GZ14 could be detected in the heart and brain of the infected mice. We also demonstrated that anti-influenza polyclonal antibodies generated by immunizing rhesus macaques could protect mice from lethal infection. Our results provide insights into the pathogenicity of the H5N6 human isolate.

Title: Broadly Reactive Human Monoclonal Antibodies Elicited following Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus Exposure Protect Mice against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Challenge.
Abstract: Broadly cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) that recognize conserved epitopes within the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain are of particular interest for their potential use as therapeutic and prophylactic agents against multiple influenza virus subtypes, including zoonotic virus strains. Here, we characterized four human HA stalk-reactive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for their binding breadth and affinity, <i>in vitro</i> neutralization capacity, and <i>in vivo</i> protective potential against an highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies were isolated from individuals shortly following infection with (70-1F02 and 1009-3B05) or vaccination against (05-2G02 and 09-3A01) A(H1N1)pdm09. Three of the MAbs bound HAs from multiple strains of group 1 viruses, and one MAb, 05-2G02, bound to both group 1 and group 2 influenza A virus HAs. All four antibodies prophylactically protected mice against a lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) strain. Two MAbs, 70-1F02 and 09-3A01, were further tested for their therapeutic efficacy against the same strain and showed good efficacy in this setting as well. One MAb, 70-1F02, cocrystallized with H5 HA and showed heavy-chain-only interactions similar to those seen with the previously described CR6261 anti-stalk antibody. Finally, we show that antibodies that compete with these MAbs are prevalent in serum from an individual recently infected with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The antibodies described here can be developed into broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics that could be used to combat infections by zoonotic or emerging pandemic influenza viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The rise in zoonotic infections of humans by emerging influenza viruses is a worldwide public health concern. The majority of recent zoonotic human influenza cases were caused by H7N9 and H5Nx viruses and were associated with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, seasonal influenza viruses are estimated to cause up to 650,000 deaths annually worldwide. Currently available antiviral treatment options include only neuraminidase inhibitors, but some influenza viruses are naturally resistant to these drugs, and others quickly develop resistance-conferring mutations. Alternative therapeutics are urgently needed. Broadly protective antibodies that target the conserved "stalk" domain of the hemagglutinin represent potential potent antiviral prophylactic and therapeutic agents that can assist pandemic preparedness. Here, we describe four human monoclonal antibodies that target conserved regions of influenza HA and characterize their binding spectrum as well as their protective capacity in prophylactic and therapeutic settings against a lethal challenge with a zoonotic influenza virus.

Title: Lnc-ISG20 Inhibits Influenza A Virus Replication by Enhancing ISG20 Expression.
Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many aspects of cellular processes, including the antiviral immune response. To identify influenza A virus (IAV)-related lncRNAs, we performed RNA deep sequencing to compare the profiles of lncRNAs in A549 and HEK293T cells with or without IAV infection. We identified an IAV-upregulated lncRNA named lnc-ISG20 because it shares most of its sequence with ISG20. We found that lnc-ISG20 is an interferon-stimulated gene similar to ISG20. Overexpression of lnc-ISG20 inhibited IAV replication, while lnc-ISG20 knockdown favored viral replication, suggesting that lnc-ISG20 is inhibitory to IAV replication. Further study indicated that overexpression of lnc-ISG20 enhances ISG20 protein levels, while knockdown of lnc-ISG20 reduces ISG20 protein levels in A549 cells induced with poly(I·C) and Sendai virus. We demonstrated that lnc-ISG20 inhibits IAV replication in an ISG20-dependent manner. As lnc-ISG20 did not affect the mRNA level of ISG20, we postulated that lnc-ISG20 may function as endogenous RNA competing with ISG20 to enhance its translation. Indeed, we identified that microRNA 326 (miR-326) is a mutual microRNA for both ISG20 and lnc-ISG20 that targets the 3' untranslated region of ISG20 mRNA to inhibit its translation. We confirmed that lnc-ISG20 can bind miR-326, which in turn decreased the amount of miR-326 bound to ISG20 mRNA. In conclusion, we identified that the IAV-upregulated lnc-ISG20 is a novel interferon-stimulated gene that elicits its inhibitory effect on IAV replication by enhancing ISG20 expression. We demonstrated that lnc-ISG20 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA to bind miR-326 to reduce its inhibition of ISG20 translation. Our results revealed the mechanism by which lnc-ISG20 inhibits IAV replication.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The replication of influenza A virus is regulated by host factors. However, the mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate IAV infection are not well understood. We identified that lnc-ISG20 is upregulated during IAV infection and is also an interferon-stimulated gene. We demonstrated that lnc-ISG20 can enhance ISG20 expression, which in turn inhibits IAV replication. Our studies indicate that lnc-ISG20 functions as a competing endogenous RNA that binds miR-326 and reduces its inhibitory effect on ISG20. Taken together, our findings reveal the mechanistic details of lnc-ISG20 negatively regulating IAV replication. These findings indicate that lnc-ISG20 plays an important role during the host antiviral immune response.

Title: Antiviral drug screening by assessing epithelial functions and innate immune responses in human 3D airway epithelium model.
Abstract: Respiratory viral infections cause mild to severe diseases, such as common cold, bronchiolitis and pneumonia and are associated with substantial burden for society. To test new molecules for shortening, alleviating the diseases or to develop new therapies, relevant human in vitro models are mandatory. MucilAir™, a human standardized air-liquid interface 3D airway epithelial culture holds in vitro specific mechanisms to counter invaders comparable to the in vivo situation, such as mucus production, mucociliary clearance, and secretion of defensive molecules. The objective of this study was to test the relevance of such a model for the discovery and validation of antiviral drugs. Fully differentiated 3D nasal epithelium cultures were inoculated with picornaviruses, a coronavirus and influenza A viruses in the absence or in the presence of reference antiviral drugs. Results showed that, rupintrivir efficiently inhibits the replication of respiratory picornaviruses in a dose dependent manner and prevents the impairment of the mucociliary clearance. Similarly, oseltamivir reduced the replication of influenza A viruses in a dose dependent manner and prevented the impairment of the epithelial barrier function and cytotoxicity until 4 days of infection. In addition we found that Rhinovirus B14, C15 and influenza A(H1N1) induce significant increase of β Defensins 2 and Cathelicidin release with different time course. These results reveal that a large panel of epithelial functions is modified upon viral infection and validate MucilAir™ as a pertinent tool for pre-clinical antiviral drug testing.

Title: Pandemic Avian Influenza and Intra/Interhaemagglutinin Subtype Electrostatic Variation among Viruses Isolated from Avian, Mammalian, and Human Hosts.
Abstract: Host jump can result in deadly pandemic events when avian influenza A viruses broaden their host specificity and become able to infect mammals, including humans. Haemagglutinin-the major capsid protein in influenza A viruses-is subjected to high rate mutations, of which several occur at its "head": the receptor-binding domain that mediates specific binding to host cell receptors. Such surface-changing mutations may lead to antigenically novel influenza A viruses hence in pandemics by host jump and in vaccine escape by antigenic drift. Changes in haemagglutinin surface electrostatics have been recently associated with antigenic drift and with clades evolution and spreading in H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. We performed a comparative analysis of haemagglutinin surface electrostatics to investigate clustering and eventual fingerprints among representative pandemic (H5 and H7) and nonpandemic (H4 and H6) avian influenza viral subtypes. We observed preferential sorting of viruses isolated from mammalian/human hosts among these electrostatic clusters of a subtype; however, sorting was not "100% specific" to the different clusters. Therefore, electrostatic fingerprints can help in understanding, but they cannot explain alone the host jumping mechanism.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes electrostatic variation in hemagglutinin among influenza viruses but concludes that electrostatic fingerprints alone cannot explain host jumping, thus not explicitly linking genotype to phenotype.

Title: miR-21-3p Regulates Influenza A Virus Replication by Targeting Histone Deacetylase-8.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. miRNAs are a class of small noncoding single-stranded RNA molecules that can negatively regulate gene expression and play important roles in virus-host interaction. However, the roles of miRNAs in IAV infection are still not fully understood. Here, we profiled the cellular miRNAs of A549 cells infected with A/goose/Jilin/hb/2003 (H5N1) and a comparison A/Beijing/501/2009 (H1N1). miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR analysis showed that several miRNAs were differentially expressed in A549 cells during IAV infection. Subsequently, we demonstrated that IAV replication was essential for the regulation of these miRNAs, and bioinformatic analysis revealed that the targets of these miRNAs affected biological processes relevant to IAV replication. Specifically, miR-21-3p was found to be down-regulated in IAV-infected A549 cells and selected for further detailed analysis. Target prediction and functional study illustrated that miR-21-3p repressed the expression of HDAC8 by targeting its 3'UTR. Furthermore, we confirmed miR-21-3p could promote virus replication, which was similar to the result of knocking down HDAC8, indicating that miR-21-3p promoted IAV replication by suppressing HDAC8 expression. Altogether, our results suggest a potential host defense against IAV through down-regulation of miR-21-3p.

Title: Dissection of Influenza Infection In Vivo by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.
Abstract: The influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, both the impact of intracellular viral replication and the variation in host response across different cell types remain uncharacterized. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in the response of lung tissue cells to in vivo influenza infection. Analysis of viral and host transcriptomes in the same single cell enabled us to resolve the cellular heterogeneity of bystander (exposed but uninfected) as compared with infected cells. We reveal that all major immune and non-immune cell types manifest substantial fractions of infected cells, albeit at low viral transcriptome loads relative to epithelial cells. We show that all cell types respond primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response, and we demonstrate novel markers specific for influenza-infected as opposed to bystander cells. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapy aimed exclusively at infected cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host cell transcriptomic responses to influenza infection at the single-cell level, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Lethal Influenza in Two Related Adults with Inherited GATA2 Deficiency.
Abstract: The pathogenesis of life-threatening influenza A virus (IAV) disease remains elusive, as infection is benign in most individuals. We studied two relatives who died from influenza. We Sanger sequenced GATA2 and evaluated the mutation by gene transfer, measured serum cytokine levels, and analyzed circulating T- and B-cells. Both patients (father and son, P1 and P2) died in 2011 of H1N1pdm IAV infection at the ages of 54 and 31 years, respectively. They had not suffered from severe or moderately severe infections in the last 17 (P1) and 15 years (P2). A daughter of P1 had died at 20 years from infectious complications. Low B-cell, NK- cell, and monocyte numbers and myelodysplastic syndrome led to sequence GATA2. Patients were heterozygous for a novel, hypomorphic, R396L mutation leading to haplo-insufficiency. B- and T-cell rearrangement in peripheral blood from P1 during the influenza episode showed expansion of one major clone. No T-cell receptor excision circles were detected in P1 and P3 since they were 35 and 18 years, respectively. Both patients presented an exuberant, interferon (IFN)-γ-mediated hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. No data about patients with viremia was available. Two previously reported adult GATA2-deficient patients died from severe H1N1 IAV infection; GATA2 deficiency may predispose to life-threatening influenza in adulthood. However, a role of other genetic variants involved in immune responses cannot be ruled out. Patients with GATA2 deficiency can reach young adulthood without severe infections, including influenza, despite long-lasting complete B-cell and natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, as well as profoundly diminished T-cell thymic output.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates inherited GATA2 deficiency in patients with lethal influenza but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity in the United States During the 2017-18 Season and Composition of the 2018-19 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: The United States 2017-18 influenza season (October 1, 2017-May 19, 2018) was a high severity season with high levels of outpatient clinic and emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), high influenza-related hospitalization rates, and elevated and geographically widespread influenza activity across the country for an extended period. Nationally, ILI activity began increasing in November, reaching an extended period of high activity during January-February, and remaining elevated through March. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated through February and were predominant overall for the season; influenza B viruses predominated from March onward. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 1, 2017-May 19, 2018.<sup>†</sup>.

Title: Initial Influenza Virus Replication Can Be Limited in Allergic Asthma Through Rapid Induction of Type III Interferons in Respiratory Epithelium.
Abstract: Although asthmatics has been considered to be highly susceptible to respiratory viral infection and most studies have focused on exacerbation of asthma by influenza A virus (IAV) infection, few experimental evidences exist to directly demonstrate that asthmatic mice are actually resistant to IAV infection. Here, we show that asthmatic mice are not highly susceptible to IAV in the early stage of infection and type III interferon (IFN) maintains antiviral immune response in the lung of IAV-infected asthmatic mouse resulting in inhibition of initial viral spread. C57BL/6 mice with allergic asthma were infected with IAV (WS/33: H1N1) and survival rate, body weight, viral titer, histopathological findings of lung and cytokine profiles including IFNs and Th2 cytokines were measured. Notably, asthmatic mice were significantly resistant to IAV and showed lower viral load until 7 days after infection. Furthermore, IAV-infected asthmatic mice exhibited decreased Th2-related inflammation in lung tissue until 7 days. These increased antiviral resistant mechanism and reduced Th2 inflammation were attributable to rapid induction of type III IFNs and blockade of type III IFNs in asthmatic lung led to aggravated IAV infection and to enhance the production of Th2 cytokines. Asthmatic mice showed bi-phasic responses against IAV-caused lung infection such as rapid production of type III IFNs and subsequent induction of type II IFNs. Actually, IAV-infected asthmatic mice become vulnerable to IAV infection after 7 days with noticeable morbidity and severe weight loss. However, intranasal administration of type III IFNs protects completely asthmatic mice from IAV-mediated immunopathology and lung infection until 14 days after infection. Taken together, our study indicates that the rapid induction of type III IFN might be distinctive immunological findings in the respiratory tract of IAV-infected asthmatic mice at the early stage of infection and crucial for suppression of initial viral spread <i>in vivo</i> asthma accompanying with restriction of Th2 cytokine productions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune response (type III interferons) in asthmatic mice infected with influenza, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Evaluation of antiviral activity of Ocimum sanctum and Acacia arabica leaves extracts against H9N2 virus using embryonated chicken egg model.
Abstract: In the view of endemic avian influenza H9N2 infection in poultry, its zoonotic potential and emergence of antiviral resistance, two herbal plants, Ocimum sanctum and Acacia arabica, which are easily available throughout various geographical locations in India were taken up to study their antiviral activity against H9N2 virus. We evaluated antiviral efficacy of three different extracts each from leaves of O. sanctum (crude extract, terpenoid and polyphenol) and A. arabica (crude extract, flavonoid and polyphenol) against H9N2 virus using in ovo model. The antiviral efficacy of different leaves extracts was systematically studied in three experimental protocols viz. virucidal (dose-dependent), therapeutic (time-dependent) and prophylactic (dose-dependent) activity employing in ovo model. The maximum non-toxic concentration of each herbal extracts of O. sanctum and A. arabica in the specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs was estimated and their antiviral efficacy was determined in terms of reduction in viral titres, measured by Haemagglutination (HA) and real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. All the extracts of O. sanctum (crude extract, terpenoid and polyphenol) and A. arabica (crude extract, flavonoid and polyphenol) showed significant virucidal activity, however, crude extract <sub>ocimum</sub> and terpenoid <sub>ocimum</sub> showed highly significant to significant (p < 0.001-0.01) decrease in virus genome copy numbers with lowest dose tested. Similarly, therapeutic effect was observed in all three extracts of O. sanctum in comparison to the virus control, nevertheless, crude extract <sub>ocimum</sub> and terpenoid <sub>ocimum</sub> maintained this effect for longer period of time (up to 72 h post-incubation). None of the leaves extracts of A. arabica had therapeutic effect at 24 and 48 h post-incubation, however, only the crude extract <sub>acacia</sub> and polyphenol <sub>acacia</sub> showed delayed therapeutic effect (72 h post-inoculation). Prophylactic potential was observed in polyphenol <sub>acacia</sub> with highly significant antiviral activity compared to virus control (p < 0.001). The crude extract and terpenoid isolated from the leaves of O. sanctum and polyphenol from A. arabica has shown promising antiviral properties against H9N2 virus. Future investigations are necessary to formulate combinations of these compounds for the broader antiviral activity against H9N2 viruses and evaluate them in chickens.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2010.
Abstract: The 2010 influenza season was moderate overall, with more laboratory-confirmed cases than in earlier years (with the exception of 2009). That said, self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was equal to or lower than 2008 and earlier years. In 2010, the number of laboratory-confirmed notifications for influenza was 0.8 times the 5-year mean. High notification rates were reflected in an increase in presentations with ILI to sentinel general practices and emergency departments. Notification rates were highest in the 0-4 year age group. Infections during the season were predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with 90% of notifications being influenza A (56% A(H1N)1pdm09, 30% A(unsubtyped) and 4% A(H3N2)) and 10% being influenza B. The A(H1), A(H3) and B influenza viruses circulating during the 2010 season were antigenically similar to the respective 2010 vaccine strains. Almost all (99%) of the circulating influenza B viruses that were analysed were from the B/Victoria lineage.

Title: Effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</i> Probiotics on Human Seasonal and Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza viruses that cause recurrent seasonal epidemics to humans can be controlled with vaccine and antiviral therapy. However, the medical treatments often exhibit limited efficacy in the elderly or immunosuppressed individuals. In these cases, daily uptake of probiotic microbes may be an option to bring in health benefits against influenza. Here, we demonstrate the effects of probiotics <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> (Lp) and <i>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</i> (Lm) against seasonal and avian influenza viruses. As assessed by the plaque size reduction of human H1N1 and avian influenza H7N9 viruses, including green fluorescent protein-tagged H1N1 strain in cells, the selected Lp and Lm strains restrained viral replication in mouse lungs with statistical significance. Against lethal viral challenge, the Lp and Lm strains exhibited their beneficial effects by increasing the mean days and rates of survival of infected mice. These results suggest that, despite rather narrow ranges of protective efficacy, the dietary supplement of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Leuconostoc</i> probiotics may promote health benefits against influenza.

Reason: This study assesses probiotic effects on influenza virus infection outcomes, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Intra-host and intra-household diversity of influenza A viruses during household transmissions in the 2013 season in 2 peri-urban communities of South Africa.
Abstract: Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on sequence diversity and transmission dynamics of influenza A viruses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: MASCOT: parameter and state inference under the marginal structured coalescent approximation.
Abstract: The structured coalescent is widely applied to study demography within and migration between sub-populations from genetic sequence data. Current methods are either exact but too computationally inefficient to analyse large datasets with many sub-populations, or make strong approximations leading to severe biases in inference. We recently introduced an approximation based on weaker assumptions to the structured coalescent enabling the analysis of larger datasets with many different states. We showed that our approximation provides unbiased migration rate and population size estimates across a wide parameter range. We extend this approach by providing a new algorithm to calculate the probability of the state of internal nodes that includes the information from the full phylogenetic tree. We show that this algorithm is able to increase the probability attributed to the true sub-population of a node. Furthermore we use improved integration techniques, such that our method is now able to analyse larger datasets, including a H3N2 dataset with 433 sequences sampled from five different locations. The presented methods are part of the BEAST2 package MASCOT, the Marginal Approximation of the Structured COalescenT. This package can be downloaded via the BEAUti package manager. The source code is available at https://github.com/nicfel/Mascot.git. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Title: Cirsimaritin inhibits influenza A virus replication by downregulating the NF-κB signal transduction pathway.
Abstract: Artemisia scoparia Waldst and Kit is a famous traditional Chinese medicine widely distributed in Xinjiang, China. Flavonoids extracted from it exhibits inhibitory activities against several influenza virus strains. Despite this fact, the antiviral properties of CST, one of such flavonoids, against the influenza virus has not been reported. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the anti-influenza virus efficacy and antiviral mechanism of CST. The inhibitory activity of CST against influenza viruses was assessed by using viral titers and performing Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and a human monocytic cell line (THP-1). The mechanism of CST against influenza virus was analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay, and Western blot. CST reduced viral titers and influenza A virus (IAV) RNA and protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CST had no inhibitory effect on the attachment and release processes of the viral life cycle, as indicated by the HI and NA assays. Conversely, the CST-mediated inhibition of IAV is possibly linked to the inactivation of the NF-κB/p65 signal pathway. CST also suppressed the activation of JNK MAPK and P38 MAPK in vitro. In line with NF-κB/p65 inhibition, the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-10) and the inflammation-related protein COX-2 were downregulated by CST. CST inhibited IAV replication by downregulating the NF-κB signal transduction pathway. CST may be a potential agent or supplement against IAV infection.

Title: Review analysis and impact of co-circulating H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Bangladesh.
Abstract: Almost the full range of 16 haemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been detected either in waterfowl, land-based poultry or in the environment in Bangladesh. AIV infections in Bangladesh affected a wide range of host species of terrestrial poultry. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) H5N1 and low pathogenic AI H9N2 were found to co-circulate and be well entrenched in the poultry population, which has caused serious damage to the poultry industry since 2007. By reviewing the available scientific literature, the overall situation of AIVs in Bangladesh is discussed. All Bangladeshi (BD) H5N1 and H9N2 AIV sequences available at GenBank were downloaded along with other representative sequences to analyse the genetic diversity among the circulating AIVs in Bangladesh and to compare with the global situation. Three different H5N1 clades, 2.2.2, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.2, have been detected in Bangladesh. Only 2.3.2.1a is still present. The BD LP H9N2 viruses mostly belonged to the H9 G1 lineage but segregated into many branches, and some of these shared internal genes with HP viruses of subtypes H7N3 and H5N1. However, these reassortment events might have taken place before introduction to Bangladesh. Currently, H9N2 viruses continue to evolve their HA cleavage, receptor binding and glycosylation sites. Multiple mutations in the HA gene associated with adaptation to mammalian hosts were also observed. Strict biosecurity at farms and gradual phasing out of live-bird markets could be the key measures to better control AIVs, whereas stamping out is not a practicable option in Bangladesh. Vaccination also could be an additional tool, which however, requires careful planning. Continuous monitoring of AIVs through systematic surveillance and genetic characterisation of the viruses remains a hallmark of AI control.

Title: Host-directed combinatorial RNAi improves inhibition of diverse strains of influenza A virus in human respiratory epithelial cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains in vitro, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future in vivo studies.

Title: Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds: Virus Evolution in a Multihost Ecosystem.
Abstract: Wild ducks and gulls are the major reservoirs for avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: the Central Asian flyway, the East Africa/West Asia flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway. For six complete study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate, and overwinter in Georgia. We found a substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8, were found. Whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis after their subsequent dissemination during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with maintenance of local AIVs in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic interrelationships with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative undersampling in the area.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Waterbirds (e.g., gulls and ducks) are natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and have been shown to mediate the dispersal of AIVs at intercontinental scales during seasonal migration. The segmented genome of influenza viruses enables viral RNA from different lineages to mix or reassort when two viruses infect the same host. Such reassortant viruses have been identified in most major human influenza pandemics and several poultry outbreaks. Despite their importance, we have only recently begun to understand AIV evolution and reassortment in their natural host reservoirs. This comprehensive study illustrates AIV evolutionary dynamics within a multihost ecosystem at a stopover site where three major migratory flyways intersect. Our analysis of this ecosystem over a 6-year period provides a snapshot of how these viruses are linked to global AIV populations. Understanding the evolution of AIVs in the natural host is imperative to mitigating both the risk of incursion into domestic poultry and the potential risk to mammalian hosts, including humans.

Title: Influenza Virus: A Master Tactician in Innate Immune Evasion and Novel Therapeutic Interventions.
Abstract: Influenza is a contagion that has plagued mankind for many decades, and continues to pose concerns every year, with millions of infections globally. The frequent mutations and recombination of the influenza A virus (IAV) cast a looming threat that antigenically novel strains/subtypes will rise with unpredictable pathogenicity and fear of it evolving into a pandemic strain. There have been four major influenza pandemics, since the beginning of twentieth century, with the great 1918 pandemic being the most severe, killing more than 50 million people worldwide. The mechanisms of IAV infection, host immune responses, and how viruses evade from such defensive responses at the molecular and structural levels have been greatly investigated in the past 30 years. While this has advanced our understanding of virus-host interactions and human immunology, and has led to the development of several antiviral drugs, they have minimal impact on the clinical outcomes of infection. The heavy use of these drugs has also imposed selective pressure on IAV to evolve and develop resistance. Vaccination remains the cornerstone of public health efforts to protect against influenza; however, rapid mass-production of sufficient vaccines is unlikely to occur immediately after the beginning of a pandemic. This, therefore, requires novel therapeutic strategies against this continually emerging infectious virus with higher specificity and cross-reactivity against multiple strains/subtypes of IAVs. This review discusses essential virulence factors of IAVs that determine sustainable human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms of viral hijacking of host cells and subversion of host innate immune responses, and novel therapeutic interventions that demonstrate promising antiviral properties against IAV. This hopefully will promote discussions and investigations on novel avenues of prevention and treatment strategies of influenza, that are effective and cross-protective against multiple strains/subtypes of IAV, in preparation for the advent of future IAVs and pandemics.

Title: The Annexin A1 Receptor FPR2 Regulates the Endosomal Export of Influenza Virus.
Abstract: The Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) is a novel promising target for the treatment of influenza. During viral infection, FPR2 is activated by annexinA1, which is present in the envelope of influenza viruses; this activation promotes virus replication. Here, we investigated whether blockage of FPR2 would affect the genome trafficking of influenza virus. We found that, upon infection and cell treatment with the specific FPR2 antagonist WRW4 or the anti-FPR2 monoclonal antibody, FN-1D6-AI, influenza viruses were blocked into endosomes. This effect was independent on the strain and was observed for H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. In addition, blocking FPR2signaling in alveolar lung A549 epithelial cells with the monoclonal anti-FPR2 antibody significantly inhibited virus replication. Altogether, these results show that FPR2signaling interferes with the endosomal trafficking of influenza viruses and provides, for the first time, the proof of concept that monoclonal antibodies directed against FPR2 inhibit virus replication. Antibodies-based therapeutics have emerged as attractive reagents in infectious diseases. Thus, this study suggests that the use of anti-FPR2 antibodies against influenza hold great promise for the future.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of the host receptor FPR2 in influenza virus replication and endosomal trafficking, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H9N2 are in the course of reassorting into novel AIVs.
Abstract: In 2013, two episodes of influenza emerged in China and caused worldwide concern. A new H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) first appeared in China on February 19, 2013. By August 31, 2013, the virus had spread to ten provinces and two metropolitan cities. Of 134 patients with H7N9 influenza, 45 died. From then on, epidemics emerged sporadically in China and resulted in several victims. On November 30, 2013, a 73-year-old woman presented with an influenza-like illness. She developed multiple organ failure and died 9 d after the onset of disease. A novel reassortant AIV, H10N8, was isolated from a tracheal aspirate specimen that was obtained from the patient 7 d after onset. This case was the first human case of influenza A subtype H10N8. On 4 February, 2014, another death due to H10N8 avian influenza was reported in Jiangxi Province, China.

Title: Migratory Whooper Swans Cygnus cygnus Transmit H5N1 Virus between China and Mongolia: Combination Evidence from Satellite Tracking and Phylogenetics Analysis.
Abstract: In late 2014, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (hereafter HPAI) H5N1 outbreak infected whooper swans Cygnus cygnus wintering at the Sanmenxia Reservoir area, China, and raised concerns about migratory linkages between wintering and breeding grounds of whooper swans. In this study, 61 swans were satellite tracked from 2013 to 2016 to determine the spatial association of their migration routes and H5N1 outbreaks, and 3596 fecal samples were collected along the migration routes for virology testing. Swans departed the wintering grounds and migrated along the Yellow River, and flew over the Yin Mountains in China. The Brownian bridge movement model showed there was a high degree of spatiotemporal overlap between the core use area along the spring migration pathway and historical H5N1 events in China and Mongolia from 2005 to 2015. The H5N1 strain was isolated and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the HA gene sequence generated is genetically similar to that of the epidemic strain at a previous wintering site (the Sanmenxia Reservoir area) along its flyway. Our results identified a previously unknown migratory link of whooper swans in central China with Mongolia and confirmed that the swans could carry the HPAI H5N1 virus during migration, resulting in long-distance transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study combines satellite tracking and phylogenetic analysis to show transmission of H5N1 virus by migratory swans but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Natural Killer Cell Recruitment to the Lung During Influenza A Virus Infection Is Dependent on CXCR3, CCR5, and Virus Exposure Dose.
Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells are vital components of the antiviral immune response, but their contributions in defense against influenza A virus (IAV) are not well understood. To better understand NK cell responses during IAV infections, we examined the magnitude, kinetics, and contribution of NK cells to immunity and protection during high- and low-dose IAV infections. Herein, we demonstrate an increased accumulation of NK cells in the lung in high-dose vs. low-dose infections. In part, this increase is due to the local proliferation of pulmonary NK cells. However, the majority of NK cell accumulation within the lungs and airways during an IAV infection is due to recruitment that is partially dependent upon CXCR3 and CCR5, respectively. Therefore, altogether, our results demonstrate that NK cells are actively recruited to the lungs and airways during IAV infection and that the magnitude of the recruitment may relate to the inflammatory environment found within the tissues during high- and low-dose IAV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune cell recruitment during influenza infection and does not address viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Up-regulation of microRNA-203 in influenza A virus infection inhibits viral replication by targeting DR1.
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that play important roles in various biological processes. Much evidence shows that miRNAs are closely associated with numerous virus infections; however, involvement of cellular miRNAs in influenza A virus (IAV) infection is unclear. Here, we found that expression of miR-203 was up-regulated markedly via two different mechanisms during IAV infection. First, we examined the effects of type I interferon induced by IAV on direct activation of miR-203 expression. Next, we showed that DNA demethylation within the miR-203 promoter region in A549 cells induced its up-regulation, and that expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 was down-regulated following H5N1 virus infection. Ectopic expression of miR-203 in turn inhibited H5N1 virus replication by targeting down-regulator of transcription 1 (DR1), which was identified as a novel target of miR-203. Silencing DR1 in miR-203 knockout cells using a specific siRNA inhibited replication of the H5N1 virus, an effect similar to that of miR-203. In summary, the data show that host cell expression of miR-203 is up-regulated upon IAV infection, which increases antiviral responses by suppressing a novel target gene, DR1. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism underlying the relationship between miR-203 and IAV infection.

Title: Treemmer: a tool to reduce large phylogenetic datasets with minimal loss of diversity.
Abstract: Large sequence datasets are difficult to visualize and handle. Additionally, they often do not represent a random subset of the natural diversity, but the result of uncoordinated and convenience sampling. Consequently, they can suffer from redundancy and sampling biases. Here we present Treemmer, a simple tool to evaluate the redundancy of phylogenetic trees and reduce their complexity by eliminating leaves that contribute the least to the tree diversity. Treemmer can reduce the size of datasets with different phylogenetic structures and levels of redundancy while maintaining a sub-sample that is representative of the original diversity. Additionally, it is possible to fine-tune the behavior of Treemmer including any kind of meta-information, making Treemmer particularly useful for empirical studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methods paper describing a tool for reducing phylogenetic datasets and does not address viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Comparison of Heterosubtypic Protection in Ferrets and Pigs Induced by a Single-Cycle Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: Influenza is a major health threat, and a broadly protective influenza vaccine would be a significant advance. Signal Minus FLU (S-FLU) is a candidate broadly protective influenza vaccine that is limited to a single cycle of replication, which induces a strong cross-reactive T cell response but a minimal Ab response to hemagglutinin after intranasal or aerosol administration. We tested whether an H3N2 S-FLU can protect pigs and ferrets from heterosubtypic H1N1 influenza challenge. Aerosol administration of S-FLU to pigs induced lung tissue-resident memory T cells and reduced lung pathology but not the viral load. In contrast, in ferrets, S-FLU reduced viral replication and aerosol transmission. Our data show that S-FLU has different protective efficacy in pigs and ferrets, and that in the absence of Ab, lung T cell immunity can reduce disease severity without reducing challenge viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates vaccine efficacy and immune responses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Lipid/DNA Adjuvant-Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine Protects Rhesus Macaques From Uncontrolled Virus Replication After Heterosubtypic Influenza A Virus Challenge.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines offer little protection from mismatched viruses with antigenically distant hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins. We sought to determine if a cationic lipid/DNA complex (CLDC) adjuvant could induce heterosubtypic protection if added to a whole inactivated IAV vaccine (WIV). Adult rhesus macaques (RMs) were vaccinated and at 2 weeks boosted with either an H1N1-WIV or an H3N2-WIV, with and without CLDC adjuvant. Four weeks postboost, animals were challenged with an H1N1 IAV matched to the H1N1-WIV vaccine. After challenge, viral RNA (vRNA) levels in the trachea of control RMs and RMs vaccinated with the unadjuvanted H1 or H3 WIV vaccines were similar. However, vRNA levels in the trachea of both the H1-WIV/CLDC- and the H3-WIV/CLDC-vaccinated RMs (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) were significantly lower than in unvaccinated control RMs. Heterosubtypic protection in H3-WIV/CLDC RMs was associated with significantly higher levels of nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix-1-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies (P < 0.05) and NP-specific nonneutralizing antibody-dependent natural killer cell activation (P < 0.01) compared with unprotected H3-WIV RMs. Addition of the CLDC adjuvant to a simple WIV elicited immunity to conserved virus structural proteins in RMs that correlate with protection from uncontrolled virus replication after heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge.

Title: Neutral Theory and Rapidly Evolving Viral Pathogens.
Abstract: The evolution of viral pathogens is shaped by strong selective forces that are exerted during jumps to new hosts, confrontations with host immune responses and antiviral drugs, and numerous other processes. However, while undeniably strong and frequent, adaptive evolution is largely confined to small parts of information-packed viral genomes, and the majority of observed variation is effectively neutral. The predictions and implications of the neutral theory have proven immensely useful in this context, with applications spanning understanding within-host population structure, tracing the origins and spread of viral pathogens, predicting evolutionary dynamics, and modeling the emergence of drug resistance. We highlight the multiple ways in which the neutral theory has had an impact, which has been accelerated in the age of high-throughput, high-resolution genomics.

Title: Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Screen Identifies Host Factors Essential for Influenza Virus Replication.
Abstract: The emergence of influenza A viruses (IAVs) from zoonotic reservoirs poses a great threat to human health. As seasonal vaccines are ineffective against zoonotic strains, and newly transmitted viruses can quickly acquire drug resistance, there remains a need for host-directed therapeutics against IAVs. Here, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in human lung epithelial cells with a human isolate of an avian H5N1 strain. Several genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis and related glycosylation pathways were highly enriched post-H5N1 selection, including SLC35A1, a sialic acid transporter essential for IAV receptor expression and thus viral entry. Importantly, we have identified capicua (CIC) as a negative regulator of cell-intrinsic immunity, as loss of CIC resulted in heightened antiviral responses and restricted replication of multiple viruses. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be utilized for the discovery of host factors critical for the replication of intracellular pathogens.

Reason: The paper focuses on host factors essential for viral replication identified by CRISPR screen, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Topical application of aminoglycoside antibiotics enhances host resistance to viral infections in a microbiota-independent manner.
Abstract: Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in humans. However, the impact of antibiotic use on host cells is understudied. Here we identify an antiviral effect of commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics. We show that topical mucosal application of aminoglycosides prophylactically increased host resistance to a broad range of viral infections including herpes simplex viruses, influenza A virus and Zika virus. Aminoglycoside treatment also reduced viral replication in primary human cells. This antiviral activity was independent of the microbiota, because aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice. Microarray analysis uncovered a marked upregulation of transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following aminoglycoside application. ISG induction was mediated by Toll-like receptor 3, and required Toll/interleukin-1-receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β signalling adaptor, and Interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7, transcription factors that promote ISG expression. XCR1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, which uniquely express Toll-like receptor 3, were recruited to the vaginal mucosa upon aminoglycoside treatment and were required for ISG induction. These results highlight an unexpected ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to confer broad antiviral resistance in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the antiviral effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics on host resistance, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: IFIT1 Expression Patterns Induced by H9N2 Virus and Inactivated Viral Particle in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells and Bronchus Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: IFIT1 (also known as ISG56) is a member of the interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family. IFITs are strongly induced by type I interferon (IFN), double-stranded RNA and virus infection. Here, we investigated IFIT1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in human bronchus epithelial cells (BEAS-2Bs) induced by the H9N2 virus and inactivated viral particle at different time points. We also investigated the effect of H9N2 virus and viral particle infection on IFN-α/β production, and assessed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase protein induced IFIT1 expression. Results showed that both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation induced the expression of IFIT1 at mRNA and protein levels in the two cell lines. Hemagglutinin or neuraminidase protein binding alone is not sufficient to induce IFIT1 expression. Surprisingly, the expression patterns of IFIT1 in response to H9N2 virus and viral particles in the two cell lines were opposite, and production kinetics of IFN-α/β also differed. An additional finding was that induction of IFIT1 in response to H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation was more sensitive in HUVECs than in BEAS-2Bs. Our data offers new insight into the innate immune response of endothelial cells to H9N2 virus infection.
Relevant: False

Title: A small-molecule fragment that emulates binding of receptor and broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza A hemagglutinin.
Abstract: The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion during viral entry in host cells. Blocking these key steps in viral infection has applications for development of novel antiinfluenza therapeutics as well as vaccines. However, the lack of structural information on how small molecules can gain a foothold in the small, shallow receptor-binding site (RBS) has hindered drug design against this important target on the viral pathogen. Here, we report on the serendipitous crystallization-based discovery of a small-molecule <i>N</i>-cyclohexyltaurine, commonly known as the buffering agent CHES, that is able to bind to both group-1 and group-2 HAs of influenza A viruses. X-ray structural characterization of group-1 H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5/Viet) and group-2 H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3/HK68) HAs at 2.0-Å and 2.57-Å resolution, respectively, revealed that <i>N</i>-cyclohexyltaurine binds to the heart of the conserved HA RBS. <i>N</i>-cyclohexyltaurine mimics the binding mode of the natural receptor sialic acid and RBS-targeting bnAbs through formation of similar hydrogen bonds and CH-π interactions with the HA. In H3/HK68, <i>N</i>-cyclohexyltaurine also binds to a conserved pocket in the stem region, thereby exhibiting a dual-binding mode in group-2 HAs. These long-awaited structural insights into RBS recognition by a noncarbohydrate-based small molecule enhance our knowledge of how to target this important functional site and can serve as a template to guide the development of novel broad-spectrum small-molecule therapeutics against influenza virus.

Title: Wild birds in Chile Harbor diverse avian influenza A viruses.
Abstract: While the circulation of avian influenza viruses (IAV) in wild birds in the northern hemisphere has been well documented, data from South America remain sparse. To address this gap in knowledge, we undertook IAV surveillance in wild birds in parts of Central and Northern Chile between 2012 and 2015. A wide diversity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were identified and 16 viruses were isolated including low pathogenic H5 and H7 strains, making this the largest and most diverse collection of Chilean avian IAVs to date. Unlike IAVs isolated from wild birds in other South American countries where the genes were most like viruses isolated from wild birds in either North America or South America, the Chilean viruses were reassortants containing genes like viruses isolated from both continents. In summary, our studies demonstrate that genetically diverse avian IAVs are circulating in wild birds in Chile highlighting the need for further investigation in this understudied area of the world.

Title: Dynamic analysis of expression of chemokine and cytokine gene responses to H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses in DF-1 cells.
Abstract: H5N1 and H9N2 are the most important causes of avian influenza in China. Chemokines and cytokines play important roles in inflammatory response that clearly differ between H5N1 and H9N2 infection. To investigate whether chemokines and cytokines are differentially regulated following H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs infection, dynamic expression of chemokines and cytokines, including IL8L1, IL8L2, CX3CL1, CCL5, CCL20, K203, SCYA4, XLC1, CCLi10, CCL19, IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in DF-1 cells. It was found that IL8L1, IL8L2, CX3CL1, CCL5, CCL20, K203, SCYA4, IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α increased significantly after induction of H5N1 or H9N2 AIV infection, whereas no expression of XCL1, CCLi10 or CCL19 was detected. H9N2 AIV infection was associated with much stronger chemokine responses than infection with H5N1, whereas the cytokines showed opposite results. It was found that K203 is a constant chemotactic factor independent of subtype of AIVs and infectious dose, CCL20 and IL-1β are constant regardless of the infectious dose but depend on the subtype of AIV, chemotactic factors IL8L1, IL8L2 and CCL5 are dependent both on subtype of AIVs and infectious dose, and K203, CX3CL1, SCYA4, CCL20, IFN-α, IL-1β and TNF-α are specific to responses to H5N1 AIV infection whereas K203, CCL20, IFN-β, IL-1β and IL-6 are specific to H9N2 infection. These results provide basic data for explaining differences in inflammation and phenotypes of histopathological changes caused by H5N1 and H9N2 and add new information on the roles of chemokines and cytokines in virulence of AIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host chemokine and cytokine gene expression responses to infection by different influenza subtypes, without explicit genotype-phenotype viral links.

Title: High dimensional random walks can appear low dimensional: Application to influenza H3N2 evolution.
Abstract: One important feature of the mammalian immune system is the highly specific binding of antigens to antibodies. Antibodies generated in response to one infection may also provide some level of cross immunity to other infections. One model to describe this cross immunity is the notion of antigenic space, which assigns each antibody and each virus a point in R<sup>n</sup>. Past studies using hemagglutination data have suggested the dimensionality of antigenic space, n, is low. We propose that influenza evolution may be modeled as a Gaussian random walk. We then show that hemagluttination data would be consistent with a walk in very high dimensions. The discrepancy between our result and prior studies is due to the fact that random walks can appear low dimensional according to a variety of analyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS). A high dimensionality of antigenic space is of importance to modelers, as it suggests a smaller role for pre-existing immunity within the host population.
Relevant: False

Title: Activation and Induction of Antigen-Specific T Follicular Helper Cells Play a Critical Role in Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine-Induced Human Mucosal Anti-influenza Antibody Response.
Abstract: There is increasing interest recently in developing intranasal vaccines against respiratory tract infections. The antibody response is critical for vaccine-induced protection, and T follicular helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>) are considered important for mediating the antibody response. Most data supporting the role for T<sub>FH</sub> in the antibody response are from animal studies, and direct evidence from humans is limited, apart from the presence of T<sub>FH</sub>-like cells in blood. We studied the activation and induction of T<sub>FH</sub> and their role in the anti-influenza antibody response induced by a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in human nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). T<sub>FH</sub> activation in adenotonsillar tissues was analyzed by flow cytometry, and anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibodies were examined following LAIV stimulation of tonsillar mononuclear cells (MNC). Induction of antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> by LAIV was studied by flow cytometry analysis of induced T<sub>FH</sub> and CD154 expression. LAIV induced T<sub>FH</sub> proliferation, which correlated with anti-HA antibody production, and T<sub>FH</sub> were shown to be critical for the antibody response. Induction of T<sub>FH</sub> from naive T cells by LAIV was shown in newly induced T<sub>FH</sub> expressing BCL6 and CD21, followed by the detection of anti-HA antibodies. Antigen specificity of LAIV-induced T<sub>FH</sub> was demonstrated by expression of the antigen-specific T cell activation marker CD154 upon challenge by H1N1 virus antigen or HA. LAIV-induced T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation was inhibited by BCL6, interleukin-21 (IL-21), ICOS, and CD40 signaling blocking, and that diminished anti-HA antibody production. In conclusion, we demonstrated the induction by LAIV of antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> in human NALT that provide critical support for the anti-influenza antibody response. Promoting antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> in NALT by use of intranasal vaccines may provide an effective vaccination strategy against respiratory infections in humans.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Airway infections, such as influenza, are common in humans. Intranasal vaccination has been considered a biologically relevant and effective way of immunization against airway infection. The vaccine-induced antibody response is crucial for protection against infection. Recent data from animal studies suggest that one type of T cells, T<sub>FH</sub>, are important for the antibody response. However, data on whether T<sub>FH</sub>-mediated help for antibody production operates in humans are limited due to the lack of access to human immune tissue containing T<sub>FH</sub> In this study, we demonstrate the induction of T<sub>FH</sub> in human immune tissue, providing critical support for the anti-influenza antibody response, by use of an intranasal influenza vaccine. Our findings provide direct evidence that T<sub>FH</sub> play a critical role in vaccine-induced immunity in humans and suggest a novel strategy for promoting such cells by use of intranasal vaccines against respiratory infections.

Title: Experimental infection of Cynomolgus Macaques with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus through the aerosol route.
Abstract: Several animal models are used to study influenza viruses. Intranasal inoculation of animals with a liquid inoculum is one of the main methods used to experimentally infect animals with influenza virus; however, this method does not reflect the natural infection with influenza virus by contact or aerosol route. Aerosol inhalation methods have been established with several influenza viruses for mouse and ferret models, but few studies have evaluated inoculation routes in a nonhuman primates (NHP) model. Here, we performed the experimental infection of NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and demonstrated that aerosol infection had no effect on clinical outcome, but caused broader infection throughout all of the lobes of the lung compared with a non-aerosolized approach. Aerosol infection therefore represents an option for inoculation of NHPs in future studies.

Title: Critical role of C-terminal residues of the Alzheimer's associated β-amyloid protein in mediating antiviral activity and modulating viral and bacterial interactions with neutrophils.
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the Alzheimer's associated β-amyloid protein (βA) can inhibit growth of bacteria, fungi and viruses. We reported that the 42 amino acid βA protein inhibits replication of seasonal and pandemic strains of H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) in vitro and modulates activation of neutrophils and monocytes exposed IAV. We here show that fragments composed of the N and C terminal domain of βA42, including βA22-42 and the 8 amino acid βA35-42, retain viral neutralizing and viral aggregating activity, whereas fragments lacking the C-terminal amino acids 41 and 42 (e.g. βA1-40, βA1-34, βA1-28, βA22-40 or βA33-40) have markedly diminished activities on these assays. βA22-42 also increased viral uptake, and virus induced respiratory burst responses, by human neutrophils, while peptides lacking residues 41 and 42 did not. Similar results were obtained with regard to bacterial aggregation, or promotion of bacterial uptake by neutrophils. Published structural studies have shown that βA1-42 has a greater propensity to form neurotoxic oligomers than βA1-40 due to a molecular interaction between Met35 and Ala42. Our findings suggest that there is a relationship between neurotoxic and antimicrobial activities of βA1-42. Truncated peptides containing the last 8 C-terminal amino acids of βA1-42 retain antimicrobial and opsonizing activities likely resulting from their ability to induce viral or bacterial aggregation.

Title: Stimulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors impairs influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. The emergence of viruses resistant to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 ion channel inhibitors underlines the need for alternate anti-influenza drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Here, we report the discovery of a host factor as a potential target of anti-influenza drugs. By using cell-based virus replication screening of a chemical library and several additional assays, we identified clonidine as a new anti-influenza agent in vitro. We found that clonidine, which is an agonist of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR), has an inhibitory effect on the replication of various influenza virus strains. α2-AR is a Gi-type G protein-coupled receptor that reduces intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. In-depth analysis showed that stimulation of α2-ARs leads to impairment of influenza virus replication and that α2-AR agonists inhibit the virus assembly step, likely via a cAMP-mediated pathway. Although clonidine administration did not reduce lung virus titers or prevent body weight loss, it did suppress lung edema and improve survival in a murine lethal infection model. Clonidine may thus protect against lung damage caused by influenza virus infection. Our results identify α2-AR-mediated signaling as a key pathway to exploit in the development of anti-influenza agents.

Title: Sequential Immunizations with heterosubtypic virus-like particles elicit cross protection against divergent influenza A viruses in mice.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza vaccines have proven to be effective against well-matched viruses in healthy adults. However, rapid accumulation of mutations in the main antigenic surface proteins of influenza can compromise the efficiency of flu vaccines. Occasionally, influenza pandemics arise and present a different type of challenge to current seasonal vaccines. Novel vaccination strategies that can educate the host immune system to generate immune responses focusing on conserved epitopes on theses antigenic surface proteins are crucial for controlling and limiting influenza epidemics and pandemics. In this study, we have sequentially vaccinated mice with heterosubtypic influenza HA virus-like particles (VLPs) harboring H1, H8, and H13 from the HA phylogenetic group 1, or H3, H4, and H10 from the HA phylogenetic group 2, or in various combinations. The immunized animals were fully protected when challenged with lethal doses of heterosubtypic viruses from either phylogenetic group. Our vaccination approach demonstrates a promising strategy for the development of a 'universal influenza vaccine'.

Title: Within-Host Evolution of Human Influenza Virus.
Abstract: The rapid global evolution of influenza virus begins with mutations that arise de novo in individual infections, but little is known about how evolution occurs within hosts. We review recent progress in understanding how and why influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Advances in deep sequencing make it possible to measure within-host genetic diversity in both acute and chronic influenza infections. Factors like antigenic selection, antiviral treatment, tissue specificity, spatial structure, and multiplicity of infection may affect how influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Studies of within-host evolution can contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary and epidemiological factors that shape influenza virus's global evolution.

Title: Influence of Novel Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection on Migrating Whooper Swans Fecal Microbiota.
Abstract: The migration of wild birds plays an important role in the transmission and spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, posing a severe risk to animal and human health. Substantial evidence suggests that altered gut microbial community is implicated in the infection of respiratory influenza virus. However, the influence of H5N1 infection in gut microbiota of migratory birds remains unknown. In January 2015, a novel recombinant H5N1 virus emerged and killed about 100 migratory birds, mainly including whooper swans in Sanmenxia Reservoir Area of China. Here, we describe the first fecal microbiome diversity study of H5N1-infected migratory birds. By investigating the influence of H5N1 infection on fecal bacterial communities in infected and uninfected individuals, we found that H5N1 infection shaped the gut microbiota composition by a difference in the dominance of some genera, such as <i>Aeromonas</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>. We also found a decreased α diversity and increased β diversity in infectious individuals. Our results highlight that increases in changes in pathogen-containing gut communities occur when individuals become infected with H5N1. Our study may provide the first evidence that there are statistical association among H5N1 presence and fecal microbiota compositional shifts, and properties of the fecal microbiota may serve as the risk of gut-linked disease in migrates with H5N1 and further aggravate the disease transmission.

Title: Bax Inhibitor-1 Acts as an Anti-Influenza Factor by Inhibiting ROS Mediated Cell Death and Augmenting Heme-Oxygenase 1 Expression in Influenza Virus Infected Cells.
Abstract: Influenza virus remains a major health concern worldwide, and there have been continuous efforts to develop effective antivirals despite the use of annual vaccination programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-influenza activity of Bax inhibitor-1 (<i>BI-1</i>). Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells expressing wild type <i>BI-1</i> and a non-functional <i>BI-1</i> mutant, <i>BI-1 ∆C</i> (with the C-terminal 14 amino acids deleted) were prepared and infected with A/PR/8/34 influenza virus. <i>BI-1</i> overexpression led to the suppression of virus-induced cell death and virus production compared to control Mock or <i>BI-1 ∆C</i> overexpression. In contrast to <i>BI-1 ∆C</i>-overexpressing cells, <i>BI-1</i>-overexpressing cells exhibited markedly reduced virus-induced expression of several viral genes, accompanied by a substantial decrease in ROS production. We found that treatment with a ROS scavenging agent, <i>N</i>-acetyl cysteine (NAC), led to a dramatic decrease in virus production and viral gene expression in control MDCK and <i>BI-1</i> ∆C-overexpressing cells. In contrast, NAC treatment resulted in the slight additional suppression of virus production and viral gene expression in <i>BI-1</i>-overexpressing cells but was statistically significant. Moreover, the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (<i>HO-1</i>) was also significantly increased following virus infection in <i>BI-1</i>-overexpressing cells compared to control cells. Taken together, our data suggest that BI-1 may act as an anti-influenza protein through the suppression of ROS mediated cell death and upregulation of <i>HO-1</i> expression in influenza virus infected MDCK cells.

Title: Design and synthesis of constrained bicyclic molecules as candidate inhibitors of influenza A neuraminidase.
Abstract: The rise of drug-resistant influenza A virus strains motivates the development of new antiviral drugs, with different structural motifs and substitution. Recently, we explored the use of a bicyclic (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) analogue of sialic acid that was designed to mimic the conformation adopted during enzymatic cleavage within the neuraminidase (NA; sialidase) active site. Given that our first series of compounds were at least four orders of magnitude less active than available drugs, we hypothesized that the new carbon skeleton did not elicit the same interactions as the cyclohexene frameworks used previously. Herein, we tried to address this critical point with the aid of molecular modeling and we proposed new structures with different functionalization, such as the introduction of free ammonium and guanidinium groups and ether side chains other than the 3-pentyl side chain, the characteristic side chain in Oseltamivir. A highly simplified synthetic route was developed, starting from the cyclopropanation of cyclopentenone and followed by an aziridination and further functionalization of the five-member ring. This allowed the efficient preparation of a small library of new bicyclic ligands that were characterized by enzyme inhibition assays against influenza A neuraminidases N1, its H274Y mutant, and N2. The results show that none of the new structural variants synthesized, including those containing guanidinium groups rather than free ammonium ions, displayed activity against influenza A neuraminidases at concentrations less than 2 mM. We conclude that the choice and positioning of functional groups on the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl system still need to be properly tuned for producing complementary interactions within the catalytic site.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the design and synthesis of neuraminidase inhibitors and their activity but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multiple Introductions of Influenza A(H5N8) Virus into Poultry, Egypt, 2017.
Abstract: After high mortality rates among commercial poultry were reported in Egypt in 2017, we genetically characterized 4 distinct influenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from poultry. Full-genome analysis indicated separate introductions of H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 reassortants from Europe and Asia into Egypt, which poses a serious threat for poultry and humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic characterization and introductions of H5N8 viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes such as pathogenicity or transmissibility.

Title: Use of Genome Sequencing to Define Institutional Influenza Outbreaks, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2014-15.
Abstract: Adequacy of the current clinical definition of institutional influenza outbreaks is unclear. We performed a retrospective genome sequencing and epidemiologic analysis of institutional influenza outbreaks that occurred during the 2014-15 influenza season in Toronto, Canada. We sequenced the 2 earliest submitted samples positive for influenza A(H3N2) from each of 38 reported institutional outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Genome sequencing showed most outbreak pairs identified by using the current clinical definition were highly related. Inclusion of surveillance samples demonstrated that outbreak sources were likely introductions from broader circulating lineages. Pairwise distance analysis using majority genome and hemagglutinin-specific genes enabled identification of thresholds for discrimination of within and between outbreak pairs; the area under the curve ranged 0.93-0.95. Routine genome sequencing for defining influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities is unlikely to add significantly to the current clinical definition. Sequencing may prove most useful for investigating sources of outbreak introductions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses genome sequencing to define outbreak relationships but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits such as pathogenicity or transmissibility.

Title: Lessons learned from research and surveillance directed at highly pathogenic influenza A viruses in wild birds inhabiting North America.
Abstract: Following detections of highly pathogenic (HP) influenza A viruses (IAVs) in wild birds inhabiting East Asia after the turn of the millennium, the intensity of sampling of wild birds for IAVs increased throughout much of North America. The objectives for many research and surveillance efforts were directed towards detecting Eurasian origin HP IAVs and understanding the potential of such viruses to be maintained and dispersed by wild birds. In this review, we highlight five important lessons learned from research and surveillance directed at HP IAVs in wild birds inhabiting North America: (1) Wild birds may disperse IAVs between North America and adjacent regions via migration, (2) HP IAVs can be introduced to wild birds in North America, (3) HP IAVs may cross the wild bird-poultry interface in North America, (4) The probability of encountering and detecting a specific virus may be low, and (5) Population immunity of wild birds may influence HP IAV outbreaks in North America. We review empirical support derived from research and surveillance efforts for each lesson learned and, furthermore, identify implications for future surveillance efforts, biosecurity, and population health. We conclude our review by identifying five additional areas in which we think future mechanistic research relative to IAVs in wild birds in North America are likely to lead to other important lessons learned in the years ahead.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review summarizing surveillance and research lessons without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Inflammatory Monocytes Drive Influenza A Virus-Mediated Lung Injury in Juvenile Mice.
Abstract: Healthy children are more likely to die of influenza A virus (IAV) infection than healthy adults. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the impact of young age on the development of life-threatening IAV infection. We report increased mortality in juvenile mice compared with adult mice at each infectious dose of IAV. Juvenile mice had sustained elevation of type I IFNs and persistent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the lungs, both of which were independent of viral titer. Juvenile mice, but not adult mice, had increased MCP-1 levels that remained high even after viral clearance. Importantly, continued production of MCP-1 was associated with persistent recruitment of monocytes to the lungs and prolonged elevation of inflammatory cytokines. Transcriptional signatures of recruited monocytes to the juvenile and adult IAV-infected lungs were assessed by RNA-seq. Genes associated with a proinflammatory signature were upregulated in the juvenile monocytes compared with adult monocytes. Depletion of monocytes with anti-CCR2 Ab decreased type I IFN secretion, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and lung injury in juvenile mice. This suggests an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated by increased recruitment of monocytes to the lung, and not an inability to control viral replication, is responsible for severe IAV infection in juvenile mice. This study provides insight into severe IAV infection in juveniles and identifies key inflammatory monocytes that may be central to pediatric acute lung injury secondary to IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on inflammatory monocytes and host immune response in juvenile mice infected with influenza A virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The Application of NHEJ-CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-Lox System in the Generation of Bivalent Duck Enteritis Virus Vaccine against Avian Influenza Virus.
Abstract: Duck-targeted vaccines to protect against avian influenza are critically needed to aid in influenza disease control efforts in regions where ducks are endemic for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a promising candidate viral vector for development of vaccines targeting ducks, owing to its large genome and narrow host range. The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is a versatile gene-editing tool that has proven beneficial for gene modification and construction of recombinant DNA viral vectored vaccines. Currently, there are two commonly used methods for gene insertion: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Owing to its advantages in efficiency and independence from molecular requirements of the homologous arms, we utilized NHEJ-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen expression cassette into the DEV genome. The insert was initially tagged with reporter green fluorescence protein (GFP), and a Cre-Lox system was later used to remove the <i>GFP</i> gene insert. Furthermore, a universal donor plasmid system was established by introducing double bait sequences that were independent of the viral genome. In summary, we provide proof of principle for generating recombinant DEV viral vectored vaccines against the influenza virus using an integrated NHEJ-CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-Lox system.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes the use of gene editing tools to generate a recombinant duck enteritis virus vaccine expressing influenza hemagglutinin, but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification of influenza polymerase inhibitors targeting C-terminal domain of PA through surface plasmon resonance screening.
Abstract: Currently, many strains of influenza A virus have developed resistance against anti-influenza drugs, and it is essential to find new chemicals to combat this virus. The influenza polymerase with three proteins, PA, PB1 and PB2, is a crucial component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Here, we report the identification of a hit compound 221 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) direct binding screening on the C-terminal of PA (PAC). Compound 221 can subdue influenza RNP activities and attenuate influenza virus replication. Its analogs were subsequently investigated and twelve of them could attenuate RNP activities. One of the analogs, compound 312, impeded influenza A virus replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with IC<sub>50</sub> of 27.0 ± 16.8 μM. In vitro interaction assays showed that compound 312 bound directly to PAC with Kd of about 40 μM. Overall, the identification of novel PAC-targeting compounds provides new ground for drug design against influenza virus in the future.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies polymerase inhibitors targeting influenza virus PA protein but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The human interferon (IFN)-induced MxA protein is a key antiviral host restriction factor exhibiting broad antiviral activity against many RNA viruses, including highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (IAV) of the H5N1 and H7N7 subtype. To date the mechanism for how MxA exerts its antiviral activity is unclear, however, additional cellular factors are believed to be essential for this activity. To identify MxA cofactors we performed a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human airway epithelial cells (A549) constitutively expressing MxA using an H5N1 reporter virus. These data were complemented with a proteomic screen to identify MxA-interacting proteins. The combined data identified SMARCA2, the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as a crucial factor required for the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that although SMARCA2 is essential for expression of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the establishment of an antiviral state, it is not required for expression of MxA, suggesting an indirect effect on MxA activity. Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a small set of SMARCA2-regulated factors required for activity of MxA, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3. These findings reveal that several virus-inducible factors work in concert to enable MxA restriction of IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host cell factors required for MxA antiviral activity against influenza A viruses, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Anti-influenza A virus activity of rhein through regulating oxidative stress, TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signal pathways.
Abstract: Rhein, an anthraquinone compound existing in many traditional herbal medicines, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective activities, but its anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity is ambiguous. In the present study, through plaque inhibition assay, time-of-addition assay, antioxidant assay, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and western blotting assays, we investigated the anti-IAV effect and mechanism of action of rhein in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that rhein could significantly inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, decrease IAV-induced oxidative stress, activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways, and production of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in vitro. Oxidant H2O2 and agonists of TLR4, Akt, p38/JNK and IKK/NF-κB could significantly antagonize the inhibitory effects of rhein on IAV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and IAV replication. Through an in vivo test in mice, we also found that rhein could significantly improve the survival rate, lung index, pulmonary cytokines, and pulmonary histopathological changes. Rhein also significantly decreased pulmonary viral load at a high dose. In conclusion, rhein can inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, and the mechanism of action to inhibit IAV replication may be due to its ability to suppress IAV-induced oxidative stress and activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB signal pathways.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral activity of rhein against influenza A virus and its mechanism of action, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Pathogenic mechanisms of invasive group A Streptococcus infections by influenza virus-group A Streptococcus superinfection.
Abstract: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) are pathogenic bacteria of the genus Streptococcus and cause severe invasive infections that comprise a wide range of diverse diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, toxic shock-like syndrome, sepsis, cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. The essential virulence, infected host and external environmental factors required for invasive GAS infections have not yet been determined. Superinfection with influenza virus and GAS induced invasive GAS infections was demonstrated by our team in a mouse model, after which clinical cases of invasive GAS infections secondary to influenza virus infection were reported by other investigators in Japan, USA, Canada, UK China, and other countries. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying influenza virus-GAS superinfection are not yet fully understood. The present review describes the current knowledge about invasive GAS infections by superinfection. Topics addressed include the bacteriological, virological and immunological mechanisms impacting invasion upon superinfection on top of underlying influenza virus infection by GAS and other bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). Future prospects are also discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of pathogenic mechanisms of invasive group A Streptococcus infections following influenza virus superinfection, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Antibody Immunodominance: The Key to Understanding Influenza Virus Antigenic Drift.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on humanity. Vaccination is effective in only 60% of individuals, even under optimal circumstances. The difficulty stems from the remarkable ability of IAV to evade existing immunity. IAV's error prone polymerase enables the rapid antigenic evolution of the two virion surface glycoproteins, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin (HA). Since the most potent antibodies (Abs) at neutralizing viral infectivity are directed the head of the HA, amino acid substitutions in this region enable IAV to evade Ab-based immunity. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how immunodominance, the tendency of the immune system to respond to foreign immunogens in a hierarchical manner, shapes IAV evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews antibody immunodominance and influenza virus antigenic drift without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: MERS-CoV and H5N1 influenza virus antagonize antigen presentation by altering the epigenetic landscape.
Abstract: Convergent evolution dictates that diverse groups of viruses will target both similar and distinct host pathways to manipulate the immune response and improve infection. In this study, we sought to leverage this uneven viral antagonism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome. Utilizing a systems-based approach, we examined differential regulation of IFN-γ-dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [A/influenza/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) and A/influenza/California/04/2009 (H1N1-CA04)] and coronaviruses [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)]. Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV-mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host epigenetic changes and antigen presentation modulation by viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The emerging influenza virus threat: status and new prospects for its therapy and control.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are zoonotic pathogens that cause yearly outbreaks with high rates of morbidity and fatality. The virus continuously acquires point mutations while circulating in several hosts, ranging from aquatic birds to mammals, including humans. The wide range of hosts provides influenza A viruses greater chances of genetic re-assortment, leading to the emergence of zoonotic strains and occasional pandemics that have a severe impact on human life. Four major influenza pandemics have been reported to date, and health authorities worldwide have shown tremendous progress in efforts to control epidemics and pandemics. Here, we primarily discuss the pathogenesis of influenza virus type A, its epidemiology, pandemic potential, current status of antiviral drugs and vaccines, and ways to effectively manage the disease during a crisis.

Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus pathogenesis, epidemiology, and control without presenting explicit genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: Influenza C and D Viruses Package Eight Organized Ribonucleoprotein Complexes.
Abstract: Influenza A and B viruses have eight-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes, whereas influenza C and D viruses have seven-segmented genomes. Each genomic RNA segment exists in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) in association with nucleoproteins and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in virions. Influenza D virus was recently isolated from swine and cattle, but its morphology is not fully studied. Here, we examined the morphological characteristics of D/bovine/Yamagata/10710/2016 (D/Yamagata) and C/Ann Arbor/50 (C/AA), focusing on RNPs packaged within the virions. By scanning transmission electron microscopic tomography, we found that more than 70% of D/Yamagata and C/AA virions packaged eight RNPs arranged in the "1+7" pattern as observed in influenza A and B viruses, even though type C and D virus genomes are segmented into only seven segments. These results imply that influenza viruses generally package eight RNPs arranged in the "1+7" pattern regardless of the number of RNA segments in their genome.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The genomes of influenza A and B viruses are segmented into eight segments of negative-sense RNA, and those of influenza C and D viruses are segmented into seven segments. For progeny virions to be infectious, each virion needs to package all of their genomic segments. Several studies support the conclusion that influenza A and B viruses selectively package eight distinct genomic RNA segments; however, the packaging of influenza C and D viruses, which possess seven segmented genomes, is less understood. By using electron microscopy, we showed that influenza C and D viruses package eight RNA segments just as influenza A and B viruses do. These results suggest that influenza viruses prefer to package eight RNA segments within virions independent of the number of genome segments.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on morphological characteristics of influenza C and D viruses and their ribonucleoprotein packaging, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Swarm incursions of reassortants of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains H5N8 and H5N5, clade 2.3.4.4b, Germany, winter 2016/17.
Abstract: The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5Nx viruses in winter 2016/2017 was the most severe HPAI epizootic ever reported in Germany. The H5N8 and H5N5 viruses detected in birds in Germany in 2016/2017 represent a reassortant swarm of at least five distinct genotypes, which carried closely related HA segments derived from clade 2.3.4.4b. The genotypes of these viruses and their spatio-temporal distribution indicated a unique situation with multiple independent entries of HPAIV into Germany.

Title: Importance of the 1+7 configuration of ribonucleoprotein complexes for influenza A virus genome packaging.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome is composed of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNAs. Eight distinct viral RNA segments (vRNAs) are selectively packaged into progeny virions, with eight vRNAs in ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) arranged in a specific "1+7" pattern, that is, one central RNP surrounded by seven RNPs. Here we report the genome packaging of an artificially generated seven-segment virus that lacks the hemagglutinin (HA) vRNA. Electron microscopy shows that, even in the presence of only seven vRNAs, the virions efficiently package eight RNPs arranged in the same "1+7" pattern as wild-type virions. Next-generation sequencing reveals that the virions specifically incorporate host-derived 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) seemingly as the eighth RNP in place of the HA vRNA. These findings highlight the importance of the assembly of eight RNPs into a specific "1+7" configuration for genome packaging in progeny virions and suggest a potential role for cellular RNAs in viral genome packaging.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the structural configuration of ribonucleoprotein complexes in influenza A virus genome packaging, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Harnessing an RNA-mediated chaperone for the assembly of influenza hemagglutinin in an immunologically relevant conformation.
Abstract: A novel protein-folding function of RNA has been recognized, which can outperform previously known molecular chaperone proteins. The RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes and is operational during viral infections. Our purpose was to test whether influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation by means of an RNA molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity. An RNA-interacting domain (RID) from the host being immunized was selected as a docking tag for RNA binding, which served as a transducer for the chaperna function for de novo folding and trimeric assembly of RID-HA1. Mutations that affect tRNA binding greatly increased the soluble aggregation defective in trimer assembly, suggesting that RNA interaction critically controls the kinetic network in the folding/assembly pathway. Immunization of mice resulted in strong hemagglutination inhibition and high titers of a neutralizing antibody, providing sterile protection against a lethal challenge and confirming the immunologically relevant HA conformation. The results may be translated into a rapid response to a new influenza pandemic. The harnessing of the novel chaperna described herein with immunologically tailored antigen-folding functions should serve as a robust prophylactic and diagnostic tool for viral infections.-Yang, S.

Title: Anti-pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus potential of catechin and gallic acid.
Abstract: The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread worldwide and infected a large proportion of the human population. Discovery of new and effective drugs for the treatment of influenza is a crucial issue for the global medical community. According to our previous study, TSL-1, a fraction of the aqueous extract from the tender leaf of Toonasinensis, has demonstrated antiviral activities against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through the down-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine to prevent viral attachment. The aim of the present study was to identify the active compounds in TSL-1 which exert anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus effects. XTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect on the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was analyzed by observing plaque formation, qRT-PCR, neuraminidase activity, and immunofluorescence staining of influenza A-specific glycoprotein. Both catechin and gallic acid were found to be potent inhibitors in terms of influenza virus mRNA replication and MDCK plaque formation. Additionally, both compounds inhibited neuraminidase activities and viral glycoprotein. The 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of catechin and gallic acid for the influenza A (H1N1) virus were 18.4 μg/mL and 2.6 μg/mL, respectively; whereas the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC<sub>50</sub>) of catechin and gallic acid were >100 μg/mL and 22.1 μg/mL, respectively. Thus, the selectivity indexes (SI) of catechin and gallic acid were >5.6 and 22.1, respectively. The present study demonstrates that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection. We conclude that these two phyto-chemicals in TSL-1 are responsible for exerting anti-pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus effects.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates antiviral effects of catechin and gallic acid on influenza A (H1N1) virus, focusing on drug activity rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Histone demethylase LSD1 restricts influenza A virus infection by erasing IFITM3-K88 monomethylation.
Abstract: The histone demethylase LSD1 has been known as a key transcriptional coactivator for DNA viruses such as herpes virus. Inhibition of LSD1 was found to block viral genome transcription and lytic replication of DNA viruses. However, RNA virus genomes do not rely on chromatin structure and histone association, and the role of demethylase activity of LSD1 in RNA virus infections is not anticipated. Here, we identify that, contrary to its role in enhancing DNA virus replication, LSD1 limits RNA virus replication by demethylating and activating IFITM3 which is a host restriction factor for many RNA viruses. We have found that LSD1 is recruited to demethylate IFITM3 at position K88 under IFNα treatment. However, infection by either Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) or Influenza A Virus (IAV) triggers methylation of IFITM3 by promoting its disassociation from LSD1. Accordingly, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of LSD1 by Trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride (TCP) increases IFITM3 monomethylation which leads to more severe disease outcomes in IAV-infected mice. In summary, our findings highlight the opposite role of LSD1 in fighting RNA viruses comparing to DNA viruses infection. Our data suggest that the demethylation of IFITM3 by LSD1 is beneficial for the host to fight against RNA virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies host factor LSD1's role in restricting influenza virus infection, focusing on host-virus interaction rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Disordered oropharyngeal microbial communities in H7N9 patients with or without secondary bacterial lung infection.
Abstract: Secondary bacterial lung infection (SBLI) is a serious complication in patients with H7N9 virus infection, and increases disease severity. The oropharyngeal (OP) microbiome helps prevent colonisation of respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the OP microbiome of H7N9 patients with/without secondary bacterial pneumonia using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. OP swab samples were collected from 51 H7N9 patients (21 with SBLI and 30 without) and 30 matched healthy controls (HCs) and used for comparative composition, diversity and richness analyses of microbial communities. Principal coordinates analysis successfully distinguished between the OP microbiomes of H7N9 patients and healthy subjects, and the OP microbiome diversity of patients with SBLI was significantly increased. There was significant dysbiosis of the OP microbiome in H7N9 patients, with an abundance of Leptotrichia, Oribacterium, Streptococcus, Atopobium, Eubacterium, Solobacterium and Rothia species in patients with SBLI, and Filifactor, Megasphaera and Leptotrichia species in patients without SBLI, when compared with HCs. Importantly, Haemophilus and Bacteroides species were enriched in HCs. These findings revealed dysbiosis of the OP microbiota in H7N9 patients, and identified OP microbial risk indicators of SBLI, suggesting that the OP microbiome could provide novel and non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for early microbiota-targeted prophylactic therapies for SBLI prevention.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes oropharyngeal microbiome changes in H7N9 patients, focusing on bacterial communities rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Stress Granule-Inducing Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4A Inhibitors Block Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) is a helicase that facilitates assembly of the translation preinitiation complex by unwinding structured mRNA 5' untranslated regions. Pateamine A (PatA) and silvestrol are natural products that disrupt eIF4A function and arrest translation, thereby triggering the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled preinitiation complexes known as stress granules (SGs). Here we examined the effects of eIF4A inhibition by PatA and silvestrol on influenza A virus (IAV) protein synthesis and replication in cell culture. Treatment of infected cells with either PatA or silvestrol at early times post-infection resulted in SG formation, arrest of viral protein synthesis and failure to replicate the viral genome. PatA, which irreversibly binds to eIF4A, sustained long-term blockade of IAV replication following drug withdrawal, and inhibited IAV replication at concentrations that had minimal cytotoxicity. By contrast, the antiviral effects of silvestrol were fully reversible; drug withdrawal caused rapid SG dissolution and resumption of viral protein synthesis. IAV inhibition by silvestrol was invariably associated with cytotoxicity. PatA blocked replication of genetically divergent IAV strains, suggesting common dependence on host eIF4A activity. This study demonstrates that the core host protein synthesis machinery can be targeted to block viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host translation initiation factor inhibitors blocking influenza virus replication, focusing on host-targeted antiviral mechanisms rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Inhibition of neddylation pathway represses influenza virus replication and pro-inflammatory responses.
Abstract: The neddylation pathway belongs post-translational modifications and plays important roles in regulating viral infection and replication. To address the relationship of influenza A virus with the neddylation modification pathway, we demonstrate that IAV infection in A549 cells can activate the neddylation modification pathway to increase virus growth and enhance the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines to increase pathogenicity. The pre-treatment of Nedd8-activating enzyme subunit 1 (NAE1)-specific inhibitor, MLN4924, interferes with Nedd8 conjugation and NF-κB activity. MLN4924 exhibited pronounced antiviral activity against different subtypes of influenza A virus, including classical H1N1 (PR8), H9N2 subtype, and pandemic H1N1 2009 (pdmH1N1) viruses. Through the inhibition of the CRL/NF-κB pathway, MLN4924 could significantly suppress the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by IAVs. These findings suggest that MLN4924 can be developed as a novel antiviral therapy for influenza infection for anti-viral efficacy and anti-inflammation activity.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States, October 1-November 25, 2017.
Abstract: Influenza activity in the United States was low during October 2017, but has been increasing since the beginning of November. Influenza A viruses have been most commonly identified, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Several influenza activity indicators were higher than is typically seen for this time of year. The majority of influenza viruses characterized during this period were genetically or antigenically similar to the 2017-18 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine reference viruses. These data indicate that currently circulating viruses have not undergone significant antigenic drift; however, circulating A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically less similar to egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses used for producing the majority of influenza vaccines in the United States. It is difficult to predict which influenza viruses will predominate in the 2017-18 influenza season; however, in recent past seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, hospitalizations and deaths were more common, and the effectiveness of the vaccine was lower. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Multiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended for use during the 2017-18 season, and vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 1-November 25, 2017 (surveillance weeks 40-47).<sup>†</sup>.

Reason: This is a surveillance report describing influenza activity and genetic similarity to vaccine strains without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage analysis.

Title: Characterization of Influenza Virus Pseudotyped with Ebolavirus Glycoprotein.
Abstract: We have produced a new Ebola virus pseudotype, E-S-FLU, that can be handled in biosafety level 1/2 containment for laboratory analysis. The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC<sup>1280</sup>; Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Ebola virus is in the <i>Filoviridae</i> family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes an influenza virus pseudotype with Ebola glycoprotein for screening inhibitors, focusing on methodology rather than genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Cell culture-based production of defective interfering particles for influenza antiviral therapy.
Abstract: Defective interfering particles (DIPs) lack an essential portion of the virus genome, but retain signals for replication and packaging, and therefore, interfere with standard virus (STV) replication. Due to this property, DIPs can be potential antivirals. The influenza A virus DIP DI244, generated during propagation in chicken eggs, has been previously described as a potential candidate for influenza antiviral therapy. As a cell culture-based manufacturing process would be more suitable to fulfill large-scale production needs of an antiviral and enables full process control in closed systems, we investigated options to produce DI244 in the avian cell line AGE1.CR.pIX in chemically defined suspension culture. With a DI244 fraction of 55.8% compared to STV, the highest DI244 yield obtained from 50 million cells was 4.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> vRNA copies/mL at 12 h post infection. However, other defective genomes were also detected. Since these additionally produced defective particles are non-infectious, they might be still useful in antiviral therapies. In case they would interfere with quality of the final product, we examined the impact of virus seeds and selected process parameters on DI244 yield and contamination level with other defective particles. With a DI244 fraction of 5.5%, the yield obtained was 1.7 × 10<sup>8</sup> vRNA copies/mL but now without additional defective genomes. Although the DI244 yield might be decreased in this case, such controlled manufacturing conditions are not available in chicken eggs. Overall, the application of these findings can support design and optimization of a cell culture-based production process for DIPs to be used as antivirals.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on production of defective interfering particles for antiviral therapy, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage analysis.

Title: Molecular detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with M genes from human pandemic strains among Nigerian pigs, 2013-2015: implications and associated risk factors.
Abstract: In the post-pandemic period, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been detected in swine populations in different parts of the world. This study was conducted to determine the presence and spatial patterns of this human pandemic virus among Nigerian pigs and identify associated risk factors. Using a two-stage stratified random sampling method, nasal swab specimens were obtained from pigs in Ibadan, Nigeria during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons, and the virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Purified RT-PCR products were sequenced in both directions, and sequences were aligned using MUSCLE. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA6. Purely spatial scan statistics and a spatial lag regression model were used to identify spatial clusters and associated risk factors. The virus was detected in both seasons, with an overall prevalence of 8·7%. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the M genes were similar to those of pandemic strains which circulated in humans prior to and during the study. Cluster analysis revealed a significant primary spatial cluster (RR = 4·71, LLR = 5·66, P = 0·0046), while 'hours spent with pigs (R 2 = 0·90, P = 0·0018)' and 'hours spent with pigs from different farms (R 2 = 0·91, P = 0·0001)' were identified as significant risk factors (P < 0·05). These findings reveal that there is considerable risk of transmission of the pandemic virus, either directly from pig handlers or through fomites, to swine herds in Ibadan, Nigeria. Active circulation of the virus among Nigerian pigs could enhance its reassortment with endemic swine influenza viruses. Campaigns for adoption of biosecurity measures in West African piggeries and abattoirs should be introduced and sustained in order to prevent the emergence of a new influenza epicentre in the sub-region.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on molecular detection and phylogenetic analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in pigs, with no explicit link between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus segment 5 (+)RNA - secondary structure and new targets for antiviral strategies.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a threat for humans due to seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. This virus can generate new strains that are dangerous through nucleotide/amino acid changes or through segmental recombination of the viral RNA genome. It is important to gain wider knowledge about influenza virus RNA to create new strategies for drugs that will inhibit its spread. Here, we present the experimentally determined secondary structure of the influenza segment 5 (+)RNA. Two RNAs were studied: the full-length segment 5 (+)RNA and a shorter construct containing only the coding region. Chemical mapping data combined with thermodynamic energy minimization were used in secondary structure prediction. Sequence/structure analysis showed that the determined secondary structure of segment 5 (+)RNA is mostly conserved between influenza virus type A strains. Microarray mapping and RNase H cleavage identified accessible sites for oligonucleotides in the revealed secondary structure of segment 5 (+)RNA. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed based on the secondary structure model and tested against influenza virus in cell culture. Inhibition of influenza virus proliferation was noticed, identifying good targets for antisense strategies. Effective target sites fall within two domains, which are conserved in sequence/structure indicating their importance to the virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on RNA secondary structure and antiviral target identification without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Autophagy activation is required for influenza A virus-induced apoptosis and replication.
Abstract: Autophagy and apoptosis are two major interconnected host cell responses to viral infection, including influenza A virus (IAV). Thus, delineating these events could facilitate the development of better treatment options and provide an effective anti-viral strategy for controlling IAV infection. We used A549 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to study the role of virus-induced autophagy and apoptosis, the cross-talk between both pathways, and their relation to IAV infection [ATCC strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (hereafter; PR8)]. PR8-infected and mock-infected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS). We found that PR8 infection simultaneously induced autophagy and apoptosis in A549 cells. Autophagy was associated with Bax and Bak activation, intrinsic caspase cleavage and subsequent PARP-1 and BID cleavage. Both Bax knockout (KO) and Bax/Bak double knockout MEFs displayed inhibition of virus-induced cytopathology and cell death and diminished virus-mediated caspase activation, suggesting that virus-induced apoptosis is Bax/Bak-dependent. Biochemical inhibition of autophagy induction with 3-methyladenine blocked both virus replication and apoptosis pathways. These effects were replicated using autophagy-refractory Atg3 KO and Atg5 KO cells. Taken together, our data indicate that PR8 infection simultaneously induces autophagy and Bax/caspase-dependent apoptosis, with autophagy playing a role to support PR8 replication, in part, by modulating virus-induced apoptosis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies host cell responses (autophagy and apoptosis) to influenza infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular epidemiology of swine influenza A viruses in the Southeastern United States, highlights regional differences in circulating strains.
Abstract: Swine influenza A virus (IAV) can cause widespread respiratory disease with high morbidity, low mortality, and have a substantial economic impact to the swine industry. Swine infection may contribute to pandemic IAV given their susceptibility to both avian and human IAVs. Currently, three IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2) circulate in swine in North America frequently combining gene segments from avian or human viruses. This study investigated the prevalence of IAV in commercial swine herds. A total of 1878 oral fluid samples were collected from pigs of all ages from 201 commercial farms located in North Carolina and South Carolina. Sixty-eight oral fluid samples from 35 farms were positive by MP gene PCR with an overall IAV-positivity of 3.6%. On the herd level, the percentage of IAV positivity was 17.4%. Fifty-six viruses were subtyped, while 12 were partly subtyped or not subtyped at all. Using de novo assembly, complete sequences were obtained for 59 HA genes. The majority of IAVs subtyped had an H1 HA demonstrating a considerable prevalence over H3 viruses. Furthermore, only six out of eleven HA types were detected which has implications for the selection of vaccines used by swine producers in the region.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports molecular epidemiology and prevalence of swine influenza viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Oroxylin A suppresses influenza A virus replication correlating with neuraminidase inhibition and induction of IFNs.
Abstract: Because it is highly contagious, the influenza A virus (IAV) has the potential to cause pandemics in humans. The emergence of drug-resistant strains requires the development of new chemical therapeutics. Oroxylin A (OA) is a flavonoid which has been shown to have antioxidant and antitumor effects. However, intensive studies in which OA fights against different influenza virus strains and the underlying antiviral mechanisms have not been reported. In our study, the antiviral activities in cells and in mice, the preliminary mechanisms of OA were investigated. Our data show that it can inhibit A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and oseltamivir-resistant A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) viruses in MDCK cells in a dose-dependent manner with inhibitory rates of 70.9%, 59.5% and 23.2%, respectively, at 50μM doses. Orally administered OA effectively protected mice from H1N1 virus-induced death, body weight loss and lung injury, with a survival rate of 60.0% at 100mg/kg/d dose. In addition, the H1N1 M1 gene transcription and protein synthesis were suppressed by 43.7% and 33.2%, respectively, in the late biosynthesis stage. This resulted in inhibition of viral replication. Furthermore, we found that OA has a neuraminidase (NA) inhibitory effect with IC<sub>50</sub> values for H1N1-H275Y and A/Anhui/1/2013-R294K (H7N9-R294K) of 241.4μM and 203.6μM, respectively. Interferons (IFNs) produced by the virally infected cells play important roles in antiviral defense, therefore, IFN levels in the blood were also tested in mice. We found that IFN-β and IFN-γ in the OA 100mg/kg/d group were markedly increased by 24.5pg/mL and 859.9pg/mL, respectively, compared with those in the model group. This indicated that OA could induce the secretion of IFNs. The potent inhibition of virus replication and NA inhibitory activity, as well as the promotion of IFN production suggest that OA could be a drug candidate to fight against IAVs including oseltamivir-resistant strains.

Title: Identification and function analysis of canine stimulator of interferon gene (STING).
Abstract: Stimulator of interferon gene (STING) plays an important role in the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-mediated activation of type I IFN responses. In this study, we identified and cloned canine STING gene. Full-length STING encodes a 375 amino acid product that shares the highest similarity with feline STING. Highest levels of mRNA of canine STING were detected in the spleen and lungs while the lowest levels in the heart and muscle. Analysis of its cellular localization showed that STING is localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. STING overexpression induced the IFN response via the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways and up-regulated the expression of ISG15 and viperin. However, knockdown of STING did not inhibit the IFN-β response triggered by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), or SeV. Finally, overexpression of STING significantly inhibited the replication of canine influenza virus H3N2. Collectively, our findings indicate that STING is involved in the regulation of the IFN-β pathway in canine.

Reason: The paper characterizes canine STING and its role in interferon response and inhibition of canine influenza virus replication but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Soloxolone methyl inhibits influenza virus replication and reduces virus-induced lung inflammation.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic influenza viruses pose a serious public health threat to humans. Although vaccines are available, new antivirals are needed to efficiently control disease progression and virus transmission due to the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. In this study, we describe the anti-viral properties of Soloxolone methyl (SM) (methyl 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-18βH-olean-9(11),1(2)-dien-30-oate, a chemical derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid) against the flu virus. Anti-flu efficacy studies revealed that SM exhibits antiviral activity against the H1N1 influenza A virus in a dose-dependent manner causing a more than 10-fold decrease in virus titer and a reduction in the expression of NP and M2 viral proteins. In a time-of-addition study, SM was found to act at an early stage of infection to exhibit an inhibitory effect on both the attachment step and virus uptake into cells. Also, in infected cells SM downregulates the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. In infected mice, SM administered intranasally prior to and after infection significantly decreases virus titers in the lung and prevents post-challenge pneumonia. Together, these results suggest that Soloxolone methyl might serve as an effective therapeutic agent to manage influenza outbreaks and virus-associated complications, and further preclinical and clinical investigation may be warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes antiviral activity of Soloxolone methyl against influenza virus and its effects on viral replication and inflammation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Epithelial-derived TGF-β1 acts as a pro-viral factor in the lung during influenza A infection.
Abstract: Mucosal surfaces are under constant bombardment from potentially antigenic particles and so must maintain a balance between homeostasis and inappropriate immune activation and consequent pathology. Epithelial cells have a vital role orchestrating pulmonary homeostasis and defense against pathogens. TGF-β regulates an array of immune responses-both inflammatory and regulatory-however, its function is highly location- and context-dependent. We demonstrate that epithelial-derived TGF-β acts as a pro-viral factor suppressing early immune responses during influenza A infection. Mice specifically lacking bronchial epithelial TGF-β1 (epTGFβKO) displayed marked protection from influenza-induced weight loss, airway inflammation, and pathology. However, protection from influenza-induced pathology was not associated with a heightened lymphocytic immune response. In contrast, the kinetics of interferon beta (IFNβ) release into the airways was significantly enhanced in epTGFβKO mice compared with control mice, with elevated IFNβ on day 1 in epTGFβKO compared with control mice. This induced a heighted antiviral state resulting in impaired viral replication in epTGFβKO mice. Thus, epithelial-derived TGF-β acts to suppress early IFNβ responses leading to increased viral burden and pathology. This study demonstrates the importance of the local epithelial microenvironmental niche in shaping initial immune responses to viral infection and controlling host disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of epithelial-derived TGF-β1 in modulating immune response and viral replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Spatio-temporal pattern analysis for evaluation of the spread of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, 2013-2014.
Abstract: A large number (n = 460) of A(H7N9) human infections have been reported in China from March 2013 through December 2014, and H7N9 outbreaks in humans became an emerging issue for China health, which have caused numerous disease outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild bird populations, and threatened human health severely. The aims of this study were to investigate the directional trend of the epidemic and to identify the significant presence of spatial-temporal clustering of influenza A(H7N9) human cases between March 2013 and December 2014. Three distinct epidemic phases of A(H7N9) human infections were identified in this study. In each phase, standard deviational ellipse analysis was conducted to examine the directional trend of disease spreading, and retrospective space-time permutation scan statistic was then used to identify the spatio-temporal cluster patterns of H7N9 outbreaks in humans. The ever-changing location and the increasing size of the three identified standard deviational ellipses showed that the epidemic moved from east to southeast coast, and hence to some central regions, with a future epidemiological trend of continue dispersing to more central regions of China, and a few new human cases might also appear in parts of the western China. Furthermore, A(H7N9) human infections were clustering in space and time in the first two phases with five significant spatio-temporal clusters (p < 0.05), but there was no significant cluster identified in phase III. There was a new epidemiologic pattern that the decrease in significant spatio-temporal cluster of A(H7N9) human infections was accompanied with an obvious spatial expansion of the outbreaks during the study period, and identification of the spatio-temporal patterns of the epidemic can provide valuable insights for better understanding the spreading dynamics of the disease in China.

Title: Preparation and evaluation of a novel, live, attenuated influenza H1N1 vaccine strain produced by a modified classical reassortment method.
Abstract: Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)-based Vero cells could provide a better choice to control and prevent influenza virus infections. This study used the human influenza virus A/Yunnan/1/2005Vca(H3N2) (YN/05Vca) as a donor strain. YN/05Vca has a double phenotype of cold adaption (ca) and Vero cell adaption (va). The parental virus strain used was the wild-type A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1) (SI/06wt). The study employed the modified classical reassortment method to generate a new virus strain. After co-infection of Vero cells, some different sub-types of the reassorted viruses were generated randomly. Then, the specific anti-serum (anti-YN/05Vca) could combine with and neutralize the donor virus, and the original parental virus could not grow in Vero cells at a low temperature until it was re-structured with the meaningful gene fragment from the donor virus in Vero cells. According to the plaques and RT-PCR results, a new monoclonal strain of Vero cell cold adaption virus was screened: SI/06Vca. After immunological and biological identification, this new strain virus could be used as a seed bank for LAIV, which has maintained surface antigenicity with SI/06wt. Consequently, this new Vero cell cold adaption virus SI/06Vca could be used for large-scale vaccine production with sufficient safety and efficacy, as confirmed by animal experiments with mice and ferrets.

Title: Emodin Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication and Influenza Viral Pneumonia via the Nrf2, TLR4, p38/JNK and NF-kappaB Pathways.
Abstract: Lasting activations of toll-like receptors (TLRs), MAPK and NF-κB pathways can support influenza A virus (IAV) infection and promote pneumonia. In this study, we have investigated the effect and mechanism of action of emodin on IAV infection using qRT-PCR, western blotting, ELISA, Nrf2 luciferase reporter, siRNA and plaque inhibition assays. The results showed that emodin could significantly inhibit IAV (ST169, H1N1) replication, reduce IAV-induced expressions of TLR2/3/4/7, MyD88 and TRAF6, decrease IAV-induced phosphorylations of p38/JNK MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Emodin also activated the Nrf2 pathway, decreased ROS levels, increased GSH levelss and GSH/GSSG ratio, and upregulated the activities of SOD, GR, CAT and GSH-Px after IAV infection. Suppression of Nrf2 via siRNA markedly blocked the inhibitory effects of emodin on IAV-induced activations of TLR4, p38/JNK, and NF-κB pathways and on IAV-induced production of IL-1β, IL-6 and expression of IAV M2 protein. Emodin also dramatically increased the survival rate of mice, reduced lung edema, pulmonary viral titer and inflammatory cytokines, and improved lung histopathological changes. In conclusion, emodin can inhibit IAV replication and influenza viral pneumonia, at least in part, by activating Nrf2 signaling and inhibiting IAV-induced activations of the TLR4, p38/JNK MAPK and NF-κB pathways.

Title: Pathogenicity and immunosuppressive potential of fowl adenovirus in specific pathogen free chickens.
Abstract: To elucidate the effect of fowl adenovirus (FAdV)-C in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, we investigated the pathogenicity, body weights, enzymatic systems, and immune organs of chickens in response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and avian influenza virus subtype H9 (AIV-H9) vaccination. Chickens were divided randomly into four groups, which included injection groups (FAdV-C, vaccination, and FAdV-C plus vaccination) and a negative control group. The results indicated that FAdV-C was highly pathogenic in SPF chickens and led to a 40% mortality rate and growth retardation, compared with the control birds. Significant changes in clinical chemical markers of all infected birds, together with histopathological lesions, indicated impairment of the liver and heart integrity and function. Furthermore, chickens in the FAdV-C plus vaccination group had significantly lower titers of antibodies against NDV and AIV-H9 than the uninfected and vaccinated chickens. The results of this study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of hydropericardium syndrome, a disease that progresses to a metabolic disorder and causes serious growth retardation and immunosuppression.

Title: MicroRNA-302a suppresses influenza A virus-stimulated interferon regulatory factor-5 expression and cytokine storm induction.
Abstract: During influenza A virus (IAV) infection, cytokine storms play a vital and critical role in clinical outcomes. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-302c regulates IAV-induced IFN expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase. In the current study, we found that miR-302a, another member of the miR-302 cluster, controls the IAV-induced cytokine storm. According to results from cell-based and knockout mouse models, IAV induces a cytokine storm via interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF-5). We also found that IAV infection up-regulates IRF-5 expression and that IRF-5 in turn promotes IAV replication. Furthermore, we observed that IRF-5 is a direct target of miR-302a, which down-regulated IRF-5 expression by binding its 3'-UTR. Moreover, IAV increased IRF-5 expression by down-regulating miR-302a expression. Interestingly, miR-302a inhibited IAV replication. In IAV-infected patients, miR-302a expression was down-regulated, whereas IRF-5 expression was up-regulated. Taken together, our work uncovers and defines a signaling pathway implicated in an IAV-induced cytokine storm.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on microRNA regulation of host immune response and cytokine storm during influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Pterodontic Acid Isolated from Laggera pterodonta Inhibits Viral Replication and Inflammation Induced by Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: <i>Laggera pterodonta</i> (DC.) Benth. is a traditional Chinese medicine. The previous study revealed that the crude extracts of this herb could inhibit influenza virus infection, but its anti-influenza components and underlying mechanism of action remain unknown. Column chromatography was performed to isolate components from the plant. Activity against influenza virus of the compound was determined by CPE inhibition assay. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition was measured by chemiluminescence assay. The anti-virus and anti-inflammation effects were determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and luminex assay. Pterodontic acid was isolated from <i>L. pterodonta</i>, which showed selective anti-viral activities to H1 subtype of human influenza A virus. Meanwhile, the NA activity was not obviously inhibited by the compound. Further experiments exhibited that the compound can suppress the activation of NF-κB signal pathway and export of viral RNP complexes from the nucleus. In addition, it can significantly attenuate expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules IL-6, MIP-1β, MCP-1, and IP-10 induced by human influenza A virus (H1N1) and similarly downregulate expression of cytokines and chemokines induced by avian influenza A virus (H9N2). This study showed that in vitro antiviral activity of pterodontic acid is most probably associated with inhibiting the replication of influenza A virus by blocking nuclear export of viral RNP complexes, and attenuating the inflammatory response by inhibiting activation of the NF-κB pathway. Pterodontic acid might be a potential antiviral agent against influenza A virus.

Title: The Lethal Spanish Influenza Pandemic in Poland.
Abstract: The Spanish influenza pandemic in the years 1918-1920 was the largest and most tragic pandemic of infectious disease in human history. Deciphering the structure of the virus (including the determination of complete genome sequence) of this pandemic and the phylogenetic analysis and explanation of its virulence became possible thanks to molecular genetic analysis of the virus isolated from the fixed and frozen lung tissue of influenza victims who died in 1918 and were buried frozen in Alaska and Spitsbergen. Epidemiological data from the course of this pandemic in Poland have not been previously published. For analysis, we used source materials such as clinical studies and case reports of doctors fighting against the pandemic and registries of influenza cases in units of the Polish Army and military hospitals. Clinically, the pandemic of 1918 was characterized by the same symptoms and course as influenza in other years. Pathologically, the disease was similar to the other pandemic, in that the destruction was mostly limited to the respiratory tract. The "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 took place in Poland in 3 epidemic waves. The peaks of morbidity and mortality occurred in the capital, Warsaw, in December 1918 and in December 1919 to January 1920. It is estimated that throughout the pandemic period of 1918-1920 in Poland, 200 000 to 300 000 people died.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a historical epidemiological review of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: The susceptibility of circulating human influenza viruses to tizoxanide, the active metabolite of nitazoxanide.
Abstract: Nitazoxanide is a thiazolide compound that was originally developed as an anti-parasitic agent, but has recently been repurposed for the treatment of influenza virus infections. Thought to exert its anti-influenza activity via the inhibition of hemagglutinin maturation and intracellular trafficking in infected cells, the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in treating patients with non-complicated influenza is currently being assessed in phase III clinical trials. Here, we describe the susceptibility of 210 seasonal influenza viruses to tizoxanide, the active circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide. An optimised cell culture-based focus reduction assay was used to determine the susceptibility of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in the southern hemisphere from the period March 2014 to August 2016. Tizoxanide showed potent in vitro antiviral activity against all influenza viruses tested, including neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses, allowing the establishment of a baseline level of susceptibility for each subtype. Median EC<sub>50</sub> values (±IQR) of 0.48 μM (0.33-0.71), 0.62 μM (0.56-0.75), 0.66 μM (0.62-0.69), and 0.60 μM (0.51-0.67) were obtained for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B(Victoria lineage), and B(Yamagata lineage) influenza viruses respectively. There was no significant difference in the median baseline tizoxanide susceptibility for each influenza subtype tested. This is the first report on the susceptibility of circulating viruses to tizoxanide. The focus reduction assay format described is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than traditional cell based antiviral assays, making it highly suitable for the surveillance of tizoxanide susceptibility in circulating seasonal influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper assesses susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to an antiviral drug but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: ATP catabolism by tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase contributes to development of ARDS in influenza-infected mice.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are highly contagious respiratory pathogens that are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide on an annual basis. We have shown previously that influenza infection of mice leads to increased ATP and adenosine accumulation in the airway lumen. Moreover, we demonstrated that A<sub>1</sub>-adenosine receptor activation contributes significantly to influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, we found that development of ARDS in influenza-infected mice does not require catabolism of ATP to adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Hence, we hypothesized that increased adenosine generation in response to infection is mediated by tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which is a low-affinity, high-capacity enzyme that catabolizes nucleotides in a nonspecific manner. In the current study, we found that whole lung and BALF TNAP expression and alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity increased as early as 2 days postinfection (dpi) of C57BL/6 mice with 10,000 pfu/mouse of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Treatment at 2 and 4 dpi with a highly specific quinolinyl-benzenesulfonamide TNAP inhibitor (TNAPi) significantly reduced whole lung alkaline phosphatase activity at 6 dpi but did not alter TNAP gene or protein expression. TNAPi treatment attenuated hypoxemia, lung dysfunction, histopathology, and pulmonary edema at 6 dpi without impacting viral replication or BALF adenosine. Treatment also improved epithelial barrier function and attenuated cellular and humoral immune responses to influenza infection. These data indicate that TNAP inhibition can attenuate influenza-induced ARDS by reducing inflammation and fluid accumulation within the lung. They also further emphasize the importance of adenosine generation for development of ARDS in influenza-infected mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host enzyme activity and its role in influenza-induced ARDS, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian H5N8 influenza viruses: should we be concerned?
Abstract: Avian influenza A viruses pose a constant threat to global human health as sporadic infections continue to occur with associated high mortality rates. To date, a number of avian influenza virus subtypes have infected humans, including H5N1, H7N9, H9N2 and H7N7. The majority of 'bird flu' cases are thought to have arisen from direct contact with infected poultry, particularly in live markets in Asia. <sup>1</sup> While human cases of the H5N8 subtype have not been documented as yet, there is the potential that H5N8 viruses could acquire mutations which favour infection of human cells. There is also the possibility that novel viruses with a tropism for human cells could be generated if H5N8 should reassasort with other circulating avian viruses, such as those of the H5N1 subtype. The emergence of a novel H5N8 virus with the capability of infecting humans could have drastic consequences to global health.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing potential human infection risks of H5N8 viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: In vitro Anti-Influenza Virus Activity of Agaricus brasiliensis KA21.
Abstract: 　Agaricus is known to have immunostimulatory and anti-tumor effects. However, the antiviral effects of Agaricus have not yet been examined. In the present study, the antiviral effects of an extract of Agaricus brasiliensis KA21 (AE) on the H1N1 influenza virus (PR8 strain) were investigated.　The anti-influenza virus effects of AE were examined by using the plaque formation inhibition test. AE inhibited the plaque formation of PR8 in a dose-dependent manner: 98 and 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) inhibition at 2.5 and 0.99 mg/mL, respectively. To elucidate the mechanisms of AE, the direct actions and adsorption and invasion inhibition of AE were examined, and were found to have no inhibitory effect on PR8 infection. Thus, in vitro antiviral effects may somehow inhibit PR8 after the viral invasion of cells. These results demonstrated that it is expected that AE can effectively prevent the spread of the influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper examines antiviral effects of a mushroom extract on influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: [Impact of Delivery Method on Antiviral Activity of Phosphodiester, Phosphorothioate, and Phosphoryl Guanidine Oligonucleotides in MDCK Cells Infected with H5N1 Bird Flu Virus].
Abstract: We have previously described nanocomposites containing conjugates or complexes of native oligodeoxyribonucleotides with poly-L-lysine and TiO2 nanoparticles. We have shown that these nanocomposites efficiently suppressed influenza A virus reproduction in MDCK cells. Here, we have synthesized previously undescribed nanocomposites that consist of TiO2 nanoparticles and polylysine conjugates with oligonucleotides that contain phosphoryl guanidine or phosphorothioate internucleotide groups. These nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity in MDCK cells infected with H5N1 influenza A virus. The nanocomposites containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides inhibited virus replication ~130-fold. More potent inhibition, i.e., ~5000-fold or ~4600-fold, has been demonstrated by nanocomposites that contain phosphoryl guanidine or phosphodiester oligonucleotides, respectively. Free oligonucleotides have been nearly inactive. The antiviral activity of oligonucleotides of all three types, when delivered by Lipofectamine, has been significantly lower compared to the oligonucleotides delivered in the nanocomposites. In the former case, the phosphoryl guanidine oligonucleotide has appeared to be the most efficient; it has inhibited the virus replication by a factor of 400. The results make it possible to consider phosphoryl guanidine oligonucleotides, along with other oligonucleotide derivatives, as potential antiviral agents against H5N1 avian flu virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral activity of oligonucleotide nanocomposites against H5N1 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza annual report, 2015.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a total of 5,557 influenza positive samples during 2015. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. In 2015, influenza B viruses predominated over influenza A(H1)pdm09 and A(H3) viruses, accounting for a total of 58% of all viruses analysed. The vast majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2015. However, phylogenetic analysis of a selection of viruses indicated that the majority of circulating A(H3) viruses were genetically distinct from the WHO recommended strain for 2015, resulting in an update to the recommended vaccine strain for the Southern Hemisphere for 2016. With an increasing predominance of B/Victoria lineage viruses over B/Yamagata lineage viruses through the course of 2015, WHO also updated the recommended influenza B strain in the trivalent influenza vaccine for 2016. Of more than 3,300 samples tested for resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, only 1 A(H1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. The Centre undertook primary isolation of candidate vaccine viruses directly into eggs, and in 2015 a total of 45 viruses were successfully isolated in eggs.

Title: Five distinct reassortants of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses affected Japan during the winter of 2016-2017.
Abstract: To elucidate the evolutionary pathway, we sequenced the entire genomes of 89 H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated in Japan during winter 2016-2017 and 117 AIV/HPAIVs isolated in Japan and Russia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that at least 5 distinct genotypes of H5N6 HPAIVs affected poultry and wild birds during that period. Japanese H5N6 isolates shared a common genetic ancestor in 6 of 8 genomic segments, and the PA and NS genes demonstrated 4 and 2 genetic origins, respectively. Six gene segments originated from a putative ancestral clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 virus that was a possible genetic reassortant among Chinese clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs. In addition, 2 NS clusters and a PA cluster in Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs originated from Chinese HPAIVs, whereas 3 distinct AIV-derived PA clusters were evident. These results suggest that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversification of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs.

Title: Chemical Genomics Approach Leads to the Identification of Hesperadin, an Aurora B Kinase Inhibitor, as a Broad-Spectrum Influenza Antiviral.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens that are responsible for annual influenza epidemics and sporadic influenza pandemics. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu<sup>®</sup>) is currently the only FDA-approved oral drug that is available for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. However, its narrow therapeutic window, coupled with the increasing incidence of drug resistance, calls for the next generation of influenza antivirals. In this study, we discovered hesperadin, an aurora B kinase inhibitor, as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral through forward chemical genomics screening. Hesperadin inhibits multiple human clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses with single to submicromolar efficacy, including oseltamivir-resistant strains. Mechanistic studies revealed that hesperadin inhibits the early stage of viral replication by delaying the nuclear entry of viral ribonucleoprotein complex, thereby inhibiting viral RNA transcription and translation as well as viral protein synthesis. Moreover, a combination of hesperadin with oseltamivir shows synergistic antiviral activity, therefore hesperadin can be used either alone to treat infections by oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses or used in combination with oseltamivir to delay resistance evolution among oseltamivir-sensitive strains. In summary, the discovery of hesperadin as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral offers an alternative to combat future influenza epidemics and pandemics.

Title: Influenza virus replication in macrophages: balancing protection and pathogenesis.
Abstract: Macrophages are essential for protection against influenza A virus infection, but are also implicated in the morbidity and mortality associated with severe influenza disease, particularly during infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. While influenza virus infection of macrophages was once thought to be abortive, it is now clear that certain virus strains can replicate productively in macrophages. This may have important consequences for the antiviral functions of macrophages, the course of disease and the outcome of infection for the host. In this article, we review findings related to influenza virus replication in macrophages and the impact of productive replication on macrophage antiviral functions. A clear understanding of the interactions between influenza viruses and macrophages may lead to new antiviral therapies to relieve the burden of severe disease associated with influenza viruses.

Title: Influenza-associated thrombotic microangiopathies.
Abstract: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to phenotypically similar disorders, including hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This review explores the role of the influenza virus as trigger of HUS or TTP. We conducted a literature survey in PubMed and Google Scholar using HUS, TTP, TMA, and influenza as keywords, and extracted and analyzed reported epidemiological and clinical data. We identified 25 cases of influenza-associated TMA. Five additional cases were linked to influenza vaccination and analyzed separately. Influenza A was found in 83%, 10 out of 25 during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Two patients had bona fide TTP with ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Median age was 15 years (range 0.5-68 years), two thirds were male. Oligoanuria was documented in 81% and neurological involvement in 40% of patients. Serum C3 was reduced in 5 out of 14 patients (36%); Coombs test was negative in 7 out of 7 and elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were documented in 6 out of 8 patients. Pathogenic complement gene mutations were found in 7 out of 8 patients tested (C3, MCP, or MCP combined with CFB or clusterin). Twenty out of 24 patients recovered completely, but 3 died (12%). Ten of the surviving patients underwent plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy, 5 plasma infusions. Influenza-mediated HUS or TTP is rare. A sizable proportion of tested patients demonstrated mutations associated with alternative pathway of complement dysregulation that was uncovered by this infection. Further research is warranted targeting the roles of viral neuraminidase, enhanced virus-induced complement activation and/or ADAMTS13 antibodies, and rational treatment approaches.

Title: Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza Venus reporter virus reveals broad diversity of MHC class II-positive antigen-bearing cells following infection in vivo.
Abstract: Although it is well established that Influenza A virus infection is initiated in the respiratory tract, the sequence of events and the cell types that become infected or access viral antigens remains incompletely understood. In this report, we used a novel Influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1) reporter virus that stably expresses the Venus fluorescent protein to identify antigen-bearing cells over time in a mouse model of infection using flow cytometry. These studies revealed that many hematopoietic cells, including subsets of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and eosinophils acquire influenza antigen in the lungs early post-infection. Surface staining of the viral HA revealed that most cell populations become infected, most prominently CD45<sup>neg</sup> cells, alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Finally, differences in infection status, cell lineage and MHC class II expression by antigen-bearing cells correlated with differences in their ability to re-stimulate influenza-specific CD4 T cells ex vivo. Collectively, these studies have revealed the cellular heterogeneity and complexity of antigen-bearing cells within the lung and their potential as targets of antigen recognition by CD4 T cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses a reporter virus to study antigen-bearing cells but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Increase in Human Infections with Novel Asian Lineage Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Viruses During the Fifth Epidemic - China, October 1, 2016-August 7, 2017.
Abstract: Among all influenza viruses assessed using CDC's Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), the Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (Asian H7N9), first reported in China in March 2013,* is ranked as the influenza virus with the highest potential pandemic risk (1). During October 1, 2016-August 7, 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; CDC, Taiwan; the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection; and the Macao CDC reported 759 human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses, including 281 deaths, to the World Health Organization (WHO), making this the largest of the five epidemics of Asian H7N9 infections that have occurred since 2013 (Figure 1). This report summarizes new viral and epidemiologic features identified during the fifth epidemic of Asian H7N9 in China and summarizes ongoing measures to enhance pandemic preparedness. Infections in humans and poultry were reported from most areas of China, including provinces bordering other countries, indicating extensive, ongoing geographic spread. The risk to the general public is very low and most human infections were, and continue to be, associated with poultry exposure, especially at live bird markets in mainland China. Throughout the first four epidemics of Asian H7N9 infections, only low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were detected among human, poultry, and environmental specimens and samples. During the fifth epidemic, mutations were detected among some Asian H7N9 viruses, identifying the emergence of high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses as well as viruses with reduced susceptibility to influenza antiviral medications recommended for treatment. Furthermore, the fifth-epidemic viruses diverged genetically into two separate lineages (Pearl River Delta lineage and Yangtze River Delta lineage), with Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses emerging as antigenically different compared with those from earlier epidemics. Because of its pandemic potential, candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) were produced in 2013 that have been used to make vaccines against Asian H7N9 viruses circulating at that time. CDC is working with partners to enhance surveillance for Asian H7N9 viruses in humans and poultry, to improve laboratory capability to detect and characterize H7N9 viruses, and to develop, test and distribute new CVV that could be used for vaccine production if a vaccine is needed.

Title: HVEM Imprints Memory Potential on Effector CD8 T Cells Required for Protective Mucosal Immunity.
Abstract: Mucosal immunity to reinfection with a highly virulent virus requires the accumulation and persistence of memory CD8 T cells at the site of primary infection. These cells may derive from memory precursor effector cells (MPECs), which are distinct from short-lived effector cells that provide acute protection but are often destined to die. Using respiratory virus infection, we show that herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM; TNFRSF14), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, provides key signals for MPEC persistence. HVEM-deficient CD8 T cells expanded normally but were skewed away from MPECs with resultant poor development of circulating and lung-resident memory cells. HVEM was selectively expressed on MPECs whereas MPECs deficient in HVEM failed to survive in adoptive transfer recipients. As a consequence, HVEM-deficient recipients failed to afford protection against respiratory reinfection with influenza virus. HVEM therefore represents a critical signal for MPECs and development of protective mucosal CD8 T cell memory.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of HVEM in CD8 T cell memory and mucosal immunity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Spread of Canine Influenza A(H3N2) Virus, United States.
Abstract: A canine influenza A(H3N2) virus emerged in the United States in February-March 2015, causing respiratory disease in dogs. The virus had previously been circulating among dogs in Asia, where it originated through the transfer of an avian-origin influenza virus around 2005 and continues to circulate. Sequence analysis suggests the US outbreak was initiated by a single introduction, in Chicago, of an H3N2 canine influenza virus circulating among dogs in South Korea in 2015. Despite local control measures, the virus has continued circulating among dogs in and around Chicago and has spread to several other areas of the country, particularly Georgia and North Carolina, although these secondary outbreaks appear to have ended within a few months. Some genetic variation has accumulated among the US viruses, with the appearance of regional-temporal lineages. The potential for interspecies transmission and zoonotic events involving this newly emerged influenza A virus is currently unknown.

Title: Population Diversity and Collective Interactions during Influenza Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to pose an enormous and unpredictable global public health threat, largely due to the continual evolution of escape from preexisting immunity and the potential for zoonotic emergence. Understanding how the unique genetic makeup and structure of IAV populations influences their transmission and evolution is essential for developing more-effective vaccines, therapeutics, and surveillance capabilities. Owing to their mutation-prone replicase and unique genome organization, IAV populations exhibit enormous amounts of diversity both in terms of sequence and functional gene content. Here, I review what is currently known about the genetic and genomic diversity present within IAV populations and how this diversity may shape the replicative and evolutionary dynamics of these viruses.

Title: Rare, high-affinity anti-pathogen antibodies from human repertoires, discovered using microfluidics and molecular genomics.
Abstract: Affinity-matured, functional anti-pathogen antibodies are present at low frequencies in natural human repertoires. These antibodies are often excellent candidates for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. However, mining natural human antibody repertoires is a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate a new method that uses microfluidics, yeast display, and deep sequencing to identify 247 natively paired anti-pathogen single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which were initially as rare as 1 in 100,000 in the human repertoires. Influenza A vaccination increased the frequency of influenza A antigen-binding scFv within the peripheral B cell repertoire from <0.1% in non-vaccinated donors to 0.3-0.4% in vaccinated donors, whereas pneumococcus vaccination did not increase the frequency of antigen-binding scFv. However, the pneumococcus scFv binders from the vaccinated library had higher heavy and light chain Replacement/Silent mutation (R/S) ratios, a measure of affinity maturation, than the pneumococcus binders from the corresponding non-vaccinated library. Thus, pneumococcus vaccination may increase the frequency of affinity-matured antibodies in human repertoires. We synthesized 10 anti-influenza A and nine anti-pneumococcus full-length antibodies that were highly abundant among antigen-binding scFv. All 10 anti-influenza A antibodies bound the appropriate antigen at K<sub>D</sub><10 nM and neutralized virus in cellular assays. All nine anti-pneumococcus full-length antibodies bound at least one polysaccharide serotype, and 71% of the anti-pneumococcus antibodies that we tested were functional in cell killing assays. Our approach has future application in a variety of fields, including the development of therapeutic antibodies for emerging viral diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.

Title: Structure-based drug discovery for combating influenza virus by targeting the PA-PB1 interaction.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections are serious public health concerns throughout the world. The development of compounds with novel mechanisms of action is urgently required due to the emergence of viruses with resistance to the currently-approved anti-influenza viral drugs. We performed in silico screening using a structure-based drug discovery algorithm called Nagasaki University Docking Engine (NUDE), which is optimised for a GPU-based supercomputer (DEstination for Gpu Intensive MAchine; DEGIMA), by targeting influenza viral PA protein. The compounds selected by NUDE were tested for anti-influenza virus activity using a cell-based assay. The most potent compound, designated as PA-49, is a medium-sized quinolinone derivative bearing a tetrazole moiety, and it inhibited the replication of influenza virus A/WSN/33 at a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.47 μM. PA-49 has the ability to bind PA and its anti-influenza activity was promising against various influenza strains, including a clinical isolate of A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B viruses. The docking simulation suggested that PA-49 interrupts the PA-PB1 interface where important amino acids are mostly conserved in the virus strains tested, suggesting the strain independent utility. Because our NUDE/DEGIMA system is rapid and efficient, it may help effective drug discovery against the influenza virus and other emerging viruses.

Title: Phylogenetic characterisation of circulating, clinical influenza isolates from Bali, Indonesia: preliminary report from the BaliMEI project.
Abstract: Human influenza represents a major public health concern, especially in south-east Asia where the risk of emergence and spread of novel influenza viruses is particularly high. The BaliMEI study aims to conduct a five year active surveillance and characterisation of influenza viruses in Bali using an extensive network of participating healthcare facilities. Samples were collected during routine diagnostic treatment in healthcare facilities. In addition to standard clinical and molecular methods for influenza typing, next generation sequencing and subsequent de novo genome assembly were performed to investigate the phylogeny of the collected patient samples. The samples collected are characteristic of the seasonally circulating influenza viruses with indications of phylogenetic links to other samples characterised in neighbouring countries during the same time period. There were some strong phylogenetic links with sequences from samples collected in geographically proximal regions, with some of the samples from the same time-period resulting to small clusters at the tree-end points. However this work, which is the first of its kind completely performed within Indonesia, supports the view that the circulating seasonal influenza in Bali reflects the strains circulating in geographically neighbouring areas as would be expected to occur within a busy regional transit centre.

Title: Risk for Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus on Poultry Farms, the Netherlands, 2007-2013.
Abstract: Using annual serologic surveillance data from all poultry farms in the Netherlands during 2007-2013, we quantified the risk for the introduction of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in different types of poultry production farms and putative spatial-environmental risk factors: distance from poultry farms to clay soil, waterways, and wild waterfowl areas. Outdoor-layer, turkey (meat and breeder), and duck (meat and breeder) farms had a significantly higher risk for LPAIV introduction than did indoor-layer farms. Except for outdoor-layer, all poultry types (i.e., broilers, chicken breeders, ducks, and turkeys) are kept indoors. For all production types, LPAIV risk decreased significantly with increasing distance to medium-sized waterways and with increasing distance to areas with defined wild waterfowl, but only for outdoor-layer and turkey farms. Future research should focus not only on production types but also on distance to waterways and wild bird areas. In addition, settlement of new poultry farms in high-risk areas should be discouraged.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses risk factors for LPAIV introduction in poultry farms based on environmental and production factors, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Identification of Polo-like kinases as potential novel drug targets for influenza A virus.
Abstract: In recent years genome-wide RNAi screens have revealed hundreds of cellular factors required for influenza virus infections in human cells. The long-term goal is to establish some of them as drug targets for the development of the next generation of antivirals against influenza. We found that several members of the polo-like kinases (PLK), a family of serine/threonine kinases with well-known roles in cell cycle regulation, were identified as hits in four different RNAi screens and we therefore studied their potential as drug target for influenza. We show that knockdown of PLK1, PLK3, and PLK4, as well as inhibition of PLK kinase activity by four different compounds, leads to reduced influenza virus replication, and we map the requirement of PLK activity to early stages of the viral replication cycle. We also tested the impact of the PLK inhibitor BI2536 on influenza virus replication in a human lung tissue culture model and observed strong inhibition of virus replication with no measurable toxicity. This study establishes the PLKs as potential drug targets for influenza and contributes to a more detailed understanding of the intricate interactions between influenza viruses and their host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host cellular factors (polo-like kinases) as drug targets affecting influenza virus replication, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A CRISPR Activation Screen Identifies a Pan-avian Influenza Virus Inhibitory Host Factor.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a pathogen that poses significant risks to human health. It is therefore critical to develop strategies to prevent influenza disease. Many loss-of-function screens have been performed to identify the host proteins required for viral infection. However, there has been no systematic screen to identify the host factors that, when overexpressed, are sufficient to prevent infection. In this study, we used CRISPR/dCas9 activation technology to perform a genome-wide overexpression screen to identify IAV restriction factors. The major hit from our screen, B4GALNT2, showed inhibitory activity against influenza viruses with an α2,3-linked sialic acid receptor preference. B4GALNT2 overexpression prevented the infection of every avian influenza virus strain tested, including the H5, H9, and H7 subtypes, which have previously caused disease in humans. Thus, we have used CRISPR/dCas9 activation technology to identify a factor that can abolish infection by avian influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies a host factor inhibiting avian influenza virus infection using CRISPR activation, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Phase 2 Randomized Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of MHAA4549A, a Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody, in a Human Influenza A Virus Challenge Model.
Abstract: MHAA4549A, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the hemagglutinin stalk region of influenza A virus (IAV), is being developed as a therapeutic for patients hospitalized with severe IAV infection. The safety and efficacy of MHAA4549A were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in a human IAV challenge model. One hundred healthy volunteers were inoculated with A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) IAV and, 24 to 36 h later, administered a single intravenous dose of either placebo, MHAA4549A (400, 1,200, or 3,600 mg), or a standard oral dose of oseltamivir. Subjects were assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity. The intent-to-treat-infected (ITTI) population was assessed for changes in viral load, influenza symptoms, and inflammatory biomarkers. MHAA4549A was well tolerated in all IAV challenge subjects. The 3,600-mg dose of MHAA4549A significantly reduced the viral burden relative to that of the placebo as determined by the area under the curve (AUC) of nasopharyngeal virus infection, quantified using quantitative PCR (98%) and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) (100%) assays. Peak viral load, duration of viral shedding, influenza symptom scores, mucus weight, and inflammatory biomarkers were also reduced. Serum PK was linear with a half-life of ∼23 days. No MHAA4549A-treated subjects developed anti-drug antibodies. In conclusion, MHAA4549A was well tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant and substantial antiviral activity in an IAV challenge model. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT01980966.).

Title: Influenza Virus Infection, Interferon Response, Viral Counter-Response, and Apoptosis.
Abstract: Human influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause global pandemics and epidemics, which remain serious threats to public health because of the shortage of effective means of control. To combat the surge of viral outbreaks, new treatments are urgently needed. Developing new virus control modalities requires better understanding of virus-host interactions. Here, we describe how IAV infection triggers cellular apoptosis and how this process can be exploited towards the development of new therapeutics, which might be more effective than the currently available anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Predominance of influenza A(H3N2) virus genetic subclade 3C.2a1 during an early 2016/17 influenza season in Europe - Contribution of surveillance data from World Health Organization (WHO) European Region to the WHO vaccine composition consultation for northern hemisphere 2017/18.
Abstract: During the European 2016/17 influenza season, A(H3N2) viruses have predominated and the majority clustered in genetic subclade 3C.2a1. Genetic analyses showed that circulating viruses have undergone considerable genetic diversification of the haemagglutinin gene from the current vaccine virus A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (clade 3C.2a), but the antigenic data that is limited by the challenges with the antigenic characterisation of currently circulating A(H3N2) viruses, showed no clear evidence of antigenic change. The recommended A(H3N2) vaccine component for the northern hemisphere 2017/18 influenza season remained unchanged. However, early and mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates were suggestive of reduced VE against A(H3N2) viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Discovery of dapivirine, a nonnucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, as a broad-spectrum antiviral against both influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: The emergence of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses poses a persistent threat to public health. The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for influenza virus infection have limited efficacy due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of influenza viruses. As part of our ongoing effort to develop the next generation of influenza antivirals with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to drug resistance, in this study we report the discovery of dapivirine, an FDA-approved HIV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, as a broad-spectrum antiviral against multiple strains of influenza A and B viruses with low micromolar efficacy. Mechanistic studies revealed that dapivirine inhibits the nuclear entry of viral ribonucleoproteins at the early stage of viral replication. As a result, viral RNA and protein synthesis were inhibited. Furthermore, dapivirine has a high in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance, and its antiviral activity is synergistic with oseltamivir carboxylate. In summary, the in vitro antiviral results of dapivirine suggest it is a promising candidate for the development of the next generation of dual influenza and HIV antivirals.

Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral activity of dapivirine against influenza viruses and its mechanism, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Biological Evaluation of Uridine Derivatives of 2-Deoxy Sugars as Potential Antiviral Compounds against Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to the limited ability of currently available treatments, there is an urgent need for new anti-influenza drugs with broad spectrum protection. We have previously shown that two 2-deoxy sugar derivatives of uridine (designated IW3 and IW7) targeting the glycan processing steps during maturation of viral glycoproteins show good anti-influenza virus activity and may be a promising alternative approach for the development of new anti-influenza therapy. In this study, a number of IW3 and IW7 analogues with different structural modifications in 2-deoxy sugar or uridine parts were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit influenza A virus infection in vitro. Using the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay and viral plaque reduction assay in vitro, we showed that compounds <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> exerted the most inhibitory effect on influenza virus A/ostrich/Denmark/725/96 (H5N2) infection in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (<i>IC</i><sub>50</sub>) for virus growth ranging from 82 to 100 (μM) without significant toxicity for the cells. The most active compound (<b>2</b>) showed activity of 82 μM with a selectivity index value of 5.27 against type A (H5N2) virus. Additionally, compound <b>2</b> reduced the formation of HA glycoprotein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, an analysis of physicochemical properties of studied compounds demonstrated a significant linear correlation between lipophilicity and antiviral activity. Therefore, inhibition of influenza A virus infection by conjugates of uridine and 2-deoxy sugars is a new promising approach for the development of new derivatives with anti-influenza activities.

Title: Zinc Finger-Containing Cellular Transcription Corepressor ZBTB25 Promotes Influenza Virus RNA Transcription and Is a Target for Zinc Ejector Drugs.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis. Our findings indicate that IAV usurps ZBTB25 for IAV RNA synthesis and serves as a novel and potential therapeutic antiviral target.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> IAV-induced seasonal influenza causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations. However, IAV has developed resistance to current antiviral drugs due to its high mutation rate. Therefore, development of drugs targeting cellular factors required for IAV replication is an attractive alternative for IAV therapy. Here, we discovered a cellular protein, ZBTB25, that enhances viral RdRp activity by binding to both viral RdRp and viral RNA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. A unique feature of ZBTB25 in the regulation of viral replication is its dual transcription functions, namely, promoting viral RNA transcription through binding to the U-rich region of vRNA and suppressing cellular interferon production. ZBTB25 contains a zinc finger domain that is required for RNA-inhibitory activity by chelating zinc ions. Disulfiram treatment disrupts the zinc finger functions, effectively repressing IAV replication. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that ZBTB25 regulates IAV RNA transcription and replication and serves as a promising antiviral target for IAV treatment.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a host cellular factor (ZBTB25) affecting viral RNA transcription, not on viral genotypes and their phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus recruits host protein kinase C to control assembly and activity of its replication machinery.
Abstract: Influenza virus expresses transcripts early in infection and transitions towards genome replication at later time points. This process requires de novo assembly of the viral replication machinery, large ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) composed of the viral polymerase, genomic RNA and oligomeric nucleoprotein (NP). Despite the central role of RNPs during infection, the factors dictating where and when they assemble are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that human protein kinase C (PKC) family members regulate RNP assembly. Activated PKCδ interacts with the polymerase subunit PB2 and phospho-regulates NP oligomerization and RNP assembly during infection. Consistent with its role in regulating RNP assembly, knockout of PKCδ impairs virus infection by selectively disrupting genome replication. However, primary transcription from pre-formed RNPs deposited by infecting particles is unaffected. Thus, influenza virus exploits host PKCs to regulate RNP assembly, a step required for the transition from primary transcription to genome replication during the infectious cycle.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host protein kinase C's role in viral replication machinery assembly, not on viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Cholesterol is required for stability and infectivity of influenza A and respiratory syncytial viruses.
Abstract: Cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane are considered to play a major role in the enveloped virus lifecycle. However, the functional role of cholesterol in assembly, infectivity and stability of respiratory RNA viruses is not fully understood. We previously reported that depletion of cellular cholesterol by cholesterol-reducing agents decreased production of human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) particles by inhibiting virus assembly. In this study, we analyzed the role of cholesterol on influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) production. Unlike hPIV1, treatment of human airway cells with the agents did not decrease virus particle production. However, the released virions were less homogeneous in density and unstable. Addition of exogenous cholesterol to the released virions restored virus stability and infectivity. Collectively, these data indicate a critical role of cholesterol in maintaining IAV and RSV membrane structure that is essential for sustaining viral stability and infectivity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of cholesterol in viral stability and infectivity but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza H9N2 virus isolated from air samples in LPMs in Jiangxi, China.
Abstract: Recently, avian influenza virus has caused repeated worldwide outbreaks in humans. Live Poultry Markets (LPMs) play an important role in the circulation and reassortment of novel Avian Influenza Virus (AIVs). Aerosol transmission is one of the most important pathways for influenza virus to spread among poultry, from poultry to mammals, and among mammals. In this study, air samples were collected from LPMs in Nanchang city between April 2014 and March 2015 to investigate possible aerosol transmission of AIVs. Air samples were detected for Flu A by Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RRT-PCR). If samples were positive for Flu A, they were inoculated into 9- to 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs. If the result was positive, the whole genome of the virus was sequenced by MiSeq. Phylogenetic trees of all 8 segments were constructed using MEGA 6.05 software. To investigate the possible aerosol transmission of AIVs, 807 air samples were collected from LPMs in Nanchang city between April 2014 and March 2015. Based on RRT-PCR results, 275 samples (34.1%) were Flu A positive, and one virus was successfully isolated with embryonated eggs. The virus shared high nucleotide homology with H9N2 AIVs from South China. Our study provides further evidence that the air in LPMs can be contaminated by influenza viruses and their nucleic acids, and this should be considered when choosing and evaluating disinfection strategies in LPMs, such as regular air disinfection. Aerosolized viruses such as the H9N2 virus detected in this study can increase the risk of human infection when people are exposed in LPMs.

Title: Schlafen 14 (SLFN14) is a novel antiviral factor involved in the control of viral replication.
Abstract: Schlafen (SLFN) proteins have been suggested to play important functions in cell proliferation and immune cell development. In this study, we determined the antiviral activities of putative RNA-helicase domain-containing SLFN14. Murine SLFN14 expression was specifically induced by TLR3-mediated pathways and type I interferon (IFN) in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. To examine the role of SLFN during viral infection, cells were infected with either wild-type PR8 or delNS1/PR8 virus. SLFN14 expression was specifically induced following influenza virus infection. Overexpression of SLFN14 in A549 cells reduced viral replication, whereas knockdown of SLFN14 in RAW264.7 cells enhanced viral titers. Furthermore, SLFN14 promoted the delay in viral NP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and enhanced RIG-I-mediated IFN-β signaling. In addition, SLFN14 overexpression promoted antiviral activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV), a DNA virus. In conclusion, our data suggest that SLFN14 is a novel antiviral factor for both DNA and RNA viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a host antiviral factor (SLFN14) affecting viral replication, not on viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Intracellular Colocalization of Influenza Viral RNA and Rab11A Is Dependent upon Microtubule Filaments.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) consists of eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments that are replicated in the host cell nucleus and transported to the plasma membrane for packaging into progeny virions. We have previously proposed a model where subcomplexes of vRNA are exported from the nucleus and assembled en route to the plasma membrane. However, the role of host cytoskeletal proteins in the cytoplasmic assembly of IAV vRNA segments remains unknown. Previous studies have suggested that IAV vRNA segments are transported via Rab11A-containing recycling endosomes (RE) and use both microtubules (MT) and actin. Rab11A RE transport primarily along MT; therefore, investigation of the role of MT in vRNA assembly is warranted. We explored the role of MT in vRNA assembly and replication by using multiple IAV strains in various cell types, including primary human airway epithelial cells. We observed that Rab11A localization was altered in the presence of MT-depolymerizing drugs, but growth of IAV in all of the cell types tested was unchanged. Fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization was performed to determine the role of MT in the assembly of multiple vRNA segments. Unexpectedly, we found that vRNA-vRNA association in cytoplasmic foci was independent of MT. Given the disparity of localization between Rab11A and vRNA segments in the absence of intact MT filaments, we analyzed the three-dimensional spatial relationship between Rab11A and vRNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells. We found that Rab11A and vRNA colocalization is dependent upon dynamic MT filaments. Taken together, our data suggest that cytoplasmic transport of influenza vRNA may include a Rab11A RE-independent mechanism.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> IAV infections cause a large public health burden through seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Pandemic IAVs emerge through reassortment of vRNA in animal or human hosts. Elucidation of the mechanism of intracellular dynamics of IAV assembly is necessary to understand reassortment. Our results describing the role of MT in vRNA transport and assembly expand upon previous studies characterizing vRNA assembly. This study is the first to assess the role of MT in influenza virus replication in human bronchial airway epithelial cells. In addition, we present novel data on the role of MT in facilitating the association between distinct vRNA segments. Interestingly, our results suggest that progressive assembly of vRNA segments may be cell type dependent and that vRNA may be transported through the cytoplasm without Rab11A RE in the absence of intact MT. These results enhance our understanding of vRNA assembly and the role of cytoskeletal proteins in that process.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates intracellular transport mechanisms of viral RNA and host cytoskeletal interactions, not viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Identification of Novel and Efficacious Chemical Compounds that Disturb Influenza A Virus Entry <i>in vitro</i>.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a negative RNA stranded virus of the family <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i>, and represents a major public health threat, compounding existing disease conditions. Influenza A virus replicates rapidly within its host and the segmented nature of its genome facilitates re-assortment, whereby whole genes are exchanged between influenza virus subtypes during replication. Antiviral medications are important pharmacological tools in influenza virus prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of currently available antiviral is impeded by sometimes high levels of resistance in circulating virus strains. Here, we identified novel anti-influenza compounds through screening of chemical compounds synthesized <i>de novo</i> on human lung epithelial cells. Computational and experimental screening of extensive and water soluble compounds identified novel influenza virus inhibitors that can reduce influenza virus infection without detectable toxic effects on host cells. Interestingly, the indicated active compounds inhibit viral replication most likely via interaction with cell receptors and disturb influenza virus entry into host cells. Collectively, screening of new synthesis chemical compounds on influenza A virus replication provides a novel and efficacious anti-influenza compounds that can inhibit viral replication via disturbing virus entry and indicates that these compounds are attractive candidates for evaluation as potential anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Impact of Vaccination on Distribution of T Cell Subsets in Antiretroviral-Treated HIV-Infected Children.
Abstract: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is generally prescribed to patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with vaccination introduced to prevent disease complications. However, little is known about the influence of immunization on T cell subsets' distribution during the course of infection. This study aims to identify the impact of viral replication and immunization on naïve, effector, effector memory, and central memory T cell subpopulations in ART-treated HIV-infected children. Fifty patients were recruited and injected intramuscularly with influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine on the day of enrollment (day 0) and day 28. Blood samples were collected for pre- and postvaccination on days 0 and 56 for analyzing T cell phenotypes by flow cytometry. Phenotypes of all T cell subsets remained the same after vaccination, except for a reduction in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, T cell subsets from patients with controllable viral load showed similar patterns to those with virological failure. Absolute CD4 count was also found to have a positive relationship with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In conclusion, vaccination and viral replication have a little effect on the distribution of T cell subpopulations. The CD4 count can be used for prediction of naïve T cell level in HIV-infected patients responding to ART.

Title: Influenza A virus cap-snatches host RNAs based on their abundance early after infection.
Abstract: The influenza A virus RNA polymerase cleaves the 5' ends of host RNAs and uses these RNA fragments as primers for viral mRNA synthesis. We performed deep sequencing of the 5' host-derived ends of the eight viral mRNAs of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus in infected A549 cells, and compared the population to those of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) and A/WSN/1933 (H1N1). In the three strains, the viral RNAs target different populations of host RNAs. Host RNAs are cap-snatched based on their abundance, and we found that RNAs encoding proteins involved in metabolism are overrepresented in the cap-snatched populations. Because this overrepresentation could be a reflection of the host response early after infection, and thus of the increased availability of these transcripts, our results suggest that host RNAs are cap-snatched mainly based on their abundance without preferential targeting.

Title: Going against the Tide: Selective Cellular Protein Synthesis during Virally Induced Host Shutoff.
Abstract: Many viral infections cause host shutoff, a state in which host protein synthesis is globally inhibited. Emerging evidence from vaccinia and influenza A virus infections indicates that subsets of cellular proteins are resistant to host shutoff and continue to be synthesized. Remarkably, the proteins of oxidative phosphorylation, the cellular-energy-generating machinery, are selectively synthesized in both cases. Identifying mechanisms that drive selective protein synthesis should facilitate understanding both viral replication and fundamental cell biology.

Title: Survival of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus in Tissues Derived from Experimentally Infected Chickens.
Abstract: Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been a severe threat to the poultry industry since its emergence in 1996. The carcass or tissues derived from infected birds may present the risk of the virus spreading to humans, animals, and the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated the survival of the virus in feather, muscle, and liver tissues collected from six chickens (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1 virus. The tissues were stored at +4°C or +20°C, and viral isolation was performed at different times for 360 days. The maximum periods for viral survival were observed in samples stored at +4°C in all tissue types and were 240 days in feather tissues, 160 days in muscle, and 20 days in liver. The viral infectivity at +20°C was maintained for a maximum of 30 days in the feather tissues, 20 days in muscle, and 3 days in liver. The viral inactivation rates partly overlapped in the feather and muscle tissues at the two temperatures. The virus was inactivated rapidly in the liver. Our experimental results indicate that the tissue type and temperature can greatly influence the survival of HPAI H5N1 virus in the tissues of infected chickens.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype can cause massive losses of poultry, and people need to handle a large number of chicken carcasses contaminated with the virus at outbreak sites. This study evaluated how long the virus can keep its infectivity in the three types of tissues derived from chickens infected with the virus. Our experimental results indicate that the virus can survive in tissues for a specific period of time depending on the tissue type and temperature. Our results are valuable for better understanding of viral ecology in the environment and for reducing the risk of the virus spreading via bird tissues contaminated with the virus.

Title: Serological and virological surveillance of avian influenza virus in domestic ducks of the north-east region of Bangladesh.
Abstract: Wild waterfowl are considered as the natural reservoir for avian influenza (AI) viruses. Bangladesh has been experiencing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks since 2007, mostly in chickens and occasionally in ducks. Ducks play an important role in the persistence and genetic recombination of AI viruses. This paper presents the results of serological and virological monitoring of AI in domestic ducks in 2013 in the north-east region of Bangladesh. A total of 871 and 662 serum samples and 909 and 302 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from domestic ducks of Mymensingh and Sylhet division, respectively, were analysed. Antibodies to type A influenza virus were detected by blocking ELISA in 60.73 and 47.73% serum samples of Mymensingh and Sylhet division, respectively. On haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test 17.5% of ELISA positive serum samples were found to be seropositive to H5 avian influenza virus. Five cloacal swabs and one oropharyngeal swab were positive for M gene of type A influenza virus by real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), but all of them were negative for H5 influenza virus. Three of the six viruses were successfully characterized as H1N5, H2N5 and H7N5 subtype of AI virus, the other three remained uncharacterized. On sequencing and phylogenetic analysis the HA and NA genes were found to be of Eurasian avian lineage. The H7 virus had cleavage site motif of low pathogenic virus. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were detected from apparently healthy domestic ducks. A small proportion of domestic ducks were found seropositive to H5 AI virus.

Title: A novel twelve class fluctuation test reveals higher than expected mutation rates for influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Influenza virus' low replicative fidelity contributes to its capacity for rapid evolution. Clonal sequencing and fluctuation tests have suggested that the influenza virus mutation rate is 2.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup> - 3.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied (s/n/r). However, sequencing assays are biased toward mutations with minimal fitness impacts and fluctuation tests typically investigate only a subset of all possible single nucleotide mutations. We developed a fluctuation test based on reversion to fluorescence in a set of virally encoded mutant green fluorescent proteins, which allowed us to measure the rates of selectively neutral mutations representative of the twelve different mutation types. We measured an overall mutation rate of 1.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup> s/n/r for PR8 (H1N1) and 2.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> s/n/r for Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) and a transitional bias of 2.7-3.6.

Title: Visualization of early influenza A virus trafficking in human dendritic cells using STED microscopy.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) primarily target respiratory epithelial cells, but can also replicate in immune cells, including human dendritic cells (DCs). Super-resolution microscopy provides a novel method of visualizing viral trafficking by overcoming the resolution limit imposed by conventional light microscopy, without the laborious sample preparation of electron microscopy. Using three-color Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, we visualized input IAV nucleoprotein (NP), early and late endosomal compartments (EEA1 and LAMP1 respectively), and HLA-DR (DC membrane/cytosol) by immunofluorescence in human DCs. Surface bound IAV were internalized within 5 min of infection. The association of virus particles with early endosomes peaked at 5 min when 50% of NP+ signals were also EEA1+. Peak association with late endosomes occurred at 15 min when 60% of NP+ signals were LAMP1+. At 30 min of infection, the majority of NP signals were in the nucleus. Our findings illustrate that early IAV trafficking in human DCs proceeds via the classical endocytic pathway.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study visualizes early influenza A virus trafficking in human dendritic cells using microscopy but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: AGO2 Negatively Regulates Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway by Competition Binding IRF3 with CBP/p300.
Abstract: Viral infection triggers a series of signaling cascades and host innate immune responses, including interferon (IFN) production, which depends on coordinated activity of multiple transcription factors. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 are core factors that participate in transcriptional complex formation in the nucleus. In general, cells balance the production of IFNs through suppressive and stimulative mechanisms, but viral infections can disrupt such equilibrium. This study determined that H5N1 viral infection reduced the distribution of human argonaute 2 (AGO2) in A549 cell nucleus. AGO2 did not block phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding ability of IRF3 but inhibited its association with CBP. Therefore, this newly revealed mechanism shows that cellular response leads to transfer of AGO2 from cell nucleus and promotes IFN-β expression to increase host survival during viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host cell protein AGO2's role in regulating interferon signaling during viral infection, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: <i>In Vivo</i> Imaging of Influenza Virus Infection in Immunized Mice.
Abstract: Immunization is the cornerstone of seasonal influenza control and represents an important component of pandemic preparedness strategies. Using a bioluminescent reporter virus, we demonstrate the application of noninvasive <i>in vivo</i> imaging system (IVIS) technology to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of candidate vaccines and immunotherapy in a mouse model of influenza. Sequential imaging revealed distinct spatiotemporal kinetics of bioluminescence in groups of mice passively or actively immunized by various strategies that accelerated the clearance of the challenge virus at different rates and by distinct mechanisms. Imaging findings were consistent with conclusions derived from virus titers in the lungs and, notably, were more informative than conventional efficacy endpoints in some cases. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of IVIS as a qualitative approach to support preclinical evaluation of candidate medical countermeasures for influenza in mice.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A viruses remain a persistent threat to public health. Vaccination and immunotherapy are effective countermeasures for the control of influenza but must contend with antigenic drift and the risk of resistance to antivirals. Traditional preclinical efficacy studies for novel vaccine and pharmaceutical candidates can be time-consuming and expensive and are inherently limited in scope. <i>In vivo</i> imaging approaches offer the potential to noninvasively track virus replication in real time in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of bioluminescent imaging for tracking influenza virus replication in the lungs of immunized mice and also identify important factors that may influence the accurate interpretation of imaging results. Our findings support the potential of IVIS approaches to enhance traditional preclinical efficacy evaluation of candidate vaccines and human monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of influenza.

Title: Ribonuclease from <i>Bacillus</i> Acts as an Antiviral Agent against Negative- and Positive-Sense Single Stranded Human Respiratory RNA Viruses.
Abstract: <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> ribonuclease (binase) was shown to be a promising antiviral agent in animal models and cell cultures. However, the mode of its antiviral action remains unknown. To assess the binase effect on intracellular viral RNA we have selected single stranded negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, influenza virus, and rhinovirus, respectively, which annually cause respiratory illnesses and are characterized by high contagious nature, mutation rate, and antigen variability. We have shown that binase exerts an antiviral effect on both viruses at the same concentration, which does not alter the spectrum of A549 cellular proteins and expression of housekeeping genes. The titers of influenza A (H1N1pdm) virus and human rhinovirus serotype 1A were reduced by 40% and 65%, respectively. A preincubation of influenza virus with binase before infection significantly reduced viral titer after single-cycle replication of the virus. Using influenza A virus mini genome system we showed that binase reduced GFP reporter signaling indicating a binase action on the expression of viral mRNA. Binase reduced the level of H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA accumulation in A549 cells by 20%. Since the viral mRNA is a possible target for binase this agent could be potentially applied in the antiviral therapy against both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses.

Title: Interferon-λ Mediates Non-redundant Front-Line Antiviral Protection against Influenza Virus Infection without Compromising Host Fitness.
Abstract: Lambda interferons (IFNλs) or type III IFNs share homology, expression patterns, signaling cascades, and antiviral functions with type I IFNs. This has complicated the unwinding of their unique non-redundant roles. Through the systematic study of influenza virus infection in mice, we herein show that IFNλs are the first IFNs produced that act at the epithelial barrier to suppress initial viral spread without activating inflammation. If infection progresses, type I IFNs come into play to enhance viral resistance and induce pro-inflammatory responses essential for confronting infection but causing immunopathology. Central to this are neutrophils which respond to both cytokines to upregulate antimicrobial functions but exhibit pro-inflammatory activation only to type I IFNs. Accordingly, Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice display enhanced type I IFN production, neutrophilia, lung injury, and lethality, while therapeutic administration of PEG-IFNλ potently suppresses these effects. IFNλs therefore constitute the front line of antiviral defense in the lung without compromising host fitness.

Title: An innate defense peptide BPIFA1/SPLUNC1 restricts influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The airway epithelium secretes proteins that function in innate defense against infection. Bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) is secreted into airways and has a protective role during bacterial infections, but it is not known whether it also has an antiviral role. To determine a role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) infection and to find the underlying defense mechanism, we developed transgenic mouse models that are deficient in BPIFA1 and used these, in combination with in vitro three-dimensional mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures, to investigate its antiviral properties. We show that BPIFA1 has a significant role in mucosal defense against IAV infection. BPIFA1 secretion was highly modulated after IAV infection. Mice deficient in BPIFA1 lost more weight after infection, supported a higher viral load and virus reached the peripheral lung earlier, indicative of a defect in the control of infection. Further analysis using mTEC cultures showed that BPIFA1-deficient cells bound more virus particles, displayed increased nuclear import of IAV ribonucleoprotein complexes, and supported higher levels of viral replication. Our results identify a critical role of BPIFA1 in the initial phase of infection by inhibiting the binding and entry of IAV into airway epithelial cells.

Title: Does influenza pandemic preparedness and mitigation require gain-of-function research?
Abstract: The risk and benefits of gain-of-function studies on influenza A have been widely debated since 2012 when the methods to create two respiratory transmissible H5N1 mutant isolates were published. Opponents of gain-of-function studies argue the biosecurity risk is unacceptable, while proponents cite potential uses for pandemic surveillance, preparedness and mitigation. In this commentary, we provide an overview of the background and applications of gain-of-function research and argue that the anticipated benefits have yet to materialize while the significant risks remain.

Title: Antiviral activity of formyl peptide receptor 2 antagonists against influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are one of the most important respiratory pathogens worldwide, causing both epidemic and pandemic infections. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of FPR2 antagonists PBP10 and BOC2 on influenza virus replication. We determined that these molecules exhibit antiviral effects against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H6N2) and B viruses. FPR2 antagonists used in combination with oseltamivir showed additive antiviral effects. Mechanistically, the antiviral effect of PBP10 and BOC2 is mediated through early inhibition of virus-induced ERK activation. Finally, our preclinical studies showed that FPR2 antagonists protected mice from lethal infections induced by influenza, both in a prophylactic and therapeutic manner. Thus, FPR2 antagonists might be explored for novel treatments against influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral effects of host-targeted FPR2 antagonists without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Host dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-directed cycloguanil analogues endowed with activity against influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus.
Abstract: We have identified a series of 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines, structurally related to the antimalarial drug cycloguanil, as new inhibitors of influenza A and B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) via targeting of the host dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. Most analogues proved active against influenza B virus in the low micromolar range, and the best compounds (11, 13, 14 and 16) even reached the sub-micromolar potency of zanamivir (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.060 μM), and markedly exceeded (up to 327 times) the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin. Activity was also observed for two influenza A strains, including a virus with the S31N mutant form of M2 proton channel, which is the most prevalent resistance mutation for amantadine. Importantly, the compounds displayed nanomolar activity against RSV and a superior selectivity index, since the ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration was >10,000 for the three most active compounds 11, 14 and 16 (EC<sub>50</sub> ∼0.008 μM), far surpassing the potency and safety profile of the licensed drug ribavirin (EC<sub>50</sub> = 5.8 μM, SI > 43).

Title: Endophilin B2 facilitates endosome maturation in response to growth factor stimulation, autophagy induction, and influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Endocytosis, and the subsequent trafficking of endosomes, requires dynamic physical alterations in membrane shape that are mediated in part by endophilin proteins. The endophilin B family of proteins contains an N-terminal Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (N-BAR) domain that induces membrane curvature to regulate intracellular membrane dynamics. Whereas endophilin B1 (SH3GLB1/Bif-1) is known to be involved in a number of cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and endocytosis, the cellular function of endophilin B2 (SH3GLB2) is not well understood. In this study, we used genetic approaches that revealed that endophilin B2 is not required for embryonic development <i>in vivo</i> but that endophilin B2 deficiency impairs endosomal trafficking <i>in vitro</i>, as evidenced by suppressed endosome acidification, EGFR degradation, autophagic flux, and influenza A viral RNA nuclear entry and replication. Mechanistically, although the loss of endophilin B2 did not affect endocytic internalization and lysosomal function, endophilin B2 appeared to regulate the trafficking of endocytic vesicles and autophagosomes to late endosomes or lysosomes. Moreover, we also found that despite having an intracellular localization and tissue distribution similar to endophilin B1, endophilin B2 is dispensable for mitochondrial apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that endophilin B2 positively regulates the endocytic pathway in response to growth factor signaling, autophagy induction, and viral entry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of endophilin B2 in endosome maturation and influenza A virus infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Transcriptomic profiling of a chicken lung epithelial cell line (CLEC213) reveals a mitochondrial respiratory chain activity boost during influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Avian Influenza virus (AIV) is a major concern for the global poultry industry. Since 2012, several countries have reported AIV outbreaks among domestic poultry. These outbreaks had tremendous impact on poultry production and socio-economic repercussion on farmers. In addition, the constant emergence of highly pathogenic AIV also poses a significant risk to human health. In this study, we used a chicken lung epithelial cell line (CLEC213) to gain a better understanding of the molecular consequences of low pathogenic AIV infection in their natural host. Using a transcriptome profiling approach based on microarrays, we identified a cluster of mitochondrial genes highly induced during the infection. Interestingly, most of the regulated genes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. The biological consequences of this transcriptomic induction result in a 2.5- to 4-fold increase of the ATP concentration within the infected cells. PB1-F2, a viral protein that targets the mitochondria was not found associated to the boost of activity of the respiratory chain. We next explored the possibility that ATP may act as a host-derived danger signal (through production of extracellular ATP) or as a boost to increase AIV replication. We observed that, despite the activation of the P2X7 purinergic receptor pathway, a 1mM ATP addition in the cell culture medium had no effect on the virus replication in our epithelial cell model. Finally, we found that oligomycin, a drug that inhibits the oxidative phosphorylation process, drastically reduced the AIV replication in CLEC213 cells, without apparent cellular toxicity. Collectively, our results suggest that AIV is able to boost the metabolic capacities of its avian host in order to provide the important energy needs required to produce progeny virus.

Title: A coevolution analysis for identifying protein-protein interactions by Fourier transform.
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play key roles in life processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulations, and immune response, etc. Identification of PPIs enables better understanding of the functional networks within a cell. Common experimental methods for identifying PPIs are time consuming and expensive. However, recent developments in computational approaches for inferring PPIs from protein sequences based on coevolution theory avoid these problems. In the coevolution theory model, interacted proteins may show coevolutionary mutations and have similar phylogenetic trees. The existing coevolution methods depend on multiple sequence alignments (MSA); however, the MSA-based coevolution methods often produce high false positive interactions. In this paper, we present a computational method using an alignment-free approach to accurately detect PPIs and reduce false positives. In the method, protein sequences are numerically represented by biochemical properties of amino acids, which reflect the structural and functional differences of proteins. Fourier transform is applied to the numerical representation of protein sequences to capture the dissimilarities of protein sequences in biophysical context. The method is assessed for predicting PPIs in Ebola virus. The results indicate strong coevolution between the protein pairs (NP-VP24, NP-VP30, NP-VP40, VP24-VP30, VP24-VP40, and VP30-VP40). The method is also validated for PPIs in influenza and E.coli genomes. Since our method can reduce false positive and increase the specificity of PPI prediction, it offers an effective tool to understand mechanisms of disease pathogens and find potential targets for drug design. The Python programs in this study are available to public at URL (https://github.com/cyinbox/PPI).

Title: The innate immunity of guinea pigs against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection.
Abstract: H5N1 avian influenza viruses are a major pandemic concern. In contrast to the highly virulent phenotype of H5N1 in humans and many animal models, guinea pigs do not typically display signs of severe disease in response to H5N1 virus infection. Here, proteomic and transcriptional profiling were applied to identify host factors that account for the observed attenuation of A/Tiger/Harbin/01/2002 (H5N1) virulence in guinea pigs. RIG-I and numerous interferon stimulated genes were among host proteins with altered expression in guinea pig lungs during H5N1 infection. Overexpression of RIG-I or the RIG-I adaptor protein MAVS in guinea pig cell lines inhibited H5N1 replication. Endogenous GBP-1 expression was required for RIG-I mediated inhibition of viral replication upstream of the activity of MAVS. Furthermore, we show that guinea pig complement is involved in viral clearance, the regulation of inflammation, and cellular apoptosis during influenza virus infection of guinea pigs. This work uncovers features of the guinea pig innate immune response to influenza that may render guinea pigs resistant to highly pathogenic influenza viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Intravenous Immunoglobulin Protects Against Severe Pandemic Influenza Infection.
Abstract: Influenza is a highly contagious, acute, febrile respiratory infection that can have fatal consequences particularly in individuals with chronic illnesses. Sporadic reports suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be efficacious in the influenza setting. We investigated the potential of human IVIg to ameliorate influenza infection in ferrets exposed to either the pandemic H1N1/09 virus (pH1N1) or highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). IVIg administered at the time of influenza virus exposure led to a significant reduction in lung viral load following pH1N1 challenge. In the lethal H5N1 model, the majority of animals given IVIg survived challenge in a dose dependent manner. Protection was also afforded by purified F(ab')<sub>2</sub> but not Fc fragments derived from IVIg, supporting a specific antibody-mediated mechanism of protection. We conclude that pre-pandemic IVIg can modulate serious influenza infection-associated mortality and morbidity. IVIg could be useful prophylactically in the event of a pandemic to protect vulnerable population groups and in the critical care setting as a first stage intervention.

Title: MicroRNA-125a and -b inhibit A20 and MAVS to promote inflammation and impair antiviral response in COPD.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections lead to severe inflammation in the airways. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characteristically have exaggerated airway inflammation and are more susceptible to infections with severe symptoms and increased mortality. The mechanisms that control inflammation during IAV infection and the mechanisms of immune dysregulation in COPD are unclear. We found that IAV infections lead to increased inflammatory and antiviral responses in primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) from healthy nonsmoking and smoking subjects. In pBECs from COPD patients, infections resulted in exaggerated inflammatory but deficient antiviral responses. A20 is an important negative regulator of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory but not antiviral responses, and A20 expression was reduced in COPD. IAV infection increased the expression of miR-125a or -b, which directly reduced the expression of A20 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), and caused exaggerated inflammation and impaired antiviral responses. These events were replicated in vivo in a mouse model of experimental COPD. Thus, miR-125a or -b and A20 may be targeted therapeutically to inhibit excessive inflammatory responses and enhance antiviral immunity in IAV infections and in COPD.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies host microRNA regulation of inflammation and antiviral response in COPD during influenza infection without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Double Plant Homeodomain Fingers 2 (DPF2) Promotes the Immune Escape of Influenza Virus by Suppressing Beta Interferon Production.
Abstract: The high mutation rates of the influenza virus genome facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs against influenza virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective. Therefore, we identified host cell determinants dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication, with the goal of preventing viral escape and finding effective antivirals. To identify these host factors, we screened 2,732 human genes using RNA interference and focused on one of the identified host factors, the double plant homeodomain fingers 2 (DPF2/REQ) gene, for this study. We found that knockdown of DPF2 in cells infected with influenza virus resulted in decreased expression of viral proteins and RNA. Furthermore, production of progeny virus was reduced by two logs in the multiple-cycle growth kinetics assay. We also found that DPF2 was involved in the replication of seasonal influenza A and B viruses. Because DPF2 plays a crucial role in the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which negatively regulates type I interferon (IFN) induction, we examined the relationship between DPF2 and IFN responses during viral infection. The results showed that knockdown of DPF2 resulted in increased expression of IFN-β and induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in infected cells. In addition, high levels of several cytokines/chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8], IP-10, and IL-6) and antiviral proteins (MxA and ISG56) were produced by DPF2 knockdown cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel host factor, DPF2, that is required for influenza virus to evade the host immune response and that may serve as a potential antiviral target.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics and is an ongoing threat to public health worldwide. Influenza virus relies heavily on cellular factors to complete its life cycle. Here we identified a novel host factor, DPF2, which is involved in influenza virus infection. Our results showed that DPF2 plays a crucial role in the replication and propagation of influenza virus. DPF2 functions in the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which negatively regulates type I IFN induction. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the IFN response and DPF2 in influenza virus infection. Upon influenza virus infection, DPF2 dysregulated IFN-β induction and expression of cytokines/chemokines and antiviral proteins. This study provides evidence that influenza virus utilizes DPF2 to escape host innate immunity.

Title: BMAL1 links the circadian clock to viral airway pathology and asthma phenotypes.
Abstract: Patients with asthma experience circadian variations in their symptoms. However it remains unclear how specific aspects of this common airway disease relate to clock genes, which are critical to the generation of circadian rhythms in mammals. Here, we used a viral model of acute and chronic airway disease to examine how circadian clock disruption affects asthmatic lung phenotypes. Deletion of the core clock gene bmal1 or environmental disruption of circadian function by jet lag exacerbated acute viral bronchiolitis caused by Sendai virus (SeV) and influenza A virus in mice. Post-natal deletion of bmal1 was sufficient to trigger increased SeV susceptibility and correlated with impaired control of viral replication. Importantly, bmal1<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed much more extensive asthma-like airway changes post infection, including mucus production and increased airway resistance. In human airway samples from two asthma cohorts, we observed altered expression patterns of multiple clock genes. Our results suggest a role for bmal1 in the development of asthmatic airway disease via the regulation of lung antiviral responses to common viral triggers of asthma.

Title: Avian and human influenza virus compatible sialic acid receptors in little brown bats.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to threaten animal and human health globally. Bats are asymptomatic reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses. Recent reports of two novel IAVs in fruit bats and serological evidence of avian influenza virus (AIV) H9 infection in frugivorous bats raise questions about the role of bats in IAV epidemiology. IAVs bind to sialic acid (SA) receptors on host cells, and it is widely believed that hosts expressing both SA α2,3-Gal and SA α2,6-Gal receptors could facilitate genetic reassortment of avian and human IAVs. We found abundant co-expression of both avian (SA α2,3-Gal) and human (SA α2,6-Gal) type SA receptors in little brown bats (LBBs) that were compatible with avian and human IAV binding. This first ever study of IAV receptors in a bat species suggest that LBBs, a widely-distributed bat species in North America, could potentially be co-infected with avian and human IAVs, facilitating the emergence of zoonotic strains.

Title: Use of AAScatterPlot tool for monitoring the evolution of the hemagglutinin cleavage site in H9 avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Viruses rapidly evolve due to their error-prone genome replication, and identifying which mutations are selected for during evolution is critical for virus surveillance efforts. Here we introduce a scatter plot tool (AAScatterPlot) that easily shows the selection and avoidance of certain protein mutations based on biochemical properties. We demonstrate its utility for monitoring the evolution of H9 avian influenza viruses from China between 2005 and 2015, particularly at the hemagglutinin (HA) proteolytic cleavage site (PCS) that can affect virus activation and pathogenicity. Given genome sequences, the AAScatterPlot tool compacts into a single plot, information about the hydropathy index, Van der Waals volume, chemical property and occurrence frequency of amino acid residues. The tool also shows the range of residues that could arise from a single point mutation in the genome, which can then be compared against the observed residues to identify mutation constraints. Through this approach, we found that the 2nd position towards the N-terminus side of the HA PCS (P2 position) avoided hydrophobic residues, whereas the P3 position avoided hydrophilic residues. AAScatterPlot is available at https://github.com/WhittakerLab/AAScatterPlot. gary.whittaker@cornell.edu. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Title: Molecular epidemiology of influenza A(H1N1)PDM09 hemagglutinin gene circulating in São Paulo State , Brazil: 2016 anticipated influenza season.
Abstract: Compared to previous years, seasonal influenza activity commenced early in São Paulo State, Brazil, Southern hemisphere during the 2016 year. In order to investigate the genetic pattern of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the State of Sao Paulo a total of 479 respiratory samples, collected in January by Sentinel Surveillance Units, were screened by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 6 Influenza viruses A(H1N1)pdm09 presenting ct values ≤ 30 were sequenced following phylogenetic analysis. The present study identified the circulation of the new 6B.1 subgroup (A/Sao Paulo/10-118/2016 and A/Sao Paulo/3032/2016). In addition, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 group 6B has also been identified during January in the State of Sao Paulo. Despite amino acid changes and changes in potential glycosylation motifs, 6B.1 viruses were well inhibited by the reference ferret antiserum against A/California/07/2009 virus, the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of the vaccine for the 2016 influenza season.

Title: In vivo inhibition of influenza A virus replication by RNA interference targeting the PB2 subunit via intratracheal delivery.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is a major threat to human health. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of viral infections. In this study, we constructed a series of DNA vector-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that target various genes of the influenza A virus using the polymerase III U6-RNA promoter to prevent influenza virus infection in vitro and in a mouse model. Three sets of DNA vector-based shRNA, two targeting genes encoding the polymerase acidic protein (PA) and one targeting polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), efficiently inhibited the replication of influenza virus A/WSN/33(H1N1) in vitro. We also successfully prevented influenza virus A/WSN/33(H1N1) infection in a C57BL/6 mouse model by intratracheal delivery of anti-PB2 shRNA. Our findings suggest that the PB2-targeting shRNA plasmid showed potential for use as an RNAi-based therapeutic for influenza virus infection.

Title: The MEK-inhibitor CI-1040 displays a broad anti-influenza virus activity in vitro and provides a prolonged treatment window compared to standard of care in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza viruses (IV) continue to pose an imminent threat to human welfare. Yearly re-occurring seasonal epidemic outbreaks and pandemics with high mortality can occur. Besides vaccination against a limited number of viral strains only a few antiviral drugs are available, which are losing their effectiveness as more and more IV strains become resistant. Thus, new antiviral approaches that omit IV resistance are urgently needed. Here, the dependency on the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway for IV replication opens a new perspective. In consequence, we studied the antiviral potential of the MEK inhibitor Cl-1040 (PD184352). We show that Cl-1040 significantly reduces virus titers in vitro via retention of viral RNP complexes in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, Cl-1040 is effective against a broad range of IV strains, including highly pathogenic avian IV, as well as against a Tamiflu<sup>®</sup>-resistant IV strain. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that Cl-1040 can reduce IV lung titers in vivo. Importantly, the treatment window for Cl-1040 expands up to 48 h post infection when Tamiflu<sup>®</sup> treatment has no effect.

Title: Inducible GBP5 Mediates the Antiviral Response via Interferon-Related Pathways during Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Guanylate binding protein (GBP) 5 belongs to the GBP family, which is involved in important cellular processes, including signal transduction, translation, vesicle trafficking, and exocytosis. Structurally, GBPs display a high degree of homology and share highly conserved GTP-binding or hydrolysis domains. GBP5 was reported to be a critical cellular factor in inflammasome assembly. However, little is known about its role in the host antiviral innate immune response. In this study, we found that GBP5 expression was significantly elevated in influenza patients and influenza A virus-infected A549 human lung epithelial cells. The overexpression of GBP5 inhibited virus replication by enhancing the expression of virus-induced interferon (IFN) and IFN-related effectors. Knockdown of GBP5 had the opposite effect. Moreover, GBP5 enhanced endogenous IFN expression by interacting with the NF-κB-essential modulator complex and stimulating NF-κB signaling. Additionally, the expression of proinflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, was also activated by GBP5. Taken together, our results reveal that GBP5 inhibited virus replication through the activation of IFN signaling and proinflammatory factors.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of a host protein (GBP5) in antiviral response but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Visualization of Alternative Functional Configurations of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Facilitates Rapid Selection of Complementing Vaccines in Emergency Situations.
Abstract: Successful immunization against avian influenza virus (AIV) requires eliciting an adequate polyclonal response to AIV hemagglutinin (HA) subunit 1 (HA1) epitopes. Outbreaks of highly-pathogenic (HP) AIV subtype H5N1 can occur in vaccinated flocks in many endemic areas. Protection against emerging AIV is partly hindered by the limitations of vaccine production and transport, the use of leaky vaccines, and the use of multiple, and often antigenically-diverse, vaccines. It was hypothesized that the majority of alternative functional configurations (AFC) within the AIV HA1 can be represented by the pool of vaccine seed viruses currently in production because only a finite number of AFC are possible within each substructure of the molecule. Therefore, combinations of commercial vaccines containing complementing structural units (CSU) to each HA1 substructure can elicit responses to the totality of a given emerging AIV HA1 substructure isoforms. Analysis of homology-based 3D models of vaccine seed and emerging viruses facilitated the definition of HA1 AFC isoforms. CSU-based plots were used to predict which commercial vaccine combinations could have been used to cover nine selected AFC isoforms on recent Egyptian HP AIV H5N1 outbreak viruses. It is projected that expansion of the vaccine HA1 3D model database will improve international emergency responses to AIV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper models structural configurations of hemagglutinin for vaccine selection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak detected in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of influenza-like illness in Pune, India, 2012-2015.
Abstract: An outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected during the ongoing community-based surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). Among reported 119 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases (59 cases in the year 2012 and 60 cases in 2015) in summer months, common clinical features were fever (100%), cough (90·7%), sore throat (85·7%), nasal discharge (48·7%), headache (55·5%), fatigue (18·5%), breathlessness (3·4%), and ear discharge (1·7%). Rise in ILI cases were negatively correlated with the seasonal factors such as relative humidity (Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient, i.e. r = -0·71 in the year 2012 and r = -0·44 in the year 2015), while rise in ILI cases were positively correlated with the temperature difference (r = 0·44 in the year 2012 and r = 0·77 in the year 2015). The effective reproduction number R, was estimated to be 1·30 in 2012 and 1·64 in 2015. The study highlights the rise in unusual influenza activity in summer month with high attack rate of ILI among children aged ⩽9 years. Children in this age group may need special attention for influenza vaccination. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was confirmed in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of ILI in Pune, India, 2012-2015.

Title: Phosphatidylserine Lateral Organization Influences the Interaction of Influenza Virus Matrix Protein 1 with Lipid Membranes.
Abstract: Influenza A virus matrix protein 1 (M1) is an essential component involved in the structural stability of the virus and in the budding of new virions from infected cells. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis of virion formation and the budding process is required in order to devise new therapeutic approaches. We performed a detailed investigation of the interaction between M1 and phosphatidylserine (PS) (i.e., its main binding target at the plasma membrane [PM]), as well as the distribution of PS itself, both in model membranes and in living cells. To this end, we used a combination of techniques, including Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), confocal microscopy imaging, raster image correlation spectroscopy, and number and brightness (N&B) analysis. Our results show that PS can cluster in segregated regions in the plane of the lipid bilayer, both in model bilayers constituted of PS and phosphatidylcholine and in living cells. The viral protein M1 interacts specifically with PS-enriched domains, and such interaction in turn affects its oligomerization process. Furthermore, M1 can stabilize PS domains, as observed in model membranes. For living cells, the presence of PS clusters is suggested by N&B experiments monitoring the clustering of the PS sensor lactadherin. Also, colocalization between M1 and a fluorescent PS probe suggest that, in infected cells, the matrix protein can specifically bind to the regions of PM in which PS is clustered. Taken together, our observations provide novel evidence regarding the role of PS-rich domains in tuning M1-lipid and M1-M1 interactions at the PM of infected cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza virus particles assemble at the plasma membranes (PM) of infected cells. This process is orchestrated by the matrix protein M1, which interacts with membrane lipids while binding to the other proteins and genetic material of the virus. Despite its importance, the initial step in virus assembly (i.e., M1-lipid interaction) is still not well understood. In this work, we show that phosphatidylserine can form lipid domains in physical models of the inner leaflet of the PM. Furthermore, the spatial organization of PS in the plane of the bilayer modulates M1-M1 interactions. Finally, we show that PS domains appear to be present in the PM of living cells and that M1 seems to display a high affinity for them.

Title: Influenza A virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase act as novel motile machinery.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) membrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are determinants of virus infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, host specificity, and major antigenicity. HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells. We concluded that cooperation of HA and NA moves IAV particles on a cell surface and enhances virus infection of host cells.

Title: Virological Surveillance of Influenza A Subtypes Isolated in 2014 from Clinical Outbreaks in Canadian Swine.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are respiratory pathogens associated with an acute respiratory disease that occurs year-round in swine production. It is currently one of the most important pathogens in swine populations, with the potential to infect other host species including humans. Ongoing research indicates that the three major subtypes of IAV-H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2-continue to expand in their genetic and antigenic diversity. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of 16 IAVs isolated from different clinical outbreaks in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan in 2014. We also examined the genetic basis for probable antigenic differences among sequenced viruses. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, all 13 Canadian H3N2 viruses belonged to cluster IV, eight H3N2 viruses were part of the IV-C cluster, and one virus belonged to the IV-B and one to the IV-D cluster. Based on standards used in this study, three H3N2 viruses could not be clearly classified into any currently established group within cluster IV (A to F). Three H1N2 viruses were part of the H1α cluster.

Reason: The study reports genetic and phylogenetic analysis of influenza A subtypes without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Multiple Sources of Genetic Diversity of Influenza A Viruses during the Hajj.
Abstract: Outbreaks of respiratory virus infection at mass gatherings pose significant health risks to attendees, host communities, and ultimately the global population if they help facilitate viral emergence. However, little is known about the genetic diversity, evolution, and patterns of viral transmission during mass gatherings, particularly how much diversity is generated by <i>in situ</i> transmission compared to that imported from other locations. Here, we describe the genome-scale evolution of influenza A viruses sampled from the Hajj pilgrimages at Makkah during 2013 to 2015. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the diversity of influenza viruses at the Hajj pilgrimages was shaped by multiple introduction events, comprising multiple cocirculating lineages in each year, including those that have circulated in the Middle East and those whose origins likely lie on different continents. At the scale of individual hosts, the majority of minor variants resulted from <i>de novo</i> mutation, with only limited evidence of minor variant transmission or minor variants circulating at subconsensus level despite the likely identification of multiple transmission clusters. Together, these data highlight the complexity of influenza virus infection at the Hajj pilgrimages, reflecting a mix of global genetic diversity drawn from multiple sources combined with local transmission, and reemphasize the need for vigilant surveillance at mass gatherings.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Large population sizes and densities at mass gatherings such as the Hajj (Makkah, Saudi Arabia) can contribute to outbreaks of respiratory virus infection by providing local hot spots for transmission followed by spread to other localities. Using a genome-scale analysis, we show that the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses at the Hajj gatherings during 2013 to 2015 was largely shaped by the introduction of multiple viruses from diverse geographic regions, including the Middle East, with only little evidence of interhost virus transmission at the Hajj and seemingly limited spread of subconsensus mutational variants. The diversity of viruses at the Hajj pilgrimages highlights the potential for lineage cocirculation during mass gatherings, in turn fuelling segment reassortment and the emergence of novel variants, such that the continued surveillance of respiratory pathogens at mass gatherings should be a public health priority.

Title: Identification of Two novel reassortant avian influenza a (H5N6) viruses in whooper swans in Korea, 2016.
Abstract: On November 20, 2016 two novel strains of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIVs) were isolated from three whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) at Gangjin Bay in South Jeolla province, South Korea. Identification of HPAIVs in wild birds is significant as there is a potential risk of transmission of these viruses to poultry and humans. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses classified into Asian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage and were distinguishable from H5N8 and H5N1 HPAIVs previously isolated in Korea. With the exception of the polymerase acidic (PA) gene, the viruses were most closely related to A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90 ~ 99.74%). The PA genes of the two novel Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to AIV isolates previously characterized from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) (99.16%) and A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) (98.65%). The lack of more recent viruses to A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need for analysis of recent wild bird AIVs isolated in Korea because they might provide further clues as to the origin of these novel reassortant H5N6 viruses. Although research on the origins and epidemiology of these infections is ongoing, the most likely route of infection for the whooper swans was through direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses shed by migratory wild birds in Korea. As H5N6 HPAIVs can potentially be transmitted to poultry and humans, continuous monitoring of AIVs among wild birds will help to mitigate this risk.

Title: Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).
Abstract: Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, and affects the epidemiology of infectious diseases. However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population. We also demonstrate that AstroV might be a larger burden to urban ducks than IAV, and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses. The presence of economically relevant viruses in urban Mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments, which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife, food production animals, and humans.

Title: Phylogeographical characterization of H5N8 viruses isolated from poultry and wild birds during 2014-2016 in South Korea.
Abstract: During 2014–2016 HPAI outbreak in South Korea, H5N8 viruses have been mostly isolated in western areas of the country, which provide wintering habitats for wild birds and have a high density of poultry. Analysis of a total of 101 Korean isolates revealed that primitive H5N8 viruses (C0 group) have evolved into multiple genetic subgroups appearing from various epidemiological sources, namely, the viruses circulating in poultry farms (C1 and C5) and those reintroduced by migratory birds in late 2014 (C2 and C4). No C3 groups were detected. The results may explain the possible reasons of the recent long-term persistence of H5N8 viruses in South Korea, and help to develop the effective measures in controlling HPAI viruses.

Title: A novel benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30 inhibits influenza virus replication by depression of Inosine-5'-Monophospate Dehydrogenase activity.
Abstract: Influenza virus is still a huge threat to the world-wide public health. Host inosine-5'- monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) involved in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is known to be a potential target to inhibit the replication of viruses. Herein, we evaluated antiviral activity of a benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30, which was designed to inhibit IMPDH. The results demonstrated that N30 inhibited the replication of H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, including oseltamivir and amantadine resistant strains in vitro. Mechanistically, neuraminidase inhibition assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay suggested that N30 did not directly target the two envelope glycoproteins required for viral adsorption or release. Instead, the compound could depress the activity of IMPDH type II. Based on these findings, we further confirmed that N30 provided a strong inhibition on the replication of respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and a diverse strains of coxsackie B virus. We identified the small molecule N30, as an inhibitor of IMPDH, might be a potential candidate to inhibit the replication of various viruses.

Title: Evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of a BiondVax-developed universal influenza vaccine (Multimeric-001) either as a standalone vaccine or as a primer to H5N1 influenza vaccine: Phase IIb study protocol.
Abstract: Influenza is a major respiratory viral infection of humans with high mortality and morbidity rates and profound economic impact. Although influenza vaccines are generally updated yearly to match the viruses expected in the coming season, genetic mutation and reassortment can result in unexpected novel strains. Therefore, it is important to develop universal vaccines inducing protective immunity to such strains before they appear. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Multimeric-001 (M-001), which contains conserved epitopes of influenza A and B. M-001 is able to induce both humoral and cellular immunity and provides broad strain coverage. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and controlled phase IIb trial, 222 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years will be randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive either 2 intramuscular injections of 0.5 mg M-001 (arm 1), 1.0 mg M-001 (arm 2), or saline (arm 3-placebo), before receiving an investigational (whole virus, inactivated, aluminum phosphate gel [AlPO4]-adjuvanted) prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1). Primary outcomes are safety and cellular immune responses (cell-mediated immunity [CMI]) induced by M-001, evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry of intracellular cytokines. The secondary outcome is the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer toward the H5N1 vaccine strain. Additionally, exploratory outcomes include evaluation of CMI by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of cytokine mRNA, HAI titers toward H5-drifted strains, serum single radial hemolysis titers toward the H5N1 study vaccine, and the association between CMI markers and antibody response. There is a need for influenza vaccines that give the population a broader protection against multiple strains of influenza virus. M-001 might be such vaccine which will be tested in this current trial as a standalone vaccine and as a pandemic primer. Both cellular and humoral immune responses will be evaluated.

Title: Highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza A viruses recovered from wild birds in Guangdong, southern China, 2014-2015.
Abstract: Since 2013, highly pathogenic (HP) H5N6 influenza A viruses (IAVs) have emerged in poultry in Asia, especially Southeast Asia. These viruses have also caused sporadic infections in humans within the same geographic areas. Active IAV surveillance in wild birds sampled in Guangdong province, China from August 2014 through February 2015 resulted in the recovery of three H5N6 IAVs. These H5N6 IAV isolates possess the basic amino acid motif at the HA1-HA2 cleavage site that is associated with highly pathogenic IAVs infecting chickens. Noteworthy findings include: (1) the HP H5N6 IAV isolates were recovered from three species of apparently healthy wild birds (most other isolates of HP H5N6 IAV in Asia are recovered from dead wild birds or fecal samples in the environment) and (2) these isolates were apparently the first recoveries of HP H5N6 IAV for two of the three species thus expanding the demonstrated natural host range for these lineages of virus. This investigation provides additional insight into the natural history of HP H5N6 IAVs and identifies the occurrence of non-lethal, HP H5N6 IAV infections in wild birds thereby demonstrating the value of active IAV surveillance in wild birds.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza viruses in South Korea between 2012 and 2014.
Abstract: National surveillance of avian influenza virus (AIV) in South Korea has been annually conducted for the early detection of AIV and responses to the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. In this study, we report on a nationwide surveillance study of AIV in domestic poultry and wild birds in South Korea between 2012 and 2014. During the surveillance programs between 2012 and 2014, 141,560 samples were collected. Of these, 102,199 were from poultry farms, 8215 were from LBMs, and 31,146 were from wild bird habitats. The virus isolation was performed by inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs and AIV isolates were detected using hemagglutination assay. For subtying of AIV, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were confirmed by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the H5 subtypes was performed using 28 H5 AIV isolates. Between 2012 and 2014, a total of 819 AIV were isolated from 141,560 samples. Virus isolation rates for AIV were 0.6, 0.4, 0.1, and 2.7% in wild birds (n = 202), domestic ducks (n = 387), minor poultry (n = 11), and the live bird market (LBM) (n = 219), respectively. In wild birds, various subtypes were found including H1-H7 and H9-H13. The major subtypes were H5 (n = 48, 23.9%: N3 (n = 4) and N8 (n = 44)), H4 (n = 39, 19.4%), and H1 (n = 29, 14.4%). In domestic poultry, mainly ducks, the H5N8 (n = 275, 59.3%), H3 (n = 30, 17.2%), and H6 (n = 53, 11.4%) subtypes were predominantly found. The most frequently detected subtypes in LBM, primarily Korean native chicken, were H9 (n = 169, 77.2%). H3 (n = 10, 4%) and H6 (n = 30, 13.7%) were also isolated in LBM. Overall, the prevalence of AIV was found to be higher between winter and spring and in western parts of South Korea. The unusual high prevalence of the H5 subtype of AIV was due to the large scale outbreak of H5N8 HPAI in wild birds and domestic poultry in 2014. Enhanced surveillance and application of effective control measures in wild birds and domestic poultry, including LBM, should be implemented to control AI and eradicate HPAI.

Title: Cellular protein GLTSCR2: A valuable target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.
Abstract: Viral infection induces translocation of the nucleolar protein GLTSCR2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in attenuation of the type I interferon IFN-β. Addressing the role of GLTSCR2 in viral replication, we detect that knocking down GLTSCR2 by shRNAs results in significant suppression of viral replication in mammalian and chicken cells. Injection of chicken embryo with the GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially reduces viral replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Injection of shRNA-1370 into chicken embryo also reduces the replication of avian influenza virus (AIV). In contrast, GLTSCR2-derived protein G4-T, forming α-helical dimers, increases replication of seven various DNA and RNA viruses in cells. Our studies reveal that alteration of the function of cellular GLTSCR2 plays a role in supporting viral replication. GLTSCR2 should be seriously considered as a therapeutic target for developing broad spectrum antiviral agents to effectively control viral infection.

Title: Comparative Epidemiology of Human Fatal Infections with Novel, High (H5N6 and H5N1) and Low (H7N9 and H9N2) Pathogenicity Avian Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: This study aimed to assess the mortality risks for human infection with high (HPAI) and low (LPAI) pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. The HPAI case fatality rate (CFR) was far higher than the LPAI CFR [66.0% (293/444) vs. 68.75% (11/16) vs. 40.4% (265/656) vs. 0.0% (0/18) in the cases with H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001]. Similarly, the CFR of the index cases was greater than the secondary cases with H5N1 [100% (43/43) vs. 43.3% (42/97), <i>p</i> < 0.001]. Old age [22.5 vs. 17 years for H5N1, <i>p</i> = 0.018; 61 vs. 49 years for H7H9, <i>p</i> < 0.001], concurrent diseases [18.8% (15/80) vs. 8.33% (9/108) for H5N1, <i>p</i> = 0.046; 58.6% (156/266) vs. 34.8% (135/388) for H7H9, <i>p</i> < 0.001], delayed confirmation [13 vs. 6 days for H5N1, <i>p</i> < 0.001; 10 vs. 8 days for H7N9, <i>p</i> = 0.011] in the fatalities and survivors, were risk factors for deaths. With regard to the H5N1 clusters, exposure to poultry [67.4% (29/43) vs. 45.2% (19/42), <i>p</i> = 0.039] was the higher risk for the primary than the secondary deaths. In conclusion, old age, comorbidities, delayed confirmation, along with poultry exposure are the major risks contributing to fatal outcomes in human HPAI and LPAI infections.

Title: Identification of small molecule inhibitors for influenza a virus using in silico and in vitro approaches.
Abstract: Influenza viruses have acquired resistance to approved neuraminidase-targeting drugs, increasing the need for new drug targets for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs. Nucleoprotein (NP) is an attractive target since it has an indispensable role in virus replication and its amino acid sequence is well conserved. In this study, we aimed to identify new inhibitors of the NP using a structure-based drug discovery algorithm, named Nagasaki University Docking Engine (NUDE), which has been established especially for the Destination for GPU Intensive Machine (DEGIMA) supercomputer. The hit compounds that showed high binding scores during in silico screening were subsequently evaluated for anti-influenza virus effects using a cell-based assay. A 4-hydroxyquinolinone compound, designated as NUD-1, was found to inhibit the replication of influenza virus in cultured cells. Analysis of binding between NUD-1 and NP using surface plasmon resonance assay and fragment molecular orbital calculations confirmed that NUD-1 binds to NP and could interfere with NP-NP interactions essential for virus replication. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the compound inhibited the mid-stage of infection, corresponding to assembly of the NP and other viral proteins. Moreover, NUD-1 was also effective against various types of influenza A viruses including a clinical isolate of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza with a 50% inhibitory concentration range of 1.8-2.1 μM. Our data demonstrate that the combined use of NUDE system followed by the cell-based assay is useful to obtain lead compounds for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2) is required for membrane fusion during influenza virus entry.
Abstract: Influenza viruses exploit host factors to successfully replicate in infected cells. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, we identified six human genes required for influenza A virus (IAV) replication. Here we focused on the role of acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2), as its knockdown showed the greatest inhibition of IAV replication. In IAV-infected cells, depletion of ACP2 resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of viral proteins and mRNA, and led to the attenuation of virus multi-cycle growth. ACP2 knockdown also decreased replication of seasonal influenza A and B viruses and avian IAVs of the H7 subtype. Interestingly, ACP2 depletion had no effect on the replication of Ebola or hepatitis C virus. Because ACP2 is known to be a lysosomal acid phosphatase, we assessed the role of ACP2 in influenza virus entry. While neither binding of the viral particle to the cell surface nor endosomal acidification was affected in ACP2-depleted cells, fusion of the endosomal and viral membranes was impaired. As a result, downstream steps in viral entry were blocked, including nucleocapsid uncoating and nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins. Our results established ACP2 as a necessary host factor for regulating the fusion step of influenza virus entry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of a host factor (ACP2) in influenza virus entry and replication, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Lateral Organization of Influenza Virus Proteins in the Budozone Region of the Plasma Membrane.
Abstract: Influenza virus assembles and buds at the plasma membrane of virus-infected cells. The viral proteins assemble at the same site on the plasma membrane for budding to occur. This involves a complex web of interactions among viral proteins. Some proteins, like hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and M2, are integral membrane proteins. M1 is peripherally membrane associated, whereas NP associates with viral RNA to form an RNP complex that associates with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, HA and NP have been shown to be concentrated in cholesterol-rich membrane raft domains, whereas M2, although containing a cholesterol binding motif, is not raft associated. Here we identify viral proteins in planar sheets of plasma membrane using immunogold staining. The distribution of these proteins was examined individually and pairwise by using the Ripley K function, a type of nearest-neighbor analysis. Individually, HA, NA, M1, M2, and NP were shown to self-associate in or on the plasma membrane. HA and M2 are strongly coclustered in the plasma membrane; however, in the case of NA and M2, clustering depends upon the expression system used. Despite both proteins being raft resident, HA and NA occupy distinct but adjacent membrane domains. M2 and M1 strongly cocluster, but the association of M1 with HA or NA is dependent upon the means of expression. The presence of HA and NP at the site of budding depends upon the coexpression of other viral proteins. Similarly, M2 and NP occupy separate compartments, but an association can be bridged by the coexpression of M1.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The complement of influenza virus proteins necessary for the budding of progeny virions needs to accumulate at budozones. This is complicated by HA and NA residing in lipid raft-like domains, whereas M2, although an integral membrane protein, is not raft associated. Other necessary protein components such as M1 and NP are peripherally associated with the membrane. Our data define spatial relationships between viral proteins in the plasma membrane. Some proteins, such as HA and M2, inherently cocluster within the membrane, although M2 is found mostly at the periphery of regions of HA, consistent with the proposed role of M2 in scission at the end of budding. The association between some pairs of influenza virus proteins, such as M2 and NP, appears to be brokered by additional influenza virus proteins, in this case M1. HA and NA, while raft associated, reside in distinct domains, reflecting their distributions in the viral membrane.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on spatial organization and interactions of influenza virus proteins in the plasma membrane, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The PA Endonuclease Inhibitor RO-7 Protects Mice from Lethal Challenge with Influenza A or B Viruses.
Abstract: Current influenza treatment relies on a single class of antiviral drugs, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), raising concern over the potential emergence of resistant variants and necessitating the development of novel drugs. In recent years, investigational inhibitors targeting the endonuclease activity of the influenza acidic polymerase (PA) protein have yielded encouraging results, although there are only limited data on their <i>in vivo</i> efficacy. Here, we examined the antiviral potential of the PA endonuclease inhibitor RO-7 in prophylactic and therapeutic regimens in BALB/c mice inoculated with influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 or B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses, which represent currently circulating antigenic variants. RO-7 was administered to mice intraperitoneally twice daily at dosages of 6, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days, starting 4 h before or 24 or 48 h after virus inoculation, and showed no adverse effects. Prophylactic administration completely protected mice from lethal infection by influenza A or B virus. The level of therapeutic protection conferred depended upon the time of treatment initiation and RO-7 dosage, resulting in 60 to 100% and 80 to 100% survival with influenza A and B viruses, respectively. RO-7 treatment significantly decreased virus titers in the lung and lessened the extent and severity of lung damage. No PA endonuclease-inhibitor resistance was observed in viruses isolated from lungs of RO-7-treated mice, and the viruses remained susceptible to the drug at nanomolar concentrations in phenotypic assays. These <i>in vivo</i> efficacy results further highlight the potential of RO-7 for development as antiviral therapy for influenza A and B virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral efficacy of a PA endonuclease inhibitor in mice but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: H1N1 influenza vaccination in HIV-infected women on effective antiretroviral treatment did not induce measurable antigen-driven proliferation of the HIV-1 proviral reservoir.
Abstract: Antigen-induced activation and proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells is hypothesized to be a mechanism of HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy. The objective of this study was to determine if proliferation of H1N1-specific HIV-infected cells could be detected following H1N1 vaccination. This study utilized cryopreserved PBMC from a previously conducted trial of H1N1 vaccination in HIV-infected pregnant women. HIV-1 DNA concentrations and 437 HIV-1 C2V5 env DNA sequences were analyzed from ten pregnant women on effective antiretroviral therapy, before and 21 days after H1N1 influenza vaccination. HIV-1 DNA concentration did not change after vaccination (median pre- vs. post-vaccination: 95.77 vs. 41.28 copies/million PBMC, p = .37). Analyses of sequences did not detect evidence of HIV replication or proliferation of infected cells. Antigenic stimulation during effective ART did not have a detectable effect on the genetic makeup of the HIV-1 DNA reservoir. Longitudinal comparison of the amount and integration sites of HIV-1 in antigen-specific cells to chronic infections (such as herpesviruses) may be needed to definitively evaluate whether antigenic stimulation induces proliferation of HIV-1 infected cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates HIV-1 proviral reservoir dynamics post-vaccination without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Expeditious Lead Optimization of Isoxazole-Containing Influenza A Virus M2-S31N Inhibitors Using the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction.
Abstract: The existence of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses, coupled with the continuously antigenic shift and antigenic drift of influenza viruses, necessitates the development of the next-generation of influenza antivirals. As the AM2-S31N mutant persists in more than 95% of current circulating influenza A viruses, targeting the AM2-S31N proton channel appears to be a logical and valid approach to combating drug resistance. Starting from compound 1, an isoxazole compound with potent AM2-S31N channel blockage and antiviral activity, in this study we report an expeditious synthetic strategy that allows us to promptly explore the structure-activity relationships of isoxazole-containing AM2-S31N inhibitors. Propelled by the convenient synthesis, the lead optimization effort yielded a number of potent antivirals with submicromolar efficacy against several human clinical isolates of influenza A viruses, including both oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on chemical synthesis and antiviral activity of inhibitors targeting a viral protein mutation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bayesian phylogeography of influenza A/H3N2 for the 2014-15 season in the United States using three frameworks of ancestral state reconstruction.
Abstract: Ancestral state reconstructions in Bayesian phylogeography of virus pandemics have been improved by utilizing a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) framework. Recently, this framework has been extended to model the transition rate matrix between discrete states as a generalized linear model (GLM) of genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors of interest to the virus and incorporating BSSVS to estimate the posterior inclusion probabilities of each predictor. Although the latter appears to enhance the biological validity of ancestral state reconstruction, there has yet to be a comparison of phylogenies created by the two methods. In this paper, we compare these two methods, while also using a primitive method without BSSVS, and highlight the differences in phylogenies created by each. We test six coalescent priors and six random sequence samples of H3N2 influenza during the 2014-15 flu season in the U.S. We show that the GLMs yield significantly greater root state posterior probabilities than the two alternative methods under five of the six priors, and significantly greater Kullback-Leibler divergence values than the two alternative methods under all priors. Furthermore, the GLMs strongly implicate temperature and precipitation as driving forces of this flu season and nearly unanimously identified a single root state, which exhibits the most tropical climate during a typical flu season in the U.S. The GLM, however, appears to be highly susceptible to sampling bias compared with the other methods, which casts doubt on whether its reconstructions should be favored over those created by alternate methods. We report that a BSSVS approach with a Poisson prior demonstrates less bias toward sample size under certain conditions than the GLMs or primitive models, and believe that the connection between reconstruction method and sampling bias warrants further investigation.

Reason: The study focuses on phylogeographic methods and ancestral state reconstruction without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Vaccination has minimal impact on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses.
Abstract: While influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, the factors that influence the virus' rapid evolution within and between human hosts are less clear. Given the modest effectiveness of seasonal vaccination, vaccine-induced antibody responses could serve as a potent selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. Importantly, this study design allowed us to isolate the impact of vaccination while still studying natural infection. We used pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers to quantify vaccine-induced immunity directly and to assess its impact on intrahost populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 5119 person-years. We obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples and used a stringent and empirically validated analysis pipeline to identify intrahost single nucleotide variants at ≥1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season HAI and NAI titer, respectively. In our study population, we found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems, our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the impact of vaccination on intrahost viral diversity but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification of 5-Methoxy-2-(Diformylmethylidene)-3,3-Dimethylindole as an Anti-Influenza A Virus Agent.
Abstract: Influenza virus is estimated to cause 3-5 million severe complications and about 250-500 thousand deaths per year. Different kinds of anti-influenza virus drugs have been developed. However, the emergence of drug resistant strains has presented a big challenge for efficient antiviral therapy. Indole derivatives have been shown to exhibit both antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we adopted a cell-based system to screen for potential anti-IAV agents. Four indole derivatives (named 525A, 526A, 527A and 528A) were subjected to the antiviral screening, of which 526A was selected for further investigation. We reported that pre-treating cells with 526A protects cells from IAV infection. Furthermore, 526A inhibits IAV replication by inhibiting the expression of IAV genes. Interestingly, 526A suppresses the activation of IRF3 and STAT1 in host cells and thus represses the production of type I interferon response and cytokines in IAV-infected cells. Importantly, 526A also partially blocks the activation of RIG-I pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that 526A may be a potential anti-influenza A virus agent.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral activity of a compound inhibiting viral replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of the human antibody repertoire reveals quantitative signatures of immune senescence and aging.
Abstract: The elderly have reduced humoral immunity, as manifested by increased susceptibility to infections and impaired vaccine responses. To investigate the effects of aging on B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire evolution during an immunological challenge, we used a phylogenetic distance metric to analyze Ig heavy-chain transcript sequences in both young and elderly individuals before and after influenza vaccination. We determined that BCR repertoires become increasingly specialized over a span of decades, but less plastic. In 50% of the elderly individuals, a large space in the repertoire was occupied by a small number of recall lineages that did not decline during vaccine response and contained hypermutated IgD<sup>+</sup> B cells. Relative to their younger counterparts, older subjects demonstrated a contracted naive repertoire and diminished intralineage diversification, signifying a reduced substrate for mounting novel responses and decreased fine-tuning of BCR specificities by somatic hypermutation. Furthermore, a larger proportion of the repertoire exhibited premature stop codons in some elderly subjects, indicating that aging may negatively affect the ability of B cells to discriminate between functional and nonfunctional receptors. Finally, we observed a decreased incidence of radical mutations compared with conservative mutations in elderly subjects' vaccine responses, which suggests that accumulating original antigenic sin may be limiting the accessible space for paratope evolution. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of environmental and gerontological factors affecting immune senescence, and provide direct molecular characterization of the effects of senescence on the immune repertoire.

Reason: The study analyzes human antibody repertoire aging but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Infection by Fucoidan Targeting Viral Neuraminidase and Cellular EGFR Pathway.
Abstract: Development of novel anti-influenza A virus (IAV) drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity is critical for preparedness against influenza outbreaks. Herein, we investigated the anti-IAV activities and mechanisms of fucoidan in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that a fucoidan KW derived from brown algae Kjellmaniella crassifolia effectively blocked IAV infection in vitro with low toxicity. KW possessed broad anti-IAV spectrum and low tendency of induction of viral resistance, superior to the anti-IAV drug amantadine. KW was capable of inactivating virus particles before infection and blocked some stages after adsorption. KW could bind to viral neuraminidase (NA) and inhibit the activity of NA to block the release of IAV. KW also interfered with the activation of EGFR, PKCα, NF-κB, and Akt, and inhibited both IAV endocytosis and EGFR internalization in IAV-infected cells, suggesting that KW may also inhibit cellular EGFR pathway. Moreover, intranasal administration of KW markedly improved survival and decreased viral titers in IAV-infected mice. Therefore, fucoidan KW has the potential to be developed into a novel nasal drop or spray for prevention and treatment of influenza in the future.

Title: Alveolar Macrophages Prevent Lethal Influenza Pneumonia By Inhibiting Infection Of Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: The Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen that produces significant morbidity and mortality. To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages (AlvMΦs) in regulating the severity of IAV infection we employed a murine model in which the Core Binding Factor Beta gene is conditionally disrupted in myeloid cells. These mice exhibit a selective deficiency in AlvMΦs. Following IAV infection these AlvMΦ deficient mice developed severe diffuse alveolar damage, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury in these mice resulted from increased infection of their Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells (T1AECs) and the subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune T cell response. Further analysis indicated AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of the cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes in a T1AECs cell line reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection, suggesting that AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of this pathway contributes to the resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. Furthermore, inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes, as well as blockade of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in the AlvMΦ deficient mice reduced the susceptibility of their T1AECs to IAV infection and protected these mice from lethal infection. These results suggest that AlvMΦs may utilize a previously unappreciated mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection, and thereby reduce the severity of infection. The findings further suggest that the cysLT pathway and the receptors for cysLT metabolites represent potential therapeutic targets in severe IAV infection.

Title: Novel real-time PCR-based patho- and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza A subtype H5 viruses at risk of incursion into Europe in 2017.
Abstract: Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities. Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5 viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.

Title: Molecular Evidence of Transmission of Influenza A/H1N1 2009 on a University Campus.
Abstract: In the recent years, the data on the molecular epidemiology of influenza viruses have expanded enormously because of the availability of cutting-edge sequencing technologies. However, much of the information is from the temperate regions with few studies from tropical regions such as South-east Asia. Despite the fact that influenza has been known to transmit rapidly within semi-closed communities, such as military camps and educational institutions, data are limited from these communities. To determine the phylogeography of influenza viruses on a university campus, we examined the spatial distribution of influenza virus on the National University of Singapore (NUS) campus. Consenting students from the NUS who sought medical attention at the UHC provided two nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic data. PCR was used for detection of influenza viruses. 34 full-genomes of pH1N1/09 viruses were successfully sequenced by Sanger method and concatenated using Geneious R7. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using these 34 sequences and 1518 global sequences. Phylogeographic analysis was done using BaTS software and Association index and Fitch parsimony scores were determined. Integrating whole genome sequencing data with epidemiological data, we found strong evidence of influenza transmission on campus as isolates from students residing on-campus were highly similar to each other (AI, P value = 0.009; PS, P value = 0.04). There was also evidence of multiple introductions from the community. Such data are useful in formulating pandemic preparedness plans which can use these communities as sentinel sites for detection and monitoring of emerging respiratory viral infections.

Title: Optimization of a Quantitative Micro-neutralization Assay.
Abstract: The micro-neutralization (MN) assay is a standard technique for measuring the infectivity of the influenza virus and the inhibition of virus replication. In this study, we present the protocol of an imaging-based MN assay to quantify the true antigenic relationships between viruses. Unlike typical plaque reduction assays that rely on visible plaques, this assay quantitates the entire infected cell population of each well. The protocol matches the virus type or subtype with the selection of cell lines to achieve maximum infectivity, which enhances sample contrast during imaging and image processing. The introduction of quantitative titration defines the amount of input viruses of neutralization and enables the results from different experiments to be comparable. The imaging setup with a flatbed scanner and free downloadable software makes the approach high throughput, cost effective, user friendly, and easy to deploy in most laboratories. Our study demonstrates that the improved MN assay works well with the current circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses, without being significantly influenced by amino acid substitutions in the neuraminidase (NA) of A(H3N2) viruses. It is particularly useful for the characterization of viruses that either grow to low HA titer and/or undergo an abortive infection resulting in an inability to form plaques in cultured cells.

Title: Unrestrained AMPylation targets cytosolic chaperones and activates the heat shock response.
Abstract: Protein AMPylation is a conserved posttranslational modification with emerging roles in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. However, the range of substrates and cell biological consequences of AMPylation remain poorly defined. We expressed human and Caenorhabditis elegans AMPylation enzymes-huntingtin yeast-interacting protein E (HYPE) and filamentation-induced by cyclic AMP (FIC)-1, respectively-in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a eukaryote that lacks endogenous protein AMPylation. Expression of HYPE and FIC-1 in yeast induced a strong cytoplasmic Hsf1-mediated heat shock response, accompanied by attenuation of protein translation, massive protein aggregation, growth arrest, and lethality. Overexpression of Ssa2, a cytosolic heat shock protein (Hsp)70, was sufficient to partially rescue growth. In human cell lines, overexpression of active HYPE similarly induced protein aggregation and the HSF1-dependent heat shock response. Excessive AMPylation also abolished HSP70-dependent influenza virus replication. Our findings suggest a mode of Hsp70 inactivation by AMPylation and point toward a role for protein AMPylation in the regulation of cellular protein homeostasis beyond the endoplasmic reticulum.

Title: Risk assessment of recent Egyptian H5N1 influenza viruses.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype are enzootic in poultry populations in different parts of the world, and have caused numerous human infections in recent years, particularly in Egypt. However, no sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses has yet been reported. We tested nine naturally occurring Egyptian H5N1 viruses (isolated in 2014-2015) in ferrets and found that three of them transmitted via respiratory droplets, causing a fatal infection in one of the exposed animals. All isolates were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. However, these viruses were not transmitted via respiratory droplets in three additional transmission experiments in ferrets. Currently, we do not know if the efficiency of transmission is very low or if subtle differences in experimental parameters contributed to these inconsistent results. Nonetheless, our findings heighten concern regarding the pandemic potential of recent Egyptian H5N1 influenza viruses.

Title: Monitoring the fitness of antiviral-resistant influenza strains during an epidemic: a mathematical modelling study.
Abstract: Antivirals (eg, oseltamivir) are important for mitigating influenza epidemics. In 2007, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza seasonal A H1N1 strain emerged and spread to global fixation within 1 year. This event showed that antiviral-resistant (AVR) strains can be intrinsically more transmissible than their contemporaneous antiviral-sensitive (AVS) counterpart. Surveillance of AVR fitness is therefore essential. Our objective was to develop a simple method for estimating AVR fitness from surveillance data. We defined the fitness of AVR strains as their reproductive number relative to their co-circulating AVS counterparts. We developed a simple method for real-time estimation of AVR fitness from surveillance data. This method requires only information on generation time without other specific details regarding transmission dynamics. We first used simulations to validate this method by showing that it yields unbiased and robust fitness estimates in most epidemic scenarios. We then applied this method to two retrospective case studies and one hypothetical case study. We estimated that the oseltamivir-resistant A H1N1 strain that emerged in 2007 was 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3-5) more transmissible than its oseltamivir-sensitive predecessor and the oseltamivir-resistant pandemic A H1N1 strain that emerged and circulated in Japan during 2013-14 was 24% (95% CrI 17-30) less transmissible than its oseltamivir-sensitive counterpart. We show that in the event of large-scale antiviral interventions during a pandemic with co-circulation of AVS and AVR strains, our method can be used to inform optimal use of antivirals by monitoring intrinsic AVR fitness and drug pressure on the AVS strain. We developed a simple method that can be easily integrated into contemporary influenza surveillance systems to provide reliable estimates of AVR fitness in real time.

Title: Predominance and geo-mapping of avian influenza H5N1 in poultry sectors in Egypt.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype has been enzootic in the Egyptian poultry with significant human infections since 2008. This work evaluates the epidemiological and virological information from February 2006 to May 2015 in spatial and temporal terms. Only data with confirmed HPAI H5N1 sub-type were collected, and matched with the epidemiological data from various spatially and temporally-dispersed surveillances implemented between 2006 and 2015. Spatio-temporal analysis was conducted on a total of 3338 confirmed H5N1 HPAI poultry disease outbreaks and outputs described based on transmission patterns, poultry species, production types affected, trade, geographic and temporal distributions in Egypt. The H5N1 virus persists in the Egyptian poultry displaying a seasonal pattern with peak prevalence between January and March. There was no specific geographic pattern, but chickens and ducks were more affected. However, relatively higher disease incidences were recorded in the Nile Delta. Phylogenetic studies of the haemagglutinin gene sequences of H5N1 viruses indicated that multiple clusters circulated between 2006 and 2015, with significant deviations in circulation. Epidemiological dynamics of HPAI has changed with the origins of majority of outbreaks shifted to household poultry. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 in poultry with recurrent and sporadic infections in humans can influence virus evolution spatio-temporally. Household poultry plays significant roles in the H5N1 virus transmission to poultry and humans, but the role of commercial poultry needs further clarifications. While poultry trading supports the persistence and transmission of H5N1, the role of individual species may warrant further investigation. Surveillance activities, applying a multi-sectoral approach, are recommended.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 outbreaks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral Efficacy of Verdinexor In Vivo in Two Animal Models of Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics of respiratory illness that can cause mild to severe illness and potentially death. Antiviral drugs are an important countermeasure against IAV; however, drug resistance has developed, thus new therapeutic approaches are being sought. Previously, we demonstrated the antiviral activity of a novel nuclear export inhibitor drug, verdinexor, to reduce influenza replication in vitro and pulmonary virus burden in mice. In this study, in vivo efficacy of verdinexor was further evaluated in two animal models or influenza virus infection, mice and ferrets. In mice, verdinexor was efficacious to limit virus shedding, reduce pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and moderate leukocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space. Similarly, verdinexor-treated ferrets had reduced lung pathology, virus burden, and inflammatory cytokine expression in the nasal wash exudate. These findings support the anti-viral efficacy of verdinexor, and warrant its development as a novel antiviral therapeutic for influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral efficacy of a drug in animal models but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibitory effects of bee venom and its components against viruses in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Bee venom (BV) from honey bee (Apis Melifera L.) contains at least 18 pharmacologically active components including melittin (MLT), phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>), and apamin etc. BV is safe for human treatments dose dependently and proven to possess different healing properties including antibacterial and antiparasitidal properties. Nevertheless, antiviral properties of BV have not well investigated. Hence, we identified the potential antiviral properties of BV and its component against a broad panel of viruses. Co-incubation of non-cytotoxic amounts of BV and MLT, the main component of BV, significantly inhibited the replication of enveloped viruses such as Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Additionally, BV and MLT also inhibited the replication of non-enveloped viruses such as Enterovirus-71 (EV-71) and Coxsackie Virus (H3). Such antiviral properties were mainly explained by virucidal mechanism. Moreover, MLT protected mice which were challenged with lethal doses of pathogenic influenza A H1N1 viruses. Therefore, these results provides the evidence that BV and MLT could be a potential source as a promising antiviral agent, especially to develop as a broad spectrum antiviral agent.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates antiviral effects of bee venom components but does not analyze viral genotypes or link them to phenotypes.

Title: Effect of Live Poultry Market Interventions on Influenza A(H7N9) Virus, Guangdong, China.
Abstract: Since March 2013, three waves of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been detected in China. To investigate virus transmission within and across epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong during 2013-2015. We observed a geographic shift of human A(H7N9) infections from the second to the third waves. Live poultry market interventions were undertaken in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis indicated that the third-wave outbreaks in central Guangdong most likely resulted from local virus persistence rather than introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of clinical cases in humans declined by 35% from the second to the third waves, the genetic diversity of third-wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk to a region reporting comparatively few A(H7N9) cases. Moreover, our results suggest that live-poultry market interventions cannot completely halt A(H7N9) virus persistence and dissemination.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes epidemiology and phylogenetics of H7N9 virus outbreaks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Origin, distribution, and potential risk factors associated with influenza A virus in swine in two production systems in Guatemala.
Abstract: Guatemala is the country with the largest swine production in Central America; however, evidence of influenza A virus (IAV) in pigs has not been clearly delineated. In this study, we analyzed the presence and spatial distribution of IAV in commercial and backyard swine populations. Samples from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were tested using virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays to detect IAV. Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% of the sampled pigs (30.6% of herds) in 2010 and in 11.7% (24.2% of herds) in 2011. The percentage of seropositive pigs was 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) for each year, respectively. Three pandemic H1N1 and one seasonal human-like H3N2 viruses were isolated. Antibodies against viruses from different genetic clusters were detected. No reassortant strains with swine viruses were detected. The H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses that circulated in Central America in 2010, distinct to the most recent human seasonal vaccine lineages. Spatial clusters of rRT-PCR positive herds were detected each year by scan statistics. Our results demonstrate circulation of IAV throughout Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status, and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. Detection of human-origin viruses in pigs suggests a role for humans in the molecular epidemiology of IAV in swine in Guatemala and evidences gaps in local animal and human surveillance.

Title: Regulation of kynurenine biosynthesis during influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) remain serious threats to public health because of the shortage of effective means of control. Developing more effective virus control modalities requires better understanding of virus-host interactions. It has previously been shown that IAV induces the production of kynurenine, which suppresses T-cell responses, enhances pain hypersensitivity and disturbs behaviour in infected animals. However, the regulation of kynurenine biosynthesis during IAV infection remains elusive. Here we showed that IAV infection induced expression of interferons (IFNs), which upregulated production of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), which catalysed the kynurenine biosynthesis. Furthermore, IAV attenuated the IDO1 expression and the production of kynurenine through its NS1 protein. Interestingly, inhibition of viral replication prior to IFN induction limited IDO1 expression, while inhibition after did not. Finally, we showed that kynurenine biosynthesis was activated in macrophages in response to other stimuli, such as influenza B virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Thus, the tight regulation of the kynurenine biosynthesis by host cell and, perhaps, pathogen might be a basic signature of a wide range of host-pathogen interactions, which should be taken into account during development of novel antiviral and antibacterial drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies host kynurenine biosynthesis regulation during infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Collectins, H-ficolin and LL-37 reduce influence viral replication in human monocytes and modulate virus-induced cytokine production.
Abstract: Infiltrating activated monocytes are important mediators of damaging inflammation during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We show that soluble respiratory proteins [collectins, surfactant proteins D (SP-D) and mannose binding lectin (MBL), H-ficolin and LL-37] inhibit replication of seasonal IAV in human monocytes. The collectins and H-ficolin also increased viral uptake by the cells, while LL-37 did not. H-ficolin was able to inhibit replication of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (Cal09) in monocytes, but SP-D and LL-37 had significantly fewer inhibitory effects on this strain than on seasonal IAV. All of these proteins reduced IAV-induced TNF-α production, even in instances when viral replication was not reduced. We used modified recombinant versions of SP-D, MBL and ficolin to elucidate mechanisms through which these proteins alter monocyte interactions with IAV. We demonstrate the importance of the multimeric structure, and of binding properties of the lectin domain, in mediating antiviral and opsonic activity of the proteins. Hence, soluble inhibitors present in airway lining fluid may aid clearance of IAV by promoting monocyte uptake of the virus, while reducing viral replication and virus-induced TNF-α responses in these cells. However, SP-D and LL-37 have reduced ability to inhibit replication of pandemic IAV in monocytes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates effects of host soluble proteins on viral replication and cytokine production but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF PANDEMIC INFLUENZA A(H1N1)PDM09 IN BRAZIL, 2009 - 2010.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses undergo frequent antigenic mutations and may thus cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. The aim of this study was to recover the epidemiological history of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Brazil. A descriptive study was conducted in 2009-2010. The Brazilian Information System for reportable diseases (SINAN) was the data source. A total of 105,054 suspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were reported to SINAN. Of these, 53,797 (51.2%) were classified as the new influenza virus subtype. Among the confirmed cases, 56.7% were female, the mean age was 26.31 (SD ± 18.1) years. Fever was the most common sign among the confirmed cases (99.7%) and the presence of comorbidities was reported in 32.5% of cases. In 2009 there were confirmed cases in all 26 Brazilian States and the Federal District. The incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of severe influenza in the population was 28.0 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010. The states of Paraná (301.3), Santa Catarina (36.0) and Rio Grande do Sul (27.4) presented the highest incidence; 46.4% of the confirmed cases were hospitalized and 47,643 were cured (93.8%). The case-fatality rate was 3.9% in 2009. The pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09 hit Brazil between April/2009 and December/2010 with an important difference in the geographic pattern distribution of the cases from the northeast to the south of the country. Children and young adults were the most affected. The limitations of the study were data quality and inconsistencies in the final classification of cases in SINAN. This study highlights the urgent need for improvements in the surveillance of emerging diseases in Brazil.

Title: Ecological dynamics of influenza A viruses: cross-species transmission and global migration.
Abstract: A comprehensive study of cross-species transmission and inter-regional migration would provide insights into the global ecology of influenza A viruses (IAVs). To this end, we assembled 17,241 non-redundant IAV whole-genome sequences with complete epidemiological information. We hierarchically divided the movements of IAVs into the cross-species transmission in each region and the inter-regional migration driven by each host species. We then systematically identified the potential cross-species transmission and inter-regional migration events. Cross-species transmission networks were obtained for each gene segment of the IAVs. Waterfowl, domestic birds and swine showed higher degrees of connection than did other species in all of the transmission networks. East Asia and Southeast Asia were hot regions for avian-mammal transmissions. Swine and migratory birds were the dominant species for global virus delivery. The importance of swine was reemphasized because it has not only provided an environment for adaptive evolution during the avian-human transmission of IAVs (as incubators) but also served as a key species for the global dissemination of the viruses (as carriers). Therefore, monitoring the global live trade of swine and survey of migratory birds along flyways would be beneficial for the prevention and control of IAVs.

Reason: The study focuses on ecological and transmission dynamics of influenza A viruses across species and regions without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Co-expression of sialic acid receptors compatible with avian and human influenza virus binding in emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae).
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to threaten animal and human health with constant emergence of novel variants. While aquatic birds are a major reservoir of most IAVs, the role of other terrestrial birds in the evolution of IAVs is becoming increasingly evident. Since 2006, several reports of IAV isolations from emus have surfaced and avian influenza infection of emus can lead to the selection of mammalian like PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N mutants. However, the potential of emus to be co-infected with avian and mammalian IAVs is not yet understood. As a first step, we investigated sialic acid (SA) receptor distribution across major organs and body systems of emu and found a widespread co-expression of both SAα2,3Gal and SAα2,6Gal receptors in various tissues that are compatible with avian and human IAV binding. Our results suggest that emus could allow genetic recombination and hence play an important role in the evolution of IAVs.

Reason: The paper investigates receptor distribution in emus relevant to influenza virus binding but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: --LUBAC deficiency perturbs TLR3 signaling to cause immunodeficiency and autoinflammation.
Abstract: The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of SHANK-associated RH-domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN), heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1), and HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP), is a critical regulator of inflammation and immunity. This is highlighted by the fact that patients with perturbed linear ubiquitination caused by mutations in the Hoip or Hoil-1 genes, resulting in knockouts of these proteins, may simultaneously suffer from immunodeficiency and autoinflammation. TLR3 plays a crucial, albeit controversial, role in viral infection and tissue damage. We identify a pivotal role of LUBAC in TLR3 signaling and discover a functional interaction between LUBAC components and TLR3 as crucial for immunity to influenza A virus infection. On the biochemical level, we identify LUBAC components as interacting with the TLR3-signaling complex (SC), thereby enabling TLR3-mediated gene activation. Absence of LUBAC components increases formation of a previously unrecognized TLR3-induced death-inducing SC, leading to enhanced cell death. Intriguingly, excessive TLR3-mediated cell death, induced by double-stranded RNA present in the skin of SHARPIN-deficient chronic proliferative dermatitis mice (cpdm), is a major contributor to their autoinflammatory skin phenotype, as genetic coablation of Tlr3 substantially ameliorated cpdm dermatitis. Thus, LUBAC components control TLR3-mediated innate immunity, thereby preventing development of immunodeficiency and autoinflammation.

Reason: This study focuses on host immune signaling pathways and their role in immunity and autoinflammation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The Microminipig as an Animal Model for Influenza A Virus Infection.
Abstract: Pigs are considered a mixing vessel for the generation of novel pandemic influenza A viruses through reassortment because of their susceptibility to both avian and human influenza viruses. However, experiments to understand reassortment in pigs in detail have been limited because experiments with regular-sized pigs are difficult to perform. Miniature pigs have been used as an experimental animal model, but they are still large and require relatively large cages for housing. The microminipig is one of the smallest miniature pigs used for experiments. Introduced in 2010, microminipigs weigh around 10 kg at an early stage of maturity (6 to 7 months old) and are easy to handle. To evaluate the microminipig as an animal model for influenza A virus infection, we compared the receptor distribution of 10-week-old male pigs (Yorkshire Large White) and microminipigs. We found that both animals have SAα2,3Gal and SAα2,6Gal in their respiratory tracts, with similar distributions of both receptor types. We further found that the sensitivity of microminipigs to influenza A viruses was the same as that of larger miniature pigs. Our findings indicate that the microminipig could serve as a novel model animal for influenza A virus infection. The microminipig is one of the smallest miniature pigs in the world and is used as an experimental animal model for life science research. In this study, we evaluated the microminipig as a novel animal model for influenza A virus infection. The distribution of influenza virus receptors in the respiratory tract of the microminipig was similar to that of the pig, and the sensitivity of microminipigs to influenza A viruses was the same as that of miniature pigs. Our findings suggest that microminipigs represent a novel animal model for influenza A virus infection.

Title: Modelling the impact of co-circulating low pathogenic avian influenza viruses on epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry.
Abstract: It is well known that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses emerge through mutation of precursor low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses in domestic poultry populations. The potential for immunological cross-protection between these pathogenic variants is recognised but the epidemiological impact during co-circulation is not well understood. Here we use mathematical models to investigate whether altered flock infection parameters consequent to primary LPAI infections can impact on the spread of HPAI at the population level. First we used mechanistic models reflecting the co-circulatory dynamics of LPAI and HPAI within a single commercial poultry flock. We found that primary infections with LPAI led to HPAI prevalence being maximised under a scenario of high but partial cross-protection. We then tested the population impact in spatially-explicit simulations motivated by a major avian influenza A(H7N1) epidemic that afflicted the Italian poultry industry in 1999-2001. We found that partial cross-protection can lead to a prolongation of HPAI epidemic duration. Our findings have implications for the control of HPAI in poultry particularly for settings in which LPAI and HPAI frequently co-circulate.

Title: 3DFlu: database of sequence and structural variability of the influenza hemagglutinin at population scale.
Abstract: The influenza virus type A (IVA) is an important pathogen which is able to cause annual epidemics and even pandemics. This fact is the consequence of the antigenic shifts and drifts capabilities of IVA, caused by the high mutation rate and the reassortment capabilities of the virus. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein constitutes the main IVA antigen and has a crucial role in the infection mechanism, being responsible for the recognition of host-specific sialic acid derivatives. Despite the relative abundance of HA sequence and serological studies, comparative structure-based analysis of HA are less investigated. The 3DFlu database contains well annotated HA representatives: 1192 models and 263 crystallographic structures. The relations between these proteins are defined using different metrics and are visualized as a network in the provided web interface. Moreover structural and sequence comparison of the proteins can be explored. Metadata information (e.g. protein identifier, IVA strain, year and location of infection) can enhance the exploration of the presented data. With our database researchers gain a useful tool for the exploration of high quality HA models, viewing and comparing changes in the HA viral subtypes at several information levels (sequence, structure, ESP). The complete and integrated view of those relations might be useful to determine the efficiency of transmission, pathogenicity and for the investigation of evolutionary tendencies of the influenza virus.Database URL: http://nucleus3d.cent.uw.edu.pl/influenza.

Title: Lack of virological and serological evidence for continued circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus in wild birds in the Netherlands, 14 November 2014 to 31 January 2016.
Abstract: In 2014, H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage emerged in poultry and wild birds in Asia, Europe and North America. Here, wild birds were extensively investigated in the Netherlands for HPAI H5N8 virus (real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the matrix and H5 gene) and antibody detection (haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralisation assays) before, during and after the first virus detection in Europe in late 2014. Between 21 February 2015 and 31 January 2016, 7,337 bird samples were tested for the virus. One HPAI H5N8 virus-infected Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) sampled on 25 February 2015 was detected. Serological assays were performed on 1,443 samples, including 149 collected between 2007 and 2013, 945 between 14 November 2014 and 13 May 2015, and 349 between 1 September and 31 December 2015. Antibodies specific for HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 were absent in wild bird sera obtained before 2014 and present in sera collected during and after the HPAI H5N8 emergence in Europe, with antibody incidence declining after the 2014/15 winter. Our results indicate that the HPAI H5N8 virus has not continued to circulate extensively in wild bird populations since the 2014/15 winter and that independent maintenance of the virus in these populations appears unlikely.

Title: Epidemiology of influenza B in Australia: 2001-2014 influenza seasons.
Abstract: Influenza B is characterised by two antigenic lineages: B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. These lineages circulate together with influenza A during influenza seasons, with varying incidence from year to year and by geographic region. To determine the epidemiology of influenza B relative to influenza A in Australia. Laboratory-confirmed influenza notifications between 2001 and 2014 in Australia were obtained from the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. A total of 278 485 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were notified during the study period, comprising influenza A (82.2%), B (17.1%) and 'other and untyped' (0.7%). The proportion of notifications that were influenza B was highest in five- to nine-year-olds (27.5%) and lowest in persons aged 85 years and over (11.5%). Of all B notifications with lineage determined, 77.1% were B/Victoria and 22.9% were B/Yamagata infections. Mismatches between the dominant B lineage in a season and the trivalent vaccine B lineage occurred in over one-third of seasons during the study years. In general, influenza B notifications peaked later than influenza A notifications. The proportion of circulating influenza B in Australia during 2001-2014 was slightly lower than the global average and was dominated by B/Victoria. Compared with influenza A, influenza B infection was more common among older children and young adults and less common in the very elderly. Influenza B lineage mismatch with the trivalent vaccine occurred about one-third of the time.

Title: Contamination-controlled high-throughput whole genome sequencing for influenza A viruses using the MiSeq sequencer.
Abstract: Accurate full-length genomic sequences are important for viral phylogenetic studies. We developed a targeted high-throughput whole genome sequencing (HT-WGS) method for influenza A viruses, which utilized an enzymatic cleavage-based approach, the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit, for library preparation. The entire library preparation workflow was adapted for the Sentosa SX101, a liquid handling platform, to automate this labor-intensive step. As the enzymatic cleavage-based approach generates low coverage reads at both ends of the cleaved products, we corrected this loss of sequencing coverage at the termini by introducing modified primers during the targeted amplification step to generate full-length influenza A sequences with even coverage across the whole genome. Another challenge of targeted HTS is the risk of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination during the library preparation step that results in the calling of false-positive minority variants. We included an in-run, negative system control to capture contamination reads that may be generated during the liquid handling procedures. The upper limits of 99.99% prediction intervals of the contamination rate were adopted as cut-off values of contamination reads. Here, 148 influenza A/H3N2 samples were sequenced using the HTS protocol and were compared against a Sanger-based sequencing method. Our data showed that the rate of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination was highly significant in HTS.

Title: A broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibody reveals ongoing capacity of haemagglutinin-specific memory B cells to evolve.
Abstract: Understanding the natural evolution and structural changes involved in broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) development holds great promise for improving the design of prophylactic influenza vaccines. Here we report an haemagglutinin (HA) stem-directed bnAb, 3I14, isolated from human memory B cells, that utilizes a heavy chain encoded by the IGHV3-30 germline gene. MAb 3I14 binds and neutralizes groups 1 and 2 influenza A viruses and protects mice from lethal challenge. Analysis of VH and VL germline back-mutants reveals binding to H3 and H1 but not H5, which supports the critical role of somatic hypermutation in broadening the bnAb response. Moreover, a single VLD94N mutation improves the affinity of 3I14 to H5 by nearly 10-fold. These data provide evidence that memory B cell evolution can expand the HA subtype specificity. Our results further suggest that establishing an optimized memory B cell pool should be an aim of 'universal' influenza vaccine strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antibody evolution and binding affinity to different influenza HA subtypes, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Isolation of H5N6, H7N9 and H9N2 avian influenza A viruses from air sampled at live poultry markets in China, 2014 and 2015.
Abstract: Zoonotic infections by avian influenza viruses occur at the human-poultry interface, but the modes of transmission have not been fully investigated. We assessed the potential for airborne and fomite transmission at live poultry markets in Guangzhou city and in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, during 2014 and 2015. Viral genome and infectious avian influenza A viruses of H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes were detected predominantly from particles larger or equal to 1 μm in diameter in the air sampled with cyclone-based bioaerosol samplers at the live poultry markets in Guangzhou. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses were ubiquitously isolated every month during the study period from air and environmental swabs, and different lineages of H9N2 virus were isolated from markets where chickens and minor land-based poultry were sold. The use of de-feathering devices increased the quantity of virus-laden airborne particles while market closure reduced the amount of such particles. The results highlight the possibility of airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses among poultry or from poultry to humans within such settings. This may explain epidemiological observations in which some patients with H7N9 infection reported being in markets but no direct contact with live poultry or poultry stalls.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection and isolation of viruses from air samples but does not analyze genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Human Alveolar Macrophages May Not Be Susceptible to Direct Infection by a Human Influenza Virus.
Abstract: The current studies were undertaken to determine the susceptibility of human alveolar macrophages (AMs) to influenza A virus (IAV) infection in comparison with autologous peripheral blood-derived monocytes-macrophages (PBMs). AMs and PBMs were exposed to IAV in vitro and examined for their ability to bind and internalize IAV, and synthesize viral proteins and RNA. PBMs but not AMs demonstrated binding and internalization of the virus, synthesizing viral proteins and RNA. Exposure of AMs in the presence of a sialidase inhibitor or anti-IAV antibody resulted in viral protein synthesis by the cells. Exposure of AMs to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled IAV in the presence of anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody also resulted in viral protein synthesis. Thus, human AMs are apparently not susceptible to direct infection by a human IAV but are likely to be infected indirectly in the setting of exposure in the presence of antibody that binds the challenging strain of IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines susceptibility of human alveolar macrophages to infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Droplet digital PCR: A novel method for detection of influenza virus defective interfering particles.
Abstract: Defective interfering (DI) particles are viruses that carry one or more large, internal deletions in the viral genome. These deletions occur commonly in RNA viruses due to polymerase error and yield incomplete genomes that typically lack essential coding regions. The presence of DI particles in a virus population can have a major impact on the efficiency of viral growth and is an important variable to consider in interpreting experimental results. Herein, we sought to develop a robust methodology for the quantification of DI particles within influenza A virus stocks. We took advantage of reverse transcription followed by droplet digital PCR (RT ddPCR), a highly sensitive and precise technology for determination of template concentrations without the use of a standard curve. Results were compared to those generated using standard RT qPCR. Both assays relied on the use of primers binding to terminal regions conserved in DI gene segments described to date, and internal primers targeting regions typically missing from DI particles. As it has been reported previously, we observed a lower coefficient of variation among technical replicates for ddPCR compared to qPCR. Results furthermore established RT ddPCR as a sensitive and quantitative method for detecting DI gene segments within influenza A virus stocks.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study develops a method to detect defective interfering particles but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Primer development to obtain complete coding sequence of HA and NA genes of influenza A/H3N2 virus.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute respiratory illness and has become a serious public health problem worldwide. The need to study the HA and NA genes in influenza A virus is essential since these genes frequently undergo mutations. This study describes the development of primer sets for RT-PCR to obtain complete coding sequence of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A/H3N2 virus from Indonesia. The primers were developed based on influenza A/H3N2 sequence worldwide from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and further tested using Indonesian influenza A/H3N2 archived samples of influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance from 2008 to 2009. An optimum RT-PCR condition was acquired for all HA and NA fragments designed to cover complete coding sequence of HA and NA genes. A total of 71 samples were successfully sequenced for complete coding sequence both of HA and NA genes out of 145 samples of influenza A/H3N2 tested. The developed primer sets were suitable for obtaining complete coding sequences of HA and NA genes of Indonesian samples from 2008 to 2009.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes primer development for sequencing HA and NA genes but does not link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evidence for the Introduction, Reassortment, and Persistence of Diverse Influenza A Viruses in Antarctica.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in Antarctica during 2013 revealed the prevalence of evolutionarily distinct influenza viruses of the H11N2 subtype in Adélie penguins. Here we present results from the continued surveillance of AIV on the Antarctic Peninsula during 2014 and 2015. In addition to the continued detection of H11 subtype viruses in a snowy sheathbill during 2014, we isolated a novel H5N5 subtype virus from a chinstrap penguin during 2015. Gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H11 virus detected in 2014 had a >99.1% nucleotide similarity to the H11N2 viruses isolated in 2013, suggesting the continued prevalence of this virus in Antarctica over multiple years. However, phylogenetic analysis of the H5N5 virus showed that the genome segments were recently introduced to the continent, except for the NP gene, which was similar to that in the endemic H11N2 viruses. Our analysis indicates geographically diverse origins for the H5N5 virus genes, with the majority of its genome segments derived from North American lineage viruses but the neuraminidase gene derived from a Eurasian lineage virus. In summary, we show the persistence of AIV lineages in Antarctica over multiple years, the recent introduction of gene segments from diverse regions, and reassortment between different AIV lineages in Antarctica, which together significantly increase our understanding of AIV ecology in this fragile and pristine environment. Analysis of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) detected in Antarctica reveals both the relatively recent introduction of an H5N5 AIV, predominantly of North American-like origin, and the persistence of an evolutionarily divergent H11 AIV. These data demonstrate that the flow of viruses from North America may be more common than initially thought and that, once introduced, these AIVs have the potential to be maintained within Antarctica. The future introduction of AIVs from North America into the Antarctic Peninsula is of particular concern given that highly pathogenic H5Nx viruses have recently been circulating among wild birds in parts of Canada and the Unites States following the movement of these viruses from Eurasia via migratory birds. The introduction of a highly pathogenic influenza virus in penguin colonies within Antarctica might have devastating consequences.

Title: Cell-Mediated Immunity Against Antigenically Drifted Influenza A(H3N2) Viruses in Children During a Vaccine Mismatch Season.
Abstract: Emergence of antigenically drifted influenza A(H3N2) viruses resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness in all age groups during the 2014-2015 influenza season. In children, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) elicited neutralizing antibodies (Abs) against drifted strains at significantly lower levels than against the vaccine strain. Little is known about the cross-reactivity of cell-mediated immunity against drifted strains in children. Children aged 3-17 years (n = 48) received IIV during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collected before (on day 0) and after (on days 7 and 21) vaccination were evaluated for induction of cross-reactive plasmablasts, memory B cells, and cytokine-secreting CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells against the vaccine and drifted A(H3N2) viruses by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay and flow cytometry. IIV increased frequencies of plasmablasts and memory B cells. The overall induction of the T-cell response was not significant. Both B-cell and T-cell responses showed significant cross-reactivity against A(H3N2) viruses. Age and preexisting immunity affected virus-specific plasmablast responses and fold-change of T-cell responses, respectively. The proportion of T-helper type 1-prone (ie, interferon γ- or tumor necrosis factor α-secreting) CD4(+) T cell responses also increased with age. In children aged 3-17 years, B- and T-cell responses following IIV receipt showed significant cross-reactivity against A(H3N2) viruses during a vaccine mismatch season.

Title: Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination.
Abstract: Antigen-specific B cells bifurcate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B cells (MBCs) after infection or vaccination. ASCs (plasmablasts) have been extensively studied in humans, but less is known about B cells that become activated but do not differentiate into plasmablasts. Here we have defined the phenotype and transcriptional program of a subset of antigen-specific B cells, which we have called 'activated B cells' (ABCs), that were distinct from ASCs and were committed to the MBC lineage. We detected ABCs in humans after infection with Ebola virus or influenza virus and also after vaccination. By simultaneously analyzing antigen-specific ASCs and ABCs in human blood after vaccination against influenza virus, we investigated the clonal overlap and extent of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the ASC (effector) and ABC (memory) lineages. Longitudinal tracking of vaccination-induced hemagglutinin (HA)-specific clones revealed no overall increase in SHM over time, which suggested that repeated annual immunization might have limitations in enhancing the quality of influenza-virus-specific antibody.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes antigen-specific B cell subsets after viral infection or vaccination but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Experimental Approaches to Study Genome Packaging of Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: The genome of influenza A viruses (IAV) consists of eight single-stranded negative sense viral RNAs (vRNAs) encapsidated into viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). It is now well established that genome packaging (i.e., the incorporation of a set of eight distinct vRNPs into budding viral particles), follows a specific pathway guided by segment-specific cis-acting packaging signals on each vRNA. However, the precise nature and function of the packaging signals, and the mechanisms underlying the assembly of vRNPs into sub-bundles in the cytoplasm and their selective packaging at the viral budding site, remain largely unknown. Here, we review the diverse and complementary methods currently being used to elucidate these aspects of the viral cycle. They range from conventional and competitive reverse genetics, single molecule imaging of vRNPs by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-resolution electron microscopy and tomography of budding viral particles, to solely in vitro approaches to investigate vRNA-vRNA interactions at the molecular level.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews experimental methods to study genome packaging of influenza A viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Novel Sequence-Based Mapping of Recently Emerging H5NX Influenza Viruses Reveals Pandemic Vaccine Candidates.
Abstract: Recently, an avian influenza virus, H5NX subclade 2.3.4.4, emerged and spread to North America. This subclade has frequently reassorted, leading to multiple novel viruses capable of human infection. Four cases of human infections, three leading to death, have already occurred. Existing vaccine strains do not protect against these new viruses, raising a need to identify new vaccine candidate strains. We have developed a novel sequence-based mapping (SBM) tool capable of visualizing complex protein sequence data sets using a single intuitive map. We applied SBM on the complete set of avian H5 viruses in order to better understand hemagglutinin protein variance amongst H5 viruses and identify any patterns associated with this variation. The analysis successfully identified the original reassortments that lead to the emergence of this new subclade of H5 viruses, as well as their known unusual ability to re-assort among neuraminidase subtypes. In addition, our analysis revealed distinct clusters of 2.3.4.4 variants that would not be covered by existing strains in the H5 vaccine stockpile. The results suggest that our method may be useful for pandemic candidate vaccine virus selection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on sequence-based mapping of hemagglutinin protein variance and vaccine candidate identification, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiological and Evolutionary Inference of the Transmission Network of the 2014 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N2 Outbreak in British Columbia, Canada.
Abstract: The first North American outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) involving a virus of Eurasian A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) lineage began in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada in late November 2014. A total of 11 commercial and 1 non-commercial (backyard) operations were infected before the outbreak was terminated. Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3 km radius of an infected premise(s) (IP). A complete epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with the movement of birds or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected as the source of infection for the remaining 4 IPs. Viral phylogenies, as determined by Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network. The phylogenetic clustering of concatenated viral genomes and the median-joining phylogenetic network of the viruses supported, for the most part, the transmission network that was inferred by the epidemiologic analysis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses viral phylogenies to validate epidemiological transmission networks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Sustained live poultry market surveillance contributes to early warnings for human infection with avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Sporadic human infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N6) virus have been reported in different provinces in China since April 2014. From June 2015 to January 2016, routine live poultry market (LPM) surveillance was conducted in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. H5N6 viruses were not detected until November 2015. The H5N6 virus-positive rate increased markedly beginning in December 2015, and viruses were detected in LPMs in all districts of the city. Coincidently, two human cases with histories of poultry exposure developed symptoms and were diagnosed as H5N6-positive in Shenzhen during late December 2015 and early January 2016. Similar viruses were identified in environmental samples collected in the LPMs and the patients. In contrast to previously reported H5N6 viruses, viruses with six internal genes derived from the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses were detected in the present study. The increased H5N6 virus-positive rate in the LPMs and the subsequent human infections demonstrated that sustained LPM surveillance for avian influenza viruses provides an early warning for human infections. Interventions, such as LPM closures, should be immediately implemented to reduce the risk of human infection with the H5N6 virus when the virus is widely detected during LPM surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports surveillance data and detection of viruses in markets and humans but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Discovery of cyclosporine A and its analogs as broad-spectrum anti-influenza drugs with a high in vitro genetic barrier of drug resistance.
Abstract: As the number of drug-resistant influenza viruses continues to increase, antivirals with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Among the two classes of FDA-approved antiviral drugs, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, are currently the only choice for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. Due to the antigenic drift and antigenic shift, it will only be a matter of time before influenza viruses become completely resistant to these NA inhibitors. In pursuing the next generation of antiviral drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to those of the NA inhibitors, we have identified a natural product, cyclosporine A (CsA) (1), as a desired drug candidate. In this study, we discovered that CsA (1) and its analogs have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple influenza A and B strains, including strains that are resistant to either NA or M2 inhibitors or both. Moreover, CsA (1) displays a high in vitro genetic barrier of drug resistance than oseltamivir carboxylate Mechanistic studies revealed that CsA (1) acts at the intermediate step of viral replication post viral fusion. Its antiviral mechanism is independent of inhibiting the isomerase activity of cyclophilin A (CypA), and CsA (1) has no effect on the viral polymerase activity The potent antiviral efficacy of CsA (1), coupled with the high in vitro genetic barrier of drug resistance and novel mechanism of action, renders CsA (1) a promising anti-influenza drug candidate for further development.

Title: Inhibition of influenza A virus matrix and nonstructural gene expression using RNA interference.
Abstract: Influenza antiviral drugs that use protein inhibitors can lose their efficacy as resistant strains emerge. As an alternative strategy, we investigated the use of small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) by characterizing three siRNAs (M747, M776 and M832) targeting the influenza matrix 2 gene and three (NS570, NS595 and NS615) targeting the nonstructural protein 1 and 2 genes. We also re-examined two previously reported siRNAs, M331 and M950, which target the matrix 1 and 2 genes. Treatment with M331-, M776-, M832-, and M950-siRNAs attenuated influenza titer. M776-siRNA treated cells had 29.8% less infectious virus than cells treated with the previously characterized siRNA, M950. NS570-, NS595- and NS615-siRNAs reduced nonstructural protein 1 and 2 expression and enhanced type I interferon expression by 50%. Combination siRNA treatment attenuated 20.9% more infectious virus than single siRNA treatment. Our results suggest a potential use for these siRNAs as an effective anti-influenza virus therapy.
Relevant: False

Title: Insights into the Usage of Nucleobase Triplets and Codon Context Pattern in Five Influenza A Virus Subtypes.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of negative polarity. Owing to the antigenic diversity and cross concrete shift, an immense number of novel strains have developed astronomically over the years. The present work deals with the codon utilization partialness among five different influenza A viruses isolated from human hosts. All the subtypes showed the homogeneous pattern of nucleotide utilization with a little variation in their utilization frequencies. A lower bias in codon utilization was observed in all the subtypes as reflected by higher magnitudes of an efficacious number of codons. Dinucleotide analysis showed very low CpG utilization and a high predilection of A/T-ending codons. The H5N1 subtype showed noticeable deviation from the rest. Codon pair context analysis showed remarkable depletion of NNC-GNN and NNT-ANN contexts. The findings alluded towards GC-compositional partialness playing a vital role, which is reflected in the consequential positive correlation between the GC contents at different codon positions. Untangling the codon utilization profile would significantly contribute to identifying novel drug targets that will pacify the search for antivirals against this virus.

Title: Molecular and antigenic characterization of the H3 hemagglutinin of H3N2 influenza A virus strains collected in the Czech Republic during the 2014/2015 epidemic season.
Abstract: The 2014/2015 influenza epidemic season was characterized by the predominance of the H3N2 subtype. The presented study investigated the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of the H3N2 strains collected in the Czech Republic from November 2014 to March 2015. Phylogenetic analysis of the representative H3 hemagglutinin sequences was performed and the glycosylation status and crucial antigenic mutations were compared relative to the 2014 and 2015 vaccine strains (A/Texas/50/2012 and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013) and visualized in the H3 crystal structure. The molecular data were further supplemented by hemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT) results on fifteen H3N2 2014/2015 strains by using the A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) and A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2) antisera. Our data on the Czech H3N2 viruses from the 2014/2015 epidemic season could supplement the reports of official authorities with data from a particular geographi-cal area.

Title: Hospital surveillance of influenza strains: a concordant image of viruses identified by the Swiss Sentinel system?
Abstract: The Swiss Sentinel system for influenza virus surveillance reports influenza-like illness in the community through a network of primary care practitioners, but the epidemiologic, demographic, and virological characterization may differ from that observed in hospitalized patients with influenza. To compare demographic and virological data from hospital influenza cases with Sentinel system data during the 2014-2015 season. We included 2623 in- and outpatients with a screening request for influenza A/B in a university teaching hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, and 933 participants from the Swiss Sentinel surveillance system and compared the demographic and virological data of the two populations, including the respective distribution of influenza subtypes, and conducted a phylogenetic comparison at the HA1 level of influenza viruses recovered in community and hospital cases. There were similar proportions of influenza strains recovered in the hospital and in the community (H3N2, 57.1% and 56.9%; H1N1pdm09, 15.5% and 14.2%; B, 27.4% and 28.8%, respectively). HA1 sequence analysis confirmed that all three strains were genetically similar between the two populations. During this particular season, influenza cases were detected earlier in the hospital than in the Sentinel system. Although an influenza surveillance system based on the community can predict the type of influenza strains that will be associated with hospitalizations, it fails to estimate the potential virulence of circulating strains. Further, the population characteristics in the community differ from those in hospitalized patients. This suggests that any national influenza surveillance system should include both community- and hospital-based surveys.

Title: Model-based clustering with certainty estimation: implication for clade assignment of influenza viruses.
Abstract: Clustering is a common technique used by molecular biologists to group homologous sequences and study evolution. There remain issues such as how to cluster molecular sequences accurately and in particular how to evaluate the certainty of clustering results. We presented a model-based clustering method to analyze molecular sequences, described a subset bootstrap scheme to evaluate a certainty of the clusters, and showed an intuitive way using 3D visualization to examine clusters. We applied the above approach to analyze influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. Nine clusters were estimated for high pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, which agree with previous findings. The certainty for a given sequence that can be correctly assigned to a cluster was all 1.0 whereas the certainty for a given cluster was also very high (0.92-1.0), with an overall clustering certainty of 0.95. For influenza A H7 viruses, ten HA clusters were estimated and the vast majority of sequences could be assigned to a cluster with a certainty of more than 0.99. The certainties for clusters, however, varied from 0.40 to 0.98; such certainty variation is likely attributed to the heterogeneity of sequence data in different clusters. In both cases, the certainty values estimated using the subset bootstrap method are all higher than those calculated based upon the standard bootstrap method, suggesting our bootstrap scheme is applicable for the estimation of clustering certainty. We formulated a clustering analysis approach with the estimation of certainties and 3D visualization of sequence data. We analysed 2 sets of influenza A HA sequences and the results indicate our approach was applicable for clustering analysis of influenza viral sequences.

Title: Vimentin plays a role in the release of the influenza A viral genome from endosomes.
Abstract: Influenza A virus exploits the subcellular transport machinery during the early stages of infection. Actin filaments and microtubules facilitate the trafficking of virus-containing endosomes towards the perinuclear region; however, the role of vimentin remains to be determined. In this study, we followed influenza A virus infection in vimentin-null cells and found that vimentin depletion severely reduced influenza viral RNA and protein expression, and production of infectious progeny virions. Furthermore, we show that in vimentin-null cells endosomal distribution and acidification were affected, and incoming influenza virions accumulated in late endosomes of these cells. We propose that this accumulation resulted from the impaired acidification of late endosomes in vimentin-null cells, which blocked the release of the viral genome from these organelles. These findings are the first to demonstrate that vimentin is critical for influenza viral infection as it facilitates endosomal trafficking and acidification, and mediates viral genome penetration into the cytoplasm to propagate the infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host cell protein vimentin's role in viral genome release and infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: NF90 is a novel influenza A virus NS1-interacting protein that antagonizes the inhibitory role of NS1 on PKR phosphorylation.
Abstract: NF90 is a novel host antiviral factor that regulates PKR activation and stress granule formation in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells, but the precise mechanisms by which it operates remain unclear. We identified NF90 as a novel interacting protein of IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). The interaction was dependent on the RNA-binding properties of NS1. NS1 associated with NF90 and PKR simultaneously; however, the interaction between NF90 and PKR was restricted by NS1. Knockdown of NF90 promoted inhibition of PKR phosphorylation induced by NS1, while coexpression of NF90 impeded reduction of PKR phosphorylation and stress granule formation triggered by NS1. In summary, NF90 exerts its antiviral activity by antagonizing the inhibitory role of NS1 on PKR phosphorylation.

Title: Chlamydia psittaci infection increases mortality of avian influenza virus H9N2 by suppressing host immune response.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (H9N2) and Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) are frequently isolated in chickens with respiratory disease. However, their roles in co-infection remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that C. psittaci enhances H9N2 infection through suppression of host immunity. Thus, 10-day-old SPF chickens were inoculated intra-tracheally with a high or low virulence C. psittaci strain, and were simultaneously vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Significant decreases in body weight, NDV antibodies and immune organ indices occurred in birds with the virulent C. psittaci infection, while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells increased significantly compared to that of the lower virulence strain. A second group of birds were inoculated with C. psittaci and H9N2 simultaneously (C. psittaci+H9N2), C. psittaci 3 days prior to H9N2 (C. psittaci/H9N2), or 3 days after H9N2 (H9N2/C. psittaci), C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. Survival rates were 65%, 80% and 90% in the C. psittaci/H9N2, C. psittaci+H9N2 and H9N2/C. psittaci groups, respectively and respiratory clinical signs, lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher pathogen loads were found in both C. psittaci/H9N2 and C. psittaci+H9N2 groups. Hence, virulent C. psittaci infection suppresses immune response by inhibiting humoral responses and altering Th1/Th2 balance, increasing mortality in H9N2 infected birds.

Title: Influenza virus RNA polymerase: insights into the mechanisms of viral RNA synthesis.
Abstract: The genomes of influenza viruses consist of multiple segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. Each of these segments is bound by the heterotrimeric viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and multiple copies of nucleoprotein, which form viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. It is in the context of these vRNPs that the viral RNA polymerase carries out transcription of viral genes and replication of the viral RNA genome. In this Review, we discuss our current knowledge of the structure of the influenza virus RNA polymerase, and insights that have been gained into the molecular mechanisms of viral transcription and replication, and their regulation by viral and host factors. Furthermore, we discuss how advances in our understanding of the structure and function of polymerases could help in identifying new antiviral targets.

Title: RIPK3 Is Largely Dispensable for RIG-I-Like Receptor- and Type I Interferon-Driven Transcriptional Responses to Influenza A Virus in Murine Fibroblasts.
Abstract: The kinase RIPK3 is a key regulator of cell death responses to a growing number of viral and microbial agents. We have found that influenza A virus (IAV)-mediated cell death is largely reliant on RIPK3 and that RIPK3-deficient mice are notably more susceptible to lethal infection by IAV than their wild-type counterparts. Recent studies demonstrate that RIPK3 also participates in regulating gene transcription programs during host pro-inflammatory and innate-immune responses, indicating that this kinase is not solely an inducer of cell death and that RIPK3-driven transcriptional responses may collaborate with cell death in promoting clearance of IAV. Here, we carried out DNA microarray analyses to determine the contribution of RIPK3 to the IAV-elicited host transcriptional response. We report that RIPK3 does not contribute significantly to the RLR-activated transcriptome or to the induction of type I IFN genes, although, interestingly, IFN-β production at a post-transcriptional step was modestly attenuated in IAV-infected ripk3-/- fibroblasts. Overall, RIPK3 regulated the expression of <5% of the IAV-induced transcriptome, and no genes were found to be obligate RIPK3 targets. IFN-β signaling was also found to be largely normal in the absence of RIPK3. Together, these results indicate that RIPK3 is not essential for the host antiviral transcriptional response to IAV in murine fibroblasts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host kinase RIPK3's role in host transcriptional responses to influenza infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Cyclophilin A protects mice against infection by influenza A virus.
Abstract: Our previous studies indicate that Cyclophilin A (CypA) impairs the replication of influenza A virus in vitro. To further evaluate the antiviral functions of CypA and explore its mechanism, transgenic mice with overexpression of CypA by two specific promoters with SPC (CypA-SPC) or CMV (CypA-CMV) were developed. After challenge with the A/WSN/33(H1N1) influenza virus, CypA-SPC and CypA-CMV transgenic mice displayed nearly 2.5- and 3.8-fold stronger disease resistance to virus infection, respectively, compared to wild-type animals. Virus replication, pathological lesions and inflammatory cytokines were substantially reduced in both lines of transgenic mice. In addition, after infection there was an upregulation of genes associated with cell migration, immune function, and organ development; and a downregulation of genes associated with the positive regulation of immune cells and apoptosis in the peritoneal macrophages of CypA-overexpressing transgenic mice (CypA+). These results indicate that CypA is a key modulator of influenza virus resistance in mice, and that CypA+ mice constitutes an important model to study the roles of CypA in the regulation of immune responses and infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host factor Cyclophilin A's role in antiviral defense and immune response modulation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Origins of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in swine in Mexico.
Abstract: Asia is considered an important source of influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics, owing to large, diverse viral reservoirs in poultry and swine. However, the zoonotic origins of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) remain unclear, due to conflicting evidence from swine and humans. There is strong evidence that the first human outbreak of pdmH1N1 occurred in Mexico in early 2009. However, no related swine viruses have been detected in Mexico or any part of the Americas, and to date the most closely related ancestor viruses were identified in Asian swine. Here, we use 58 new whole-genome sequences from IAVs collected in Mexican swine to establish that the swine virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic evolved in central Mexico. This finding highlights how the 2009 pandemic arose from a region not considered a pandemic risk, owing to an expansion of IAV diversity in swine resulting from long-distance live swine trade.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on phylogenetic and epidemiological origins of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Replication-Competent Influenza A Viruses Expressing Reporter Genes.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause annual seasonal human respiratory disease epidemics. In addition, IAV have been implicated in occasional pandemics with inordinate health and economic consequences. Studying IAV, in vitro or in vivo, requires the use of laborious secondary methodologies to identify virus-infected cells. To circumvent this requirement, replication-competent IAV expressing an easily traceable reporter protein can be used. Here we discuss the development and applications of recombinant replication-competent IAV harboring diverse fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter genes in different locations of the viral genome. These viruses have been employed for in vitro and in vivo studies, such as the screening of neutralizing antibodies or antiviral compounds, the identification of host factors involved in viral replication, cell tropism, the development of vaccines, or the assessment of viral infection dynamics. In summary, reporter-expressing, replicating-competent IAV represent a powerful tool for the study of IAV both in vitro and in vivo.

Title: The new pandemic influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus: is it really "new"?
Abstract: In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a pandemic alert concerning the spread of an influenza A (H1N1) virus that showed distinctive genetic characteristics vis-à-vis both seasonal influenza strains and vaccine strains. The main mutation occurred in the gene coding for hemagglutinin (HA). Mathematical models were developed to calculate the transmissibility of the virus; the results indicated a significant overlap with the transmissibility of previous pandemic strains and seasonal strains. The remarkable feature of A/(H1N1)pdm09, compared with seasonal strains, is its high fatality rate and its higher incidence among younger people. Data provided by the WHO on the number of deaths caused by A/(H1N1)pdm09 only include laboratory-confirmed cases. Some authors suggest that these data could underestimate the magnitude of the event, as laboratory confirmation is not obtained in all cases. It is important to bear in mind that the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus is still circulating in the population. It is therefore essential to maintain its epidemiological and virological surveillance.

Title: Prevalence and diversity of H9N2 avian influenza in chickens of Northern Vietnam, 2014.
Abstract: Despite their classification as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), A/H9N2 viruses cause significant losses in poultry in many countries throughout Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on detection of influenza H5 viruses, and there is limited understanding of influenza H9 epidemiology and transmission dynamics. We determined prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) of 7 northern Vietnamese provinces, using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real time RT-PCR revealed 1207/4900 (24.6%) of pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct<26. No influenza H7 was detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence was of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 whole genomes of A/H9N2, 2 of A/H5N6, and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98%, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of H9 viruses to northern Vietnam rather than in-situ transmission. Further investigations of H9 prevalence and diversity in other regions of Vietnam are warranted to assess H9 endemicity elsewhere in the country.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on prevalence and genetic diversity of H9N2 viruses in poultry, with phylogenetic analysis but no explicit genotype-phenotype functional linkage.

Title: Whole-genome analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in Uganda from 2009 to 2011.
Abstract: We report a whole-genome analysis of 19 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates from four Ugandan hospitals between 2009 and 2011. The isolates differed from the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 by three amino acid substitutions P100S, S220T, and I338V in the hemagglutinin and by two amino acid substitutions V106I and N248D in the neuraminidase proteins with consistent mutations in all gene segments distinguishing isolates from the 2009/2010 to 2010/2011 seasons. Phylogenetic analysis showed low genetic evolution, with genetic distances of 0%-1.3% and 0.1%-1.6% for HA and NA genes, respectively. The amino acid substitutions did not lead to antigenic differences from the reference strains.

Title: The Feat of Packaging Eight Unique Genome Segments.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) harbor a segmented RNA genome that is organized into eight distinct viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. Although a segmented genome may be a major advantage to adapt to new host environments, it comes at the cost of a highly sophisticated genome packaging mechanism. Newly synthesized vRNPs conquer the cellular endosomal recycling machinery to access the viral budding site at the plasma membrane. Genome packaging sequences unique to each RNA genome segment are thought to be key determinants ensuring the assembly and incorporation of eight distinct vRNPs into progeny viral particles. Recent studies using advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques suggest the formation of vRNP sub-bundles (comprising less than eight vRNPs) during their transport on recycling endosomes. The formation of such sub-bundles might be required for efficient packaging of a bundle of eight different genomes segments at the budding site, further highlighting the complexity of IAV genome packaging.

Title: Synthesis and Anti-Influenza A Virus Activity of 6'-amino-6'-deoxy-glucoglycerolipids Analogs.
Abstract: A series of aminoglucoglycerolipids derivatives had been synthesized, including 6'-acylamido-glucoglycerolipids 1a-1f and corresponding 2'-acylamido-glucoglycerolipids 2a-2c bearing different fatty acids, glucosyl diglycerides 3a-3e bearing different functional groups at C-6' and ether-linked glucoglycerolipids 4a-4c with double-tailed alkyl alcohol. The anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity was evaluated by the cytopathic effects (CPE) inhibition assay. The results indicated that the integral structure of the aminoglycoglycerolipid was essential for the inhibition of IAV in MDCK cells. Furthermore, oral administration of compound 1d was able to significantly improve survival and decrease pulmonary viral titers in IAV-infected mice, which suggested that compound 1d merited further investigation as a novel anti-IAV candidate in the future.

Title: In Vitro and In Vivo Attenuation of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) by Phosphoprotein Deletion.
Abstract: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is highly immunogenic and able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-ΔP, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-ΔP replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-ΔP in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-ΔP expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-ΔP incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication.

Reason: Studies attenuation of vesicular stomatitis virus by phosphoprotein deletion and expression of foreign antigens, not influenza virus genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza evolution and H3N2 vaccine effectiveness, with application to the 2014/2015 season.
Abstract: Influenza A is a serious disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality, and vaccines against the seasonal influenza disease are of variable effectiveness. In this article, we discuss the use of the pepitope method to predict the dominant influenza strain and the expected vaccine effectiveness in the coming flu season. We illustrate how the effectiveness of the 2014/2015 A/Texas/50/2012 [clade 3C.1] vaccine against the A/California/02/2014 [clade 3C.3a] strain that emerged in the population can be estimated via pepitope In addition, we show by a multidimensional scaling analysis of data collected through 2014, the emergence of a new A/New Mexico/11/2014-like cluster [clade 3C.2a] that is immunologically distinct from the A/California/02/2014-like strains.

Title: Influenza A Virus Challenge Models in Cynomolgus Macaques Using the Authentic Inhaled Aerosol and Intra-Nasal Routes of Infection.
Abstract: Non-human primates are the animals closest to humans for use in influenza A virus challenge studies, in terms of their phylogenetic relatedness, physiology and immune systems. Previous studies have shown that cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are permissive for infection with H1N1pdm influenza virus. These studies have typically used combined challenge routes, with the majority being intra-tracheal delivery, and high doses of virus (> 107 infectious units). This paper describes the outcome of novel challenge routes (inhaled aerosol, intra-nasal instillation) and low to moderate doses (103 to 106 plaque forming units) of H1N1pdm virus in cynomolgus macaques. Evidence of virus replication and sero-conversion were detected in all four challenge groups, although the disease was sub-clinical. Intra-nasal challenge led to an infection confined to the nasal cavity. A low dose (103 plaque forming units) did not lead to detectable infectious virus shedding, but a 1000-fold higher dose led to virus shedding in all intra-nasal challenged animals. In contrast, aerosol and intra-tracheal challenge routes led to infections throughout the respiratory tract, although shedding from the nasal cavity was less reproducible between animals compared to the high-dose intra-nasal challenge group. Intra-tracheal and aerosol challenges induced a transient lymphopaenia, similar to that observed in influenza-infected humans, and greater virus-specific cellular immune responses in the blood were observed in these groups in comparison to the intra-nasal challenge groups. Activation of lung macrophages and innate immune response genes was detected at days 5 to 7 post-challenge. The kinetics of infection, both virological and immunological, were broadly in line with human influenza A virus infections. These more authentic infection models will be valuable in the determination of anti-influenza efficacy of novel entities against less severe (and thus more common) influenza infections.

Title: Spring Migration Stopover Ecology of Avian Influenza Virus Shorebird Hosts at Delaware Bay.
Abstract: Although low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) are detected in shorebirds at Delaware Bay annually, little is known about affected species habitat preferences or the movement patterns that might influence virus transmission and spread. During the 5-wk spring migration stopover period during 2007-2008, we conducted a radiotelemetry study of often-infected ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres morinella; n = 60) and rarely infected sanderlings (Calidris alba; n = 20) to identify locations and habitats important to these species (during daytime and nighttime), determine the extent of overlap with other AIV reservoir species or poultry production areas, reveal possible movements of AIV around the Bay, and assess whether long-distance movement of AIV is likely after shorebird departure. Ruddy turnstones and sanderlings both fed on Bay beaches during the daytime. However, sanderlings used remote sandy points and islands during the nighttime while ruddy turnstones primarily used salt marsh harboring waterfowl and gull breeding colonies, suggesting that this environment supports AIV circulation. Shorebird locations were farther from agricultural land and poultry operations than were random locations, suggesting selection away from poultry. Further, there was no areal overlap between shorebird home ranges and poultry production areas. Only 37% (22/60) of ruddy turnstones crossed into Delaware from capture sites in New Jersey, suggesting partial site fidelity and AIV gene pool separation between the states. Ruddy turnstones departed en masse around June 1 when AIV prevalence was low or declining, suggesting that a limited number of birds could disperse AIV onto the breeding grounds. This study provides needed insight into AIV and migratory host ecology, and results can inform both domestic animal AIV prevention and shorebird conservation efforts.

Title: Prevalence and Diversity of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds in Guatemala, 2010-2013.
Abstract: Waterfowl species are known to harbor the greatest diversity of low pathogenicity influenza A virus (LPAIV) subtypes and are recognized as their main natural reservoir. In Guatemala there is evidence of circulation of LPAIV in wild ducks; however, the bird species contributing to viral diversity during the winter migration in Central America are unknown. In this study, samples obtained from 1250 hunter-killed birds from 22 different species were collected on the Pacific coast of Guatemala during three winter migration seasons between 2010 and 2013. Prevalence of LPAIV detected by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was 38.2%, 23.5%, and 24.7% in the 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 seasons, respectively. The highest virus prevalence was detected in the northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), followed by the blue-winged teal (Anas discors). The majority of positive samples and viral isolates were obtained from the blue-winged teal. Analysis of LPAIV prevalence over time in this species indicated a decreasing trend in monthly prevalence within a migration season. Sixty-eight viruses were isolated, and nine HA and seven NA subtypes were identified in 19 subtype combinations. In 2012-13 the most prevalent subtype was H14, a subtype identified for the first time in the Western Hemisphere in 2010. The results from this study represent the most detailed description available to date of LPAIV circulation in Central America.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on prevalence and diversity of LPAIV subtypes in wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The Use of Spatial and Spatiotemporal Modeling for Surveillance of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Poultry in the Middle East.
Abstract: Since 2005, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) has severely impacted the economy and public health in the Middle East (ME) with Egypt as the most affected country. Understanding the high-risk areas and spatiotemporal distribution of the H5N1 HPAIV in poultry is prerequisite for establishing risk-based surveillance activities at a regional level in the ME. Here, we aimed to predict the geographic range of H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks in poultry in the ME using a set of environmental variables and to investigate the spatiotemporal clustering of outbreaks in the region. Data from the ME for the period 2005-14 were analyzed using maximum entropy ecological niche modeling and the permutation model of the scan statistics. The predicted range of high-risk areas (P > 0.60) for H5N1 HPAIV in poultry included parts of the ME northeastern countries, whereas the Egyptian Nile delta and valley were estimated to be the most suitable locations for occurrence of H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks. The most important environmental predictor that contributed to risk for H5N1 HPAIV was the precipitation of the warmest quarter (47.2%), followed by the type of global livestock production system (18.1%). Most significant spatiotemporal clusters (P < 0.001) were detected in Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. Results suggest that more information related to poultry holding demographics is needed to further improve prediction of risk for H5N1 HPAIV in the ME, whereas the methodology presented here may be useful in guiding the design of surveillance programs and in identifying areas in which underreporting may have occurred.

Title: Influenza Activity - United States, 2015-16 Season and Composition of the 2016-17 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2015-16 influenza season (October 4, 2015-May 21, 2016) in the United States, influenza activity* was lower and peaked later compared with the previous three seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15). Activity remained low from October 2015 until late December 2015 and peaked in mid-March 2016. During the most recent 18 influenza seasons (including this season), only two other seasons have peaked in March (2011-12 and 2005-06). Overall influenza activity was moderate this season, with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI),(†) lower hospitalization rates, and a lower percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared with the preceding three seasons. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated overall, but influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly identified from October to early December, and influenza B viruses were more commonly identified from mid-April through mid-May. The majority of viruses characterized this season were antigenically similar to the reference viruses representing the recommended components of the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (1). This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2015-16 influenza season (October 4, 2015-May 21, 2016)(§) and reports the vaccine virus components recommended for the 2016-17 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Title: Influenza A viruses suppress cyclooxygenase-2 expression by affecting its mRNA stability.
Abstract: Infection with influenza A viruses (IAV) provokes activation of cellular defence mechanisms contributing to the innate immune and inflammatory response. In this process the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in the induction of prostaglandin-dependent inflammation. While it has been reported that COX-2 is induced upon IAV infection, in the present study we observed a down-regulation at later stages of infection suggesting a tight regulation of COX-2 by IAV. Our data indicate the pattern-recognition receptor RIG-I as mediator of the initial IAV-induced COX-2 synthesis. Nonetheless, during on-going IAV replication substantial suppression of COX-2 mRNA and protein synthesis could be detected, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA half-life. Interestingly, COX-2 mRNA stability was not only imbalanced by IAV replication but also by stimulation of cells with viral RNA. Our results reveal tristetraprolin (TTP), which is known to bind COX-2 mRNA and promote its rapid degradation, as regulator of COX-2 expression in IAV infection. During IAV replication and viral RNA accumulation TTP mRNA synthesis was induced, resulting in reduced COX-2 levels. Accordingly, the down-regulation of TTP resulted in increased COX-2 protein expression after IAV infection. These findings indicate a novel IAV-regulated cellular mechanism, contributing to the repression of host defence and therefore facilitating viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on influenza A virus effects on host COX-2 expression and mRNA stability, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Global update on the susceptibility of human influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors, 2014-2015.
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza (WHO CCs) tested 13,312 viruses collected by WHO recognized National Influenza Centres between May 2014 and May 2015 to determine 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) data for neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir. Ninety-four per cent of the viruses tested by the WHO CCs were from three WHO regions: Western Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Approximately 0.5% (n = 68) of viruses showed either highly reduced inhibition (HRI) or reduced inhibition (RI) (n = 56) against at least one of the four NAIs. Of the twelve viruses with HRI, six were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, three were A(H3N2) viruses and three were B/Yamagata-lineage viruses. The overall frequency of viruses with RI or HRI by the NAIs was lower than that observed in 2013-14 (1.9%), but similar to the 2012-13 period (0.6%). Based on the current analysis, the NAIs remain an appropriate choice for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections.

Title: The Role of Punctuated Evolution in the Pathogenicity of Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. Evolutionarily, all influenza viruses are zoonoses, arising in the animal reservoir and spilling over into the human population. Several times a century, one of these zoonotic events results in a new influenza virus lineage becoming established in humans and circulating for years or decades as an endemic strain. The worldwide pandemic that occurs shortly after the nascent virus becomes established can have a profound impact on morbidity and mortality. Because influenza viruses continually evolve and the illness they engender can vary considerably based on characteristics of the strain, the weather, other circulating or endemic pathogens, as well as the number of susceptible hosts, the impact of each season on human health is unpredictable. Over time, the general pattern is for pandemic strains to adapt and gradually take on characteristics of seasonal strains with lower virulence and a diminished synergism with bacterial pathogens. Study of this punctuated evolution yields a number of insights into the overall pathogenicity of influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses punctuated evolution and pathogenicity of influenza viruses in general terms without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: High antiviral effects of hibiscus tea extract on the H5 subtypes of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Viral neuraminidase inhibitors are widely used as synthetic anti-influenza drugs for the prevention and treatment of influenza. However, drug-resistant influenza A virus variants, including H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), have been reported. Therefore, the discovery of novel and effective antiviral agents is warranted. We screened the antiviral effects of 11 herbal tea extracts (hibiscus, black tea, tencha, rosehip tea, burdock tea, green tea, jasmine tea, ginger tea, lavender tea, rose tea and oak tea) against the H5N1 HPAIV in vitro. Among the tested extracts, only the hibiscus extract and its fractionated extract (frHibis) highly and rapidly reduced the titers of all H5 HPAIVs and low pathogenic AIVs (LPAIVs) used in the pre-treatment tests of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that were inoculated with a mixture of the virus and the extract. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that anti-H5 monoclonal antibodies could not bind to the deformed H5 virus particles pretreated with frHibis. In post-treatment tests of MDCK cells cultured in the presence of frHibis after infection with H5N1 HPAIV, the frHibis inhibited viral replication and the expression of viral antigens and genes. Among the plants tested, hibiscus showed the most prominent antiviral effects against both H5 HPAIV and LPAIV.

Title: A cross-immunization model for the extinction of old influenza strains.
Abstract: Given the frequent mutation of antigenic features, the constancy of genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza within a subtype is surprising. While the emergence of new strains and antigenic features is commonly attributed to selection by the human immune system, the mechanism that ensures the extinction of older strains remains controversial. To replicate this dynamics of replacement current models utilize mechanisms such as short-lived strain-transcending immunity, a direct competition for hosts, stochastic extinction or constrained antigenic evolution. Building on the idea of short-lived immunity we introduce a minimal model that exhibits the aforementioned dynamics of replacement. Our model relies only on competition due to an antigen specific immune-response in an unconstrained antigenic space. Furthermore the model explains the size of typical influenza epidemics as well as the tendency that new epidemics are associated with mutations of old antigens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a theoretical model of influenza strain extinction dynamics without explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Multiple gene mutations identified in patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus.
Abstract: Influenza A (H7N9) virus induced high mortality since 2013. It is important to elucidate the potential genetic variations that contribute to virus infection susceptibilities. In order to identify genetic mutations that might increase host susceptibility to infection, we performed exon sequencing and validated the SNPS by Sanger sequencing on 18 H7N9 patients. Blood samples were collected from 18 confirmed H7N9 patients. The genomic DNA was captured with the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit, sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2000, and the resulting data processed and annotated with Genome analysis Tool. SNPs were verified by independent Sanger sequencing. The DAVID database and the DAPPLE database were used to do bioinformatics analysis. Through exon sequencing and Sanger sequencing, we identified 21 genes that were highly associated with H7N9 influenza infection. Protein-protein interaction analysis showed that direct interactions among genetic products were significantly higher than expected (p = 0.004), and DAVID analysis confirmed the defense-related functions of these genes. Gene mutation profiles of survived and non-survived patients were similar, suggesting some of genes identified in this study may be associated with H7N9 influenza susceptibility.

Reason: The paper focuses on host genetic mutations associated with susceptibility to H7N9 infection, not on viral genotypes or their phenotypic effects.

Title: Individual Correlates of Infectivity of Influenza A Virus Infections in Households.
Abstract: Identifying individual correlates of infectivity of influenza virus is important for disease control and prevention. Viral shedding is used as a proxy measure of infectivity in many studies. However, the evidence for this is limited. In a detailed study of influenza virus transmission within households in 2008-12, we recruited index cases with confirmed influenza infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7-10 days to identify secondary infections. We used individual-based hazard models to characterize the relationship between individual viral shedding and individual infectivity. We analyzed 386 households with 1147 household contacts. Index cases were separated into 3 groups according to their estimated level of viral shedding at symptom onset. We did not find a statistically significant association of virus shedding with transmission. Index cases in medium and higher viral shedding groups were estimated to have 21% (95% CI: -29%, 113%) and 44% (CI: -16%, 167%) higher infectivity, compared with those in the lower viral shedding group. Individual viral load measured by RT-PCR in the nose and throat was at most weakly correlated with individual infectivity in households. Other correlates of infectivity should be examined in future studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines correlation between viral shedding and infectivity but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Co-circulation of H5N6, H3N2, H3N8, and Emergence of Novel Reassortant H3N6 in a Local Community in Hunan Province in China.
Abstract: Multiple infections of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in poultry or wild birds contribute to the continued evolution of H5 subtype viruses in nature and provide potential recombination of AIVs of different origins. In this study, we carried out surveillance of AIVs in ducks, geese and the environment of a community in Hunan province, China, from 2014-2015. We isolated multiple co-circulated AIVs including H3N2, H3N8, and H5N6, and, most importantly, a novel reassortant: H3N6. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that H3N6 is highly likely derived from H5N6, which has recently been shown to have zoonotic potential with human infections. Studies with mammalian cell lines and a mouse model indicate that four selected AIVs of duck or goose origin can infect MDCK and A549 cells but have low pathogenicity in mice. We propose that a potential co-circulation of multiple subtypes including H5N6 in local area may result in the production of novel subtypes such as H3N6 by gene reassortment.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports co-circulation and reassortment of influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Exploiting Genetic Interference for Antiviral Therapy.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving viruses are a major threat to human health. Such viruses are often highly pathogenic (e.g., influenza virus, HIV, Ebola virus) and routinely circumvent therapeutic intervention through mutational escape. Error-prone genome replication generates heterogeneous viral populations that rapidly adapt to new selection pressures, leading to resistance that emerges with treatment. However, population heterogeneity bears a cost: when multiple viral variants replicate within a cell, they can potentially interfere with each other, lowering viral fitness. This genetic interference can be exploited for antiviral strategies, either by taking advantage of a virus's inherent genetic diversity or through generating de novo interference by engineering a competing genome. Here, we discuss two such antiviral strategies, dominant drug targeting and therapeutic interfering particles. Both strategies harness the power of genetic interference to surmount two particularly vexing obstacles-the evolution of drug resistance and targeting therapy to high-risk populations-both of which impede treatment in resource-poor settings.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing antiviral strategies exploiting genetic interference, not linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus intracellular replication dynamics, release kinetics, and particle morphology during propagation in MDCK cells.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens and can cause severe disease. The best protection against influenza is provided by annual vaccination. These vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or using continuous animal cell lines. The latter processes are more flexible and scalable to meet the growing global demand. However, virus production in cell cultures is more expensive. Hence, further research is needed to make these processes more cost-effective and robust. We studied influenza virus replication dynamics to identify factors that limit the virus yield in adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The cell cycle stage of MDCK cells had no impact during early infection. Yet, our results showed that the influenza virus RNA synthesis levels out already 4 h post infection at a time when viral genome segments are exported from the nucleus. Nevertheless, virus release occurred at a constant rate in the following 16 h. Thereafter, the production of infectious viruses dramatically decreased, but cells continued to produce particles contributing to the hemagglutination (HA) titer. The majority of these particles from the late phase of infection were deformed or broken virus particles as well as large membranous structures decorated with viral surface proteins. These changes in particle characteristics and morphology need to be considered for the optimization of influenza virus production and vaccine purification steps. Moreover, our data suggest that in order to achieve higher cell-specific yields, a prolonged phase of viral RNA synthesis and/or a more efficient release of influenza virus particles is required.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies influenza virus replication dynamics and particle morphology but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Forsythoside A Controls Influenza A Virus Infection and Improves the Prognosis by Inhibiting Virus Replication in Mice.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to observe the effects of forsythoside A on controlling influenza A virus (IAV) infection and improving the prognosis of IAV infection. Forty-eight SPF C57BL/6j mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: Group A: normal control group (normal con); Group B: IAV control group (V con); Group C: IAV+ oseltamivir treatment group (V oseltamivir; 0.78 mg/mL, 0.2 mL/mouse/day); Group D: IAV+ forsythoside A treatment group (V FTA; 2 μg/mL, 0.2 mL/mouse/day). Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure mRNA expression of the TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK4 and NF-κB p65 mRNA in TLR7 signaling pathway and the virus replication level in lung. Western blot was used to measure TLR7, MyD88 and NF-κB p65 protein. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of the T cell subsets Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg. The body weight began to decrease after IAV infection, while FTA and oseltamivir could reduce the rate of body weight loss. The pathological damages in the FTA and oseltamivir group were less serious. TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK4 and NF-κB p65 mRNA were up-regulated after virus infection (p < 0.01) while down-regulated after oseltamivir and FTA treatment (p < 0.01). The results of TLR7, MyD88 and NF-κB p65 protein consisted with correlative mRNA. Flow cytometry showed the Th1/Th2 differentiated towards Th2, and the Th17/Treg cells differentiated towards Treg after FTA treatment. Our study suggests forsythoside A can control influenza A virus infection and improve the prognosis of IAV infection by inhibiting influenza A virus replication.

Title: Pre-immune state induced by chicken interferon gamma inhibits the replication of H1N1 human and H9N2 avian influenza viruses in chicken embryo fibroblasts.
Abstract: Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), an immunoregulatory cytokine, is known to control many microbial infections. In a previous study, chicken interferon gamma (chIFN-γ) was found to be up-regulated following avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in specific pathogen-free chickens. We aimed to investigate whether the pre-immune state induced by chIFN-γ could generate an antiviral response against influenza virus. We generated a chIFN-γ-expressing plasmid and transfected it into chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and then infected the cells with human origin H1N1 or avian origin H9N2 influenza viruses. Viral titers of culture medium were evaluated in MDCK cell and the viral RNA and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were then quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase. To further evaluate the role of the antiviral effect of chIFN-γ by using a backward approach, synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting chIFN-γ were used to suppress chIFN-γ. The chIFN-γ-stimulated CEFs inhibited the replication of viral RNA (vRNA) and showed a mild decrease in the infectious virus load released in the culture medium. Compared to the mock-transfected control, the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes were up-regulated in the cells expressing chIFN-γ. After treatment with the siRNA, we detected a higher expression of viral genes than that observed in the mock-transfected control. Our results suggest that apart from the important role played by chIFN-γ in the antiviral state generated against influenza virus infection, the pre-immune state induced by chIFN-γ can be helpful in mitigating the propagation of influenza virus.

Title: The avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus that recently emerged in the United States has limited replication in swine.
Abstract: Equine-origin H3N8 has circulated in dogs in the United States since 1999. A genetically and antigenically distinct avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza was detected in March of 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. Subsequent outbreaks were reported with over 1000 dogs in the Midwest affected followed by 23 additional states with detections within 5 months. The potential for canine-to-swine transmission was unknown. Experimental infection in pigs showed this virus does not replicate efficiently in swine.

Title: Neutralizing inhibitors in the airways of naïve ferrets do not play a major role in modulating the virulence of H3 subtype influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Many insights regarding the pathogenesis of human influenza A virus (IAV) infections have come from studies in mice and ferrets. Surfactant protein (SP)-D is the major neutralizing inhibitor of IAV in mouse airway fluids and SP-D-resistant IAV mutants show enhanced virus replication and virulence in mice. Herein, we demonstrate that sialylated glycoproteins, rather than SP-D, represent the major neutralizing inhibitors against H3 subtype viruses in airway fluids from naïve ferrets. Moreover, while resistance to neutralizing inhibitors is a critical factor in modulating virus replication and disease in the mouse model, it does not appear to be so in the ferret model, as H3 mutants resistant to either SP-D or sialylated glycoproteins in ferret airway fluids did not show enhanced virulence in ferrets. These data have important implications for our understanding of pathogenesis and immunity to human IAV infections in these two widely used animal models of infection.

Title: Enhancement of Virus Replication in An Influenza A Virus NS1-Expresssing 293 Cell Line.
Abstract: The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus, which is absent from the viral particle, but highly expressed in infected cells, strongly antagonizes the interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response. We engineered an NS1-expressing 293 (293-NS1) cell line with no response to IFN stimulation. Compared with the parental 293 cells, the IFN-nonresponsive 293-NS1 cells improved the growth capacity of various viruses, but the introduction of NS1 barely enhanced the propagation of Tahyna virus, a negative-strand RNA virus. In particular, fastidious enteric adenovirus that replicates poorly in 293 cells may grow more efficiently in 293-NS1 cells; thus, IFN-nonresponsive 293-NS1 cells might be of great value in diagnostic laboratories for the cultivation and isolation of human enteric adenoviruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a cell line expressing NS1 protein to enhance virus replication but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: In vitro modeling of the interaction between human epithelial cells and lymphocytes upon influenza infection.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are a continuous threat to humans because of their ability to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts. Data from murine studies, along with limited human data, suggest that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize conserved epitopes of structural influenza proteins are the main mediators of influenza virus clearance. Additionally, the fact that many CTLs recognize epitopes shared between different influenza strains offers the potential for broad cross-strain immunity. However, the mechanisms of cellular immunity against influenza viruses are poorly defined in humans, where the CTL response has been hard to measure and interpret. We developed a novel CTL assay that utilizes fully differentiated nasal human epithelial cells taken from volunteers as permissive targets for autologous peripheral blood-derived influenza virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This in vitro system of human lymphocyte-epithelial cell co-cultures can be considered as the closest approximation to events in vivo and can be employed for studying the interactions between the pathogen and human host. Modeling of the natural interaction process between the primary cell type that supports the productive replication of influenza and immune cells may allow us to put in perspective CTLs as a correlate of immunity to influenza in humans.

Title: RNA-Free and Ribonucleoprotein-Associated Influenza Virus Polymerases Directly Bind the Serine-5-Phosphorylated Carboxyl-Terminal Domain of Host RNA Polymerase II.
Abstract: Influenza viruses subvert the transcriptional machinery of their hosts to synthesize their own viral mRNA. Ongoing transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is required for viral mRNA synthesis. By a process known as cap snatching, the virus steals short 5' capped RNA fragments from host capped RNAs and uses them to prime viral transcription. An interaction between the influenza A virus RNA polymerase and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of Pol II has been established, but the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. We show here that the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex binds to the CTD of transcriptionally engaged Pol II. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the viral polymerase binds directly to the serine-5-phosphorylated form of the Pol II CTD, both in the presence and in the absence of viral RNA, and show that this interaction is conserved in evolutionarily distant influenza viruses. We propose a model in which direct binding of the viral RNA polymerase in the context of vRNPs to Pol II early in infection facilitates cap snatching, while we suggest that binding of free viral polymerase to Pol II late in infection may trigger Pol II degradation. Influenza viruses cause yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics that pose a threat to human health, as well as represent a large economic burden to health care systems globally. Existing vaccines are not always effective, as they may not exactly match the circulating viruses. Furthermore, there are a limited number of antivirals available, and development of resistance to these is a concern. New measures to combat influenza are needed, but before they can be developed, it is necessary to better understand the molecular interactions between influenza viruses and their host cells. By providing further insights into the molecular details of how influenza viruses hijack the host transcriptional machinery, we aim to uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals.

Reason: The paper focuses on molecular interactions between influenza virus polymerases and host RNA polymerase II, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Chemical Genomics Identifies the PERK-Mediated Unfolded Protein Stress Response as a Cellular Target for Influenza Virus Inhibition.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses generate annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory disease with important consequences for human health and the economy. Therefore, a large effort has been devoted to the development of new anti-influenza virus drugs directed to viral targets, as well as to the identification of cellular targets amenable to anti-influenza virus therapy. Here we have addressed the identification of such potential cellular targets by screening collections of drugs approved for human use. We reasoned that screening with a green fluorescent protein-based recombinant replicon system would identify cellular targets involved in virus transcription/replication and/or gene expression and hence address an early stage of virus infection. By using such a strategy, we identified Montelukast (MK) as an inhibitor of virus multiplication. MK inhibited virus gene expression but did not alter viral RNA synthesis in vitro or viral RNA accumulation in vivo The low selectivity index of MK prevented its use as an antiviral, but it was sufficient to identify a new cellular pathway suitable for anti-influenza virus intervention. By deep sequencing of RNA isolated from mock- and virus-infected human cells, treated with MK or left untreated, we showed that it stimulates the PERK-mediated unfolded protein stress response. The phosphorylation of PERK was partly inhibited in virus-infected cells but stimulated in MK-treated cells. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PERK phosphorylation led to increased viral gene expression, while inhibition of PERK phosphatase reduced viral protein synthesis. These results suggest the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response as a potential cellular target to modulate influenza virus infection. Influenza A viruses are responsible for annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with important consequences for human health and the economy. The unfolded protein response is a defense mechanism fired by cells when the demand of protein synthesis and folding is excessive, for instance, during an acute virus infection. In this report, we show that influenza virus downregulates the unfolded protein response mediated by the PERK sensor, while Montelukast, a drug used to treat asthma in humans, specifically stimulated this response and downregulated viral protein synthesis and multiplication. Accordingly, we show that PERK phosphorylation was reduced in virus-infected cells and increased in cells treated with Montelukast. Hence, our studies suggest that modulation of the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response is a target for influenza virus inhibition.

Reason: The study investigates cellular pathways targeted by influenza virus inhibition and host responses, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Shutoff of Host Gene Expression in Influenza A Virus and Herpesviruses: Similar Mechanisms and Common Themes.
Abstract: The ability to shut off host gene expression is a shared feature of many viral infections, and it is thought to promote viral replication by freeing host cell machinery and blocking immune responses. Despite the molecular differences between viruses, an emerging theme in the study of host shutoff is that divergent viruses use similar mechanisms to enact host shutoff. Moreover, even viruses that encode few proteins often have multiple mechanisms to affect host gene expression, and we are only starting to understand how these mechanisms are integrated. In this review we discuss the multiplicity of host shutoff mechanisms used by the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus and members of the alpha- and gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies. We highlight the surprising similarities in their mechanisms of host shutoff and discuss how the different mechanisms they use may play a coordinated role in gene regulation.

Title: Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in primary care in the United Kingdom: 2015/16 mid-season results.
Abstract: In 2015/16, the influenza season in the United Kingdom was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation. Virus characterisation indicated the emergence of genetic clusters, with the majority antigenically similar to the current influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain. Mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates show an adjusted VE of 41.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-64.7) against influenza-confirmed primary care consultations and of 49.1% (95% CI: 9.3-71.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These estimates show levels of protection similar to the 2010/11 season, when this strain was first used in the seasonal vaccine.

Title: A novel antibody discovery platform identifies anti-influenza A broadly neutralizing antibodies from human memory B cells.
Abstract: Monoclonal antibody isolation directly from circulating human B cells is a powerful tool to delineate humoral responses to pathological conditions and discover antibody therapeutics. We have developed a platform aimed at improving the efficiencies of B cell selection and V gene recovery. Here, memory B cells are activated and amplified using Epstein-Barr virus infection, co-cultured with CHO-muCD40L cells, and then assessed by functional screenings. An in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) approach was used to analyze variable (V) genes recovered from each B cell sample and identify the relevant heavy/light chain pair(s). We achieved efficient amplification and activation of memory B cells, and eliminated the need to: 1) seed B cells at clonal level (≤1 cell/well) or perform limited dilution cloning; 2) immortalize B cells; or 3) assemble V genes into an IgG expression vector to confirm the relevant heavy/light chain pairing. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting a conserved epitope on influenza A hemagglutinin were successfully isolated from a healthy donor. In-depth analysis of the isolated antibodies suggested their potential uses as anti-influenza A antibody therapeutics and uncovered a distinct affinity maturation pathway. Importantly, our results showed that cognate heavy/light chain pairings contributed to both the expression level and binding abilities of our newly isolated VH1-69 family, influenza A neutralizing antibodies, contrasting with previous observations that light chains do not significantly contribute to the function of this group of antibodies. Our results further suggest the potential use of the IVTT as a powerful antibody developability assessment tool.

Title: Antigenic Drift of A/H3N2/Virus and Circulation of Influenza-Like Viruses During the 2014/2015 Influenza Season in Poland.
Abstract: Morbidity rates of influenza could be greatly reduced due to vaccination. However, the virus is able to evolve through genetic mutations, which is why vaccines with updated composition are necessary every season. Their effectiveness depends on whether there is a good antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. In Poland, the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic started in week 5 (January/February) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (April) of 2015. The influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influence-like illness at week 10/2015 (March). During that season, antigenic drift of influenza virus A/H3N2/ occurred causing higher rates of A/H3N2/ infections. Among the 2416 tested specimens, 22.6 % of influenza cases were positive for A/H3N2/, while A/H1N1/pdm09 constituted 14.6 % cases. Influenza A viruses were detected in co-circulation with influenza B viruses; the latter amounted to 34.1 % of all influenza detections. Other detected causes of influenza-like illness consisted of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), being predominant, and, sporadically, human coronavirus, parainfluenza 1-3, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. Despite low vaccine effectiveness of solely one component, A/H3N2/, the vaccine could mitigate or shorten the length of influenza infection and reduce the number of severe outcomes and mortality. Thus, vaccination against influenza remains the most effective way to prevent illness and possibly fatal outcomes.

Title: A novel small-molecule inhibitor of influenza A virus acts by suppressing PA endonuclease activity of the viral polymerase.
Abstract: The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus comprises conserved and independently-folded subdomains with defined functionalities. The N-terminal domain of the PA subunit (PA(N)) harbors the endonuclease function so that it can serve as a desired target for drug discovery. To identify a class of anti-influenza inhibitors that impedes PA(N) endonuclease activity, a screening approach that integrated the fluorescence resonance energy transfer based endonuclease inhibitory assay with the DNA gel-based endonuclease inhibitory assay was conducted, followed by the evaluation of antiviral efficacies and potential cytotoxicity of the primary hits in vitro and in vivo. A small-molecule compound ANA-0 was identified as a potent inhibitor against the replication of multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2, in cell cultures. Combinational treatment of zanamivir and ANA-0 exerted synergistic anti-influenza effect in vitro. Intranasal administration of ANA-0 protected mice from lethal challenge and reduced lung viral loads in H1N1 virus infected BALB/c mice. In summary, ANA-0 shows potential to be developed to novel anti-influenza agents.

Title: A "building block" approach to the new influenza A virus entry inhibitors with reduced cellular toxicities.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a severe worldwide threat to public health and economic development that results in the emergence of drug-resistant or highly virulent strains. Therefore, it is imperative to develop potent anti-IAV drugs with different modes of action to currently available drugs. Herein, we show a new class of antiviral peptides generated by conjugating two known short antiviral peptides: part-1 (named Jp with the sequence of ARLPR) and part-2 (named Hp with the sequence of KKWK). The new peptides were thus created by hybridization of these two domains at C- and N- termini, respectively. The anti-IAV screening results identified that C20-Jp-Hp was the most potent peptide with IC50 value of 0.53 μM against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) strain. Interestingly, these new peptides display lower toxicities toward mammalian cells and higher therapeutic indices than their prototypes. In addition, the mechanism of action of C20-Jp-Hp was extensively investigated.

Title: Tissue factor deficiency increases alveolar hemorrhage and death in influenza A virus-infected mice.
Abstract: Essentials H1N1 Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a hemostatic challenge for the lung. Tissue factor (TF) on lung epithelial cells maintains lung hemostasis after IAV infection. Reduced TF-dependent activation of coagulation leads to alveolar hemorrhage. Anticoagulation might increase the risk for hemorrhages into the lung during severe IAV infection. Background Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a common respiratory tract infection that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objective To investigate the effect of genetic deficiency of tissue factor (TF) in a mouse model of IAV infection. Methods Wild-type mice, low-TF (LTF) mice and mice with the TF gene deleted in different cell types were infected with a mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 strain of IAV. TF expression was measured in the lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to measure extracellular vesicle TF, activation of coagulation, alveolar hemorrhage, and inflammation. Results IAV infection of wild-type mice increased lung TF expression, activation of coagulation and inflammation in BALF, but also led to alveolar hemorrhage. LTF mice and mice with selective deficiency of TF in lung epithelial cells had low basal levels of TF and failed to increase TF expression after infection; these two strains of mice had more alveolar hemorrhage and death than controls. In contrast, deletion of TF in either myeloid cells or endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells did not increase alveolar hemorrhage or death after IAV infection. These results indicate that TF expression in the lung, particularly in epithelial cells, is required to maintain alveolar hemostasis after IAV infection. Conclusion Our study indicates that TF-dependent activation of coagulation is required to limit alveolar hemorrhage and death after IAV infection.

Title: Quantifying and Mitigating the Effect of Preferential Sampling on Phylodynamic Inference.
Abstract: Phylodynamics seeks to estimate effective population size fluctuations from molecular sequences of individuals sampled from a population of interest. One way to accomplish this task formulates an observed sequence data likelihood exploiting a coalescent model for the sampled individuals' genealogy and then integrating over all possible genealogies via Monte Carlo or, less efficiently, by conditioning on one genealogy estimated from the sequence data. However, when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision. Finally, we compare the performance of the currently used phylodynamic methods with our proposed model through clinically-relevant, seasonal human influenza examples.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylodynamic inference methods and sampling bias, not on explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Fatal Encephalopathy Associated with Influenza in a Health Care Professional.
Abstract: A 41-year-old nurse was referred to our hospital with a fever and disturbed consciousness. She tested positive for influenza antigen. CT and MRI findings revealed low density and intensity areas in the right occipital and lateral lobes with remarkable brain edema, which led to a diagnosis of influenza encephalopathy. Influenza A antibodies in the serum were below the detection limit despite the patient receiving previous vaccination three months earlier. A PCR analysis revealed that the influenza HA gene was classified into clade 3C.2a, subclass AH3N2. The present case indicates the potential development of encephalopathy in adults under certain conditions.

Title: Protein-lipid interactions critical to replication of the influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) assembles on the plasma membrane where viral proteins localize to form a bud encompassing the viral genome, which ultimately pinches off to give rise to newly formed infectious virions. Upon entry, the virus faces the opposite task-fusion with the endosomal membrane and disassembly to deliver the viral genome to the cytoplasm. There are at least four influenza proteins-hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix 1 protein (M1), and the M2 ion channel-that are known to directly interact with the cellular membrane and modify membrane curvature in order to both assemble and disassemble membrane-enveloped virions. Here, we summarize and discuss current knowledge of the interactions of lipids and membrane proteins involved in the IAV replication cycle.

Title: Within-Host Models of High and Low Pathogenic Influenza Virus Infections: The Role of Macrophages.
Abstract: The World Health Organization identifies influenza as a major public health problem. While the strains commonly circulating in humans usually do not cause severe pathogenicity in healthy adults, some strains that have infected humans, such as H5N1, can cause high morbidity and mortality. Based on the severity of the disease, influenza viruses are sometimes categorized as either being highly pathogenic (HP) or having low pathogenicity (LP). The reasons why some strains are LP and others HP are not fully understood. While there are likely multiple mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the immune response that determine LP versus HP outcomes, we focus here on one component, namely macrophages (MP). There is some evidence that MP may both help fight the infection and become productively infected with HP influenza viruses. We developed mathematical models for influenza infections which explicitly included the dynamics and action of MP. We fit these models to viral load and macrophage count data from experimental infections of mice with LP and HP strains. Our results suggest that MP may not only help fight an influenza infection but may contribute to virus production in infections with HP viruses. We also explored the impact of combination therapies with antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs on HP infections. Our study suggests a possible mechanism of MP in determining HP versus LP outcomes, and how different interventions might affect infection dynamics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on within-host models of influenza infection and macrophage roles but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A Virus Dysregulates Host Histone Deacetylase 1 That Inhibits Viral Infection in Lung Epithelial Cells.
Abstract: Viruses dysregulate the host factors that inhibit virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that human enzyme, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a new class of host factor that inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) infection, and IAV dysregulates HDAC1 to efficiently replicate in epithelial cells. A time-dependent decrease in HDAC1 polypeptide level was observed in IAV-infected cells, reducing to <50% by 24 h of infection. A further depletion (97%) of HDAC1 expression by RNA interference increased the IAV growth kinetics, increasing it by >3-fold by 24 h and by >6-fold by 48 h of infection. Conversely, overexpression of HDAC1 decreased the IAV infection by >2-fold. Likewise, a time-dependent decrease in HDAC1 activity, albeit with slightly different kinetics to HDAC1 polypeptide reduction, was observed in infected cells. Nevertheless, a further inhibition of deacetylase activity increased IAV infection in a dose-dependent manner. HDAC1 is an important host deacetylase and, in addition to its role as a transcription repressor, HDAC1 has been lately described as a coactivator of type I interferon response. Consistent with this property, we found that inhibition of deacetylase activity either decreased or abolished the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription I (STAT1) and expression of interferon-stimulated genes, IFITM3, ISG15, and viperin in IAV-infected cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of HDAC1 expression in infected cells decreased viperin expression by 58% and, conversely, the overexpression of HDAC1 increased it by 55%, indicating that HDAC1 is a component of IAV-induced host type I interferon antiviral response. Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to significantly impact global public health by causing regular seasonal epidemics, occasional pandemics, and zoonotic outbreaks. IAV is among the successful human viral pathogens that has evolved various strategies to evade host defenses, prevent the development of a universal vaccine, and acquire antiviral drug resistance. A comprehensive knowledge of IAV-host interactions is needed to develop a novel and alternative anti-IAV strategy. Host produces a variety of factors that are able to fight IAV infection by employing various mechanisms. However, the full repertoire of anti-IAV host factors and their antiviral mechanisms has yet to be identified. We have identified here a new host factor, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that inhibits IAV infection. We demonstrate that HDAC1 is a component of host innate antiviral response against IAV, and IAV undermines HDAC1 to limit its role in antiviral response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host factor HDAC1's role in inhibiting influenza infection and virus-host interactions, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity--United States, October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016.
Abstract: From October through mid-December 2015, influenza activity remained low in most regions of the United States. Activity began to increase in late December 2015 and continued to increase slowly through early February 2016. Influenza A viruses have been most frequently identified, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating during October until early December, and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating from mid-December until early February. Most of the influenza viruses characterized during that time are antigenically similar to vaccine virus strains recommended for inclusion in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016, and updates the previous summary (1).

Title: The C-Terminal Tail of TRIM56 Dictates Antiviral Restriction of Influenza A and B Viruses by Impeding Viral RNA Synthesis.
Abstract: Accumulating data suggest that tripartite-motif-containing (TRIM) proteins participate in host responses to viral infections, either by acting as direct antiviral restriction factors or through regulating innate immune signaling of the host. Of >70 TRIMs, TRIM56 is a restriction factor of several positive-strand RNA viruses, including three members of the family Flaviviridae(yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus) and a human coronavirus (OC43), and this ability invariably depends upon the E3 ligase activity of TRIM56. However, the impact of TRIM56 on negative-strand RNA viruses remains unclear. Here, we show that TRIM56 puts a check on replication of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture but does not inhibit Sendai virus or human metapneumovirus, two paramyxoviruses. Interestingly, the anti-influenza virus activity was independent of the E3 ligase activity, B-box, or coiled-coil domain. Rather, deletion of a 63-residue-long C-terminal-tail portion of TRIM56 abrogated the antiviral function. Moreover, expression of this short C-terminal segment curtailed the replication of influenza viruses as effectively as that of full-length TRIM56. Mechanistically, TRIM56 was found to specifically impede intracellular influenza virus RNA synthesis. Together, these data reveal a novel antiviral activity of TRIM56 against influenza A and B viruses and provide insights into the mechanism by which TRIM56 restricts these medically important orthomyxoviruses. Options to treat influenza are limited, and drug-resistant influenza virus strains can emerge through minor genetic changes. Understanding novel virus-host interactions that alter influenza virus fitness may reveal new targets/approaches for therapeutic interventions. We show here that TRIM56, a tripartite-motif protein, is an intrinsic host restriction factor of influenza A and B viruses. Unlike its antiviral actions against positive-strand RNA viruses, the anti-influenza virus activity of TRIM56 was independent of the E3 ligase activity. Rather, expression of a short segment within the very C-terminal tail of TRIM56 inhibited the replication of influenza viruses as effectively as that of full-length TRIM56 by specifically targeting viral RNA synthesis. These data reveal the remarkable multifaceted activity of TRIM56, which has developed multiple domains to inhibit multiple viral families. They also raise the possibility of developing a broad-spectrum, TRIM56-based antiviral approach for addition to influenza prophylaxis and/or control strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral activity of TRIM56 protein against influenza viruses and its mechanism, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Host immunity and pathogen diversity: A computational study.
Abstract: The distinctive features of human influenza A phylogeny have inspired many mathematical and computational studies of viral infections spreading in a host population, but our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the coupled evolution of host immunity, disease incidence and viral antigenic properties is far from complete. In this paper we explore the epidemiology and the phylogeny of a rapidly mutating pathogen in a host population with a weak immune response, that allows re-infection by the same strain and provides little cross-immunity. We find that mutation generates explosive diversity and that, as diversity grows, the system is driven to a very high prevalence level. This is in stark contrast with the behavior of similar models where mutation gives rise to a large epidemic followed by disease extinction, under the assumption that infection with a strain provides lifelong immunity. For low mutation rates, the behavior of the system shows the main qualitative features of influenza evolution. Our results highlight the importance of heterogeneity in the human immune response for understanding influenza A phenomenology. They are meant as a first step toward computationally affordable, individual based models including more complex host-pathogen interactions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models host immunity and pathogen diversity computationally but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Lessons from a French collaborative case-control study in cystic fibrosis patients during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemy.
Abstract: Viral infections such as influenza are thought to impact respiratory parameters and to promote infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the real morbidity of the influenza virus in CF needs to be further investigated because previous studies were only observational. CF patients were included in a case-control study (n = 44 cases and n = 371 controls) during the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza. Cases were patients with polymerase reaction chain-confirmed influenza A/H1N1 infection. Controls did not report any influenza symptoms during the same period. Sputum colonization and lung function were monitored during 1 year after inclusion. Cases were significantly younger than controls (mean(SD) 14.9 years(11) versus 20.1 years (13.2) and significantly less frequently colonized with P. aeruginosa (34 % versus 53 %). During influenza infection, 74 % of cases had pulmonary exacerbation, 92 % had antibiotics adapted to their usual sputum colonization and 82 % were treated with oseltamivir. Two cases required lung transplantation after A/H1N1 infection (one had not received oseltamivir and the other one had been treated late). The cases received a mean number of antibiotic treatments significantly higher during the year after the influenza infection (mean(SD) 2.8 (2.4) for cases versus 1.8(2.1) for controls; p = 0.002). An age-matched comparison did not demonstrate any significant modification of bronchopulmonary bacterial colonization during the year after influenza infection nor any significant change in FEV1 at months 1, 3 and 12 after A/H1N1 infection. Our results do not demonstrate any change in sputum colonization nor significant lung disease progression after pandemic A/H1N1 influenza. Clinical Trials.gov registration number: NCT01499914.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on clinical outcomes and bacterial colonization in cystic fibrosis patients during H1N1 infection, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: Serological evidence of H9N2 avian influenza virus exposure among poultry workers from Fars province of Iran.
Abstract: Since the 1990s, influenza A viruses of the H9N2 subtype have been causing infections in the poultry population around the globe. This influenza subtype is widely circulating in poultry and human cases of AI H9N2 have been sporadically reported in countries where this virus is endemic in domestic birds. The wide circulation of H9N2 viruses throughout Europe and Asia along with their ability to cause direct infection in mammals and humans, raises public health concerns. H9N2 AI was reported for the first time in Iran in 1998 and at present it is endemic in poultry. This study was carried out to evaluate the exposure to H9N2 AI viruses among poultry workers from the Fars province. 100 poultry workers and 100 healthy individuals with no professional exposure to poultry took part in this study. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against two distinct H9N2 avian influenza viruses, which showed different phylogenetic clustering and important molecular differences, such as at the amino acid (aa) position 226 (Q/L) (H3 numbering), using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. Results showed that 17 % of the poultry workers were positive for the A/chicken/Iran/10VIR/854-5/2008 virus in MN test and 12 % in HI test using the titer ≥40 as positive cut-off value. Only 2 % of the poultry workers were positive for the A/chicken/Iran/12VIR/9630/1998 virus. Seroprevalence of non exposed individuals for both H9N2 strains was below 3 % by both tests. Statistical analyses models showed that exposure to poultry significantly increases the risk of infection with H9N2 virus. The results have demonstrated that exposure to avian H9N2 viruses had occurred among poultry workers in the Fars province of Iran. Continuous surveillance programmes should be implemented to monitor the presence of avian influenza infections in humans and to evaluate their potential threat to poultry workers and public health.

Title: Replication-Competent Influenza A and B Viruses Expressing a Fluorescent Dynamic Timer Protein for In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
Abstract: Influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV, respectively) cause annual seasonal human respiratory disease epidemics. In addition, IAVs have been implicated in occasional pandemics with inordinate health and economic consequences. Studying influenza viruses in vitro or in vivo requires the use of laborious secondary methodologies to identify infected cells. To circumvent this requirement, replication-competent infectious influenza viruses expressing an easily traceable fluorescent reporter protein can be used. Timer is a fluorescent protein that undergoes a time-dependent color emission conversion from green to red. The rate of spectral change is independent of Timer protein concentration and can be used to chronologically measure the duration of its expression. Here, we describe the generation of replication-competent IAV and IBV where the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was fused to the fluorescent dynamic Timer protein. Timer-expressing IAV and IBV displayed similar plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics to wild-type viruses in tissue culture. Within infected cells, Timer's spectral shift can be used to measure the rate and cell-to-cell spread of infection using fluorescent microscopy, plate readers, or flow cytometry. The progression of Timer-expressing IAV infection was also evaluated in a mouse model, demonstrating the feasibility to characterize IAV cell-to-cell infections in vivo. By providing the ability to chronologically track viral spread, Timer-expressing influenza viruses are an excellent option to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo dynamics of viral infection.

Reason: The study describes the generation of fluorescent reporter influenza viruses for tracking infection dynamics but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: H7N9 Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Is Highly Immunogenic, Prevents Virus Replication, and Protects Against Severe Bronchopneumonia in Ferrets.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses continue to cross the species barrier, and if such viruses become transmissible among humans, it would pose a great threat to public health. Since its emergence in China in 2013, H7N9 has caused considerable morbidity and mortality. In the absence of a universal influenza vaccine, preparedness includes development of subtype-specific vaccines. In this study, we developed and evaluated in ferrets an intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) against H7N9 based on the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) cold-adapted master donor virus. We demonstrate that the LAIV is attenuated and safe in ferrets and induces high hemagglutination- and neuraminidase-inhibiting and virus-neutralizing titers. The antibodies against hemagglutinin were also cross-reactive with divergent H7 strains. To assess efficacy, we used an intratracheal challenge ferret model in which an acute severe viral pneumonia is induced that closely resembles viral pneumonia observed in severe human cases. A single- and two-dose strategy provided complete protection against severe pneumonia and prevented virus replication. The protective effect of the two-dose strategy appeared better than the single dose only on the microscopic level in the lungs. We observed, however, an increased lymphocytic infiltration after challenge in single-vaccinated animals and hypothesize that this a side effect of the model.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates vaccine immunogenicity and protection in ferrets but does not analyze viral genotypes in relation to phenotypes.

Title: Design and evaluation of novel interferon lambda analogs with enhanced antiviral activity and improved drug attributes.
Abstract: Type III interferons (IFNs) (also called IFN-λ: IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, and IFN-λ4) are critical players in the defense against viral infection of mucosal epithelial cells, where the activity of type I IFNs is weak, and unlike type I IFNs that are associated with severe and diverse side effects, type III IFNs cause minimal side effects due to the highly restricted expression of their receptors, and thus appear to be promising agents for the treatment and prevention of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral infection. However, the antiviral potency of natural type III IFNs is weak compared to type I and, although IFN-λ3 possesses the highest bioactivity among the type III IFNs, IFN-λ1, instead of IFN-λ3, is being developed as a therapeutic drug due to the difficulty to express IFN-λ3 in the prokaryotic expression system. Here, to develop optimal IFN-λ molecules with improved drug attributes, we designed a series of IFN-λ analogs by replacing critical amino acids of IFN-λ1 with the IFN-λ3 counterparts, and vice versa. Four of the designed analogs were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli with high yield and were easily purified from inclusion bodies. Interestingly, all four analogs showed potent activity in inducing the expression of the antiviral genes MxA and OAS and two of them, analog-6 and -7, displayed an unexpected high potency that is higher than that of type I IFN (IFN-α2a) in activating the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-luciferase reporter. Importantly, both analog-6 and -7 effectively inhibited replication of hepatitis C virus in Huh-7.5.1 cells, with an IC50 that is comparable to that of IFN-α2a; and consistent with the roles of IFN-λ in mucosal epithelia, both analogs potently inhibited replication of H3N2 influenza A virus in A549 cells. Together, these studies identified two IFN-λ analogs as candidates to be developed as novel antiviral biologics.

Title: Targeting Viral Proteostasis Limits Influenza Virus, HIV, and Dengue Virus Infection.
Abstract: Viruses are obligate parasites and thus require the machinery of the host cell to replicate. Inhibition of host factors co-opted during active infection is a strategy hosts use to suppress viral replication and a potential pan-antiviral therapy. To define the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is thus crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease. In this report, we generated fully infectious tagged influenza viruses and used infection-based proteomics to identify pivotal arms of cellular signaling required for influenza virus growth and infectivity. Using mathematical modeling and genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we revealed that modulation of Sec61-mediated cotranslational translocation selectively impaired glycoprotein proteostasis of influenza as well as HIV and dengue viruses and led to inhibition of viral growth and infectivity. Thus, by studying virus-human protein-protein interactions in the context of active replication, we have identified targetable host factors for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host factors affecting viral proteostasis but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza annual report, 2014.
Abstract: The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne is part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In 2014 the Centre received a total of 5,374 influenza samples from laboratories primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Viruses were characterised by their antigenic, genetic and antiviral drug resistance properties. Of the viruses successfully analysed 52% were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The majority of these were antigenically and genetically similar to the WHO recommended reference strain for the 2014 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Results for A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses suggested that circulating viruses of this subtype and lineage, respectively, had undergone antigenic and/or genetic changes, consistent with the decision by WHO to change recommended strains for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. A small number of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses had highly reduced inhibition to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The Centre also undertook primary isolation of vaccine candidate viruses directly into eggs. A total of 38 viruses were successfully isolated in eggs, of which 1 (B/Phuket/3073/2013) was included in the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: Discovery of Influenza A Virus Sequence Pairs and Their Combinations for Simultaneous Heterosubtypic Targeting that Hedge against Antiviral Resistance.
Abstract: The multiple circulating human influenza A virus subtypes coupled with the perpetual genomic mutations and segment reassortment events challenge the development of effective therapeutics. The capacity to drug most RNAs motivates the investigation on viral RNA targets. 123,060 segment sequences from 35,938 strains of the most prevalent subtypes also infecting humans-H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9, were used to identify 1,183 conserved RNA target sequences (≥15-mer) in the internal segments. 100% theoretical coverage in simultaneous heterosubtypic targeting is achieved by pairing specific sequences from the same segment ("Duals") or from two segments ("Doubles"); 1,662 Duals and 28,463 Doubles identified. By combining specific Duals and/or Doubles to form a target graph wherein an edge connecting two vertices (target sequences) represents a Dual or Double, it is possible to hedge against antiviral resistance besides maintaining 100% heterosubtypic coverage. To evaluate the hedging potential, we define the hedge-factor as the minimum number of resistant target sequences that will render the graph to become resistant i.e. eliminate all the edges therein; a target sequence or a graph is considered resistant when it cannot achieve 100% heterosubtypic coverage. In an n-vertices graph (n ≥ 3), the hedge-factor is maximal (= n- 1) when it is a complete graph i.e. every distinct pair in a graph is either a Dual or Double. Computational analyses uncover an extensive number of complete graphs of different sizes. Monte Carlo simulations show that the mutation counts and time elapsed for a target graph to become resistant increase with the hedge-factor. Incidentally, target sequences which were reported to reduce virus titre in experiments are included in our target graphs. The identity of target sequence pairs for heterosubtypic targeting and their combinations for hedging antiviral resistance are useful toolkits to construct target graphs for different therapeutic objectives.

Title: The Influenza Virus H5N1 Infection Can Induce ROS Production for Viral Replication and Host Cell Death in A549 Cells Modulated by Human Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) Overexpression.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic H5N1 infections are often accompanied by excessive pro-inflammatory response, high viral titer, and apoptosis; as such, the efficient control of these infections poses a great challenge. The pathogenesis of influenza virus infection is also related to oxidative stress. However, the role of endogenic genes with antioxidant effect in the control of influenza viruses, especially H5N1 viruses, should be further investigated. In this study, the H5N1 infection in lung epithelial cells decreased Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) expression at mRNA and protein levels. Forced SOD1 expression significantly inhibited the H5N1-induced increase in reactive oxygen species, decreased pro-inflammatory response, prevented p65 and p38 phosphorylation, and impeded viral ribonucleoprotein nuclear export and viral replication. The SOD1 overexpression also rescued H5N1-induced cellular apoptosis and alleviated H5N1-caused mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, this study described the role of SOD1 in the replication of H5N1 influenza virus and emphasized the relevance of this enzyme in the control of H5N1 replication in epithelial cells. Pharmacological modulation or targeting SOD1 may open a new way to fight H5N1 influenza virus.

Title: [Development of a real-time RT-PCR for detection of equine influenza virus].
Abstract: Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease in horses caused by influenza A viruses. In this work a real-time RT-PCR for fast and sensitive diagnosis of equine influenza viruses (EIV) targeting a highly conserved region of the matrix gene was developed. In addition two RT-PCR methods for the amplification of large parts of the matrix- and HA gene were adapted for molecular-epidemiological characterization of viruses. The primers of the real-time RT-PCR had homologies of 99.4% to EIV- and 97.7% to all influenza A viral sequences, whereas the minor groove binder (MGB) probe showed homologies of 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. These high values allow application of the assay for influenza viruses in other species. Using 20 equine, 11 porcine and 2 avian samples, diagnostic suitability of the assay was confirmed. High specificity for influenza viruses was shown both experimentally and by software simulation. The assay analytical sensitivity was at 10(2)-10(3) copies of RNA and 10(0)-10(1) copies of DNA, respectively. This allows virus detection also in circumstances of minor viral shedding. All amplified EIV sequences were classified phylogenetically within the known lineages.

Title: Sprouty-Related Ena/Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein Homology 1-Domain-Containing Protein-2 Critically Regulates Influenza A Virus-Induced Pneumonia.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes acute respiratory infections that induce annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. Although a number of studies indicated that the virus-induced intracellular signaling events are important in combating influenza virus infection, the mechanism how specific molecule plays a critical role among various intracellular signaling events remains unknown. Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade is one of the key signaling pathways during influenza virus infection, and the Sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein has recently been identified as a negative regulator of Raf-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Here, we examined the role of Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade through sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein in influenza A viral infection because the expression of sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein was significantly enhanced in human influenza viral-induced pneumonia autopsy samples. Prospective animal trial. Research laboratory. Wild-type and sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 knockout mice inoculated with influenza A. Wild-type or sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 knockout mice were infected by intranasal inoculation of influenza A (A/PR/8). An equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline was inoculated intranasally into mock-infected mice. Influenza A infection of sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 knockout mice led to higher mortality with greater viral load, excessive inflammation, and enhanced cytokine production than wild-type mice. Administration of MEK inhibitor, U0126, improved mortality and reduced both viral load and cytokine levels. Furthermore, bone marrow chimeras indicated that influenza A-induced lung pathology was most severe when sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 expression was lacking in nonimmune cell populations. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed knockdown of sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 led to enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, resulting that viral clearance was regulated by sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 expression through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway in murine lung epithelial cells. These data support an important function of sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 in controlling influenza virus-induced pneumonia and viral replication. Sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1-domain-containing protein-2 may be a novel therapeutic target for controlling the immune response against influenza influenza A virus infection.

Title: Human Heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40/DnaJB1) promotes influenza A virus replication by assisting nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins.
Abstract: A unique feature of influenza A virus (IAV) life cycle is replication of the viral genome in the host cell nucleus. The nuclear import of IAV genome is an indispensable step in establishing virus infection. IAV nucleoprotein (NP) is known to mediate the nuclear import of viral genome via its nuclear localization signals. Here, we demonstrate that cellular heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40/DnaJB1) facilitates the nuclear import of incoming IAV viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) and is important for efficient IAV replication. Hsp40 was found to interact with NP component of IAV RNPs during early stages of infection. This interaction is mediated by the J domain of Hsp40 and N-terminal region of NP. Drug or RNAi mediated inhibition of Hsp40 resulted in reduced nuclear import of IAV RNPs, diminished viral polymerase function and attenuates overall viral replication. Hsp40 was also found to be required for efficient association between NP and importin alpha, which is crucial for IAV RNP nuclear translocation. These studies demonstrate an important role for cellular chaperone Hsp40/DnaJB1 in influenza A virus life cycle by assisting nuclear trafficking of viral ribonucleoproteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host protein Hsp40's role in viral ribonucleoprotein nuclear import and replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Targeting host calpain proteases decreases influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) trigger contagious acute respiratory diseases. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IAV pathogenesis and host immune responses is required for the development of more efficient treatments of severe influenza. Calpains are intracellular proteases that participate in diverse cellular responses, including inflammation. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of calpain signaling in IAV pathogenesis. Calpain expression and activity were found altered in IAV-infected bronchial epithelial cells. With the use of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing, specific synthetic inhibitors of calpains, and mice overexpressing calpastatin, we found that calpain inhibition dampens IAV replication and IAV-triggered secretion of proinflammatory mediators and leukocyte infiltration. Remarkably, calpain inhibition has a protective impact in IAV infection, since it significantly reduced mortality of mice challenged not only by seasonal H3N2- but also by hypervirulent H5N1 IAV strains. Hence, our study suggests that calpains are promising therapeutic targets for treating IAV acute pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host calpain proteases' role in influenza infection and pathogenesis, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Epidemiology of human coronavirus NL63 infection among hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Taiwan.
Abstract: Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 is recognized in association with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010-2011. Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16-25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains. Understanding epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan provides an insight for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper surveys epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-NL63 but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Immuno-modulating properties of saliphenylhalamide, SNS-032, obatoclax, and gemcitabine.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) impact the public health and global economy by causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Several anti-IAV drugs are available and many are in development. However, the question remains which of these antiviral agents may allow activation of immune responses and protect patients against co- and re-infections. To answer to this question, we analysed immuno-modulating properties of the antivirals saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe), SNS-032, obatoclax, and gemcitabine, and found that only gemcitabine did not impair immune responses in infected cells. It also allowed activation of innate immune responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interferon alpha (IFNα)-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, immuno-mediators produced by gemcitabine-treated IAV-infected macrophages were able to prime immune responses in non-infected cells. Thus, we identified an antiviral agent which might be beneficial for treatment of patients with severe viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes immuno-modulating properties of antiviral agents without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Anti-inflammatory effects of indirubin derivatives on influenza A virus-infected human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses global threats to human health. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction are major complications in patients with severe influenza infection. This may be explained by the recent studies which highlighted the role of the pulmonary endothelium as the center of innate immune cells recruitment and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In this report, we examined the potential immunomodulatory effects of two indirubin derivatives, indirubin-3'-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804) and indirubin-3'-oxime (E231), on IAV (H9N2) infected-human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Infection of H9N2 on HPMECs induced a high level of chemokines and cytokines production including IP-10, RANTES, IL-6, IFN-β and IFN-γ1. Post-treatment of E804 or E231 could significantly suppress the production of these cytokines. H9N2 infection rapidly triggered the activation of innate immunity through phosphorylation of signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Using specific inhibitors or small-interfering RNA, we confirmed that indirubin derivatives can suppress H9N2-induced cytokines production through MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways. These results underscore the immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives on pulmonary endothelium and its therapeutic potential on IAV-infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on anti-inflammatory effects of indirubin derivatives on infected cells, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Novel Polyanions Inhibiting Replication of Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Novel sulfonated derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (NSPAHs) and N-sulfonated chitosan (NSCH) have been synthesized, and their activity against influenza A and B viruses has been studied and compared with that of a series of carrageenans, marine polysaccharides of well-documented anti-influenza activity. NSPAHs were found to be nontoxic and very soluble in water, in contrast to gel-forming and thus generally poorly soluble carrageenans.In vitroandex vivostudies using susceptible cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and fully differentiated human airway epithelial cultures) demonstrated the antiviral effectiveness of NSPAHs. The activity of NSPAHs was proportional to the molecular mass of the chain and the degree of substitution of amino groups with sulfonate groups. Mechanistic studies showed that the NSPAHs and carrageenans inhibit influenza A and B virus assembly in the cell.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies antiviral activity of novel polyanions inhibiting influenza virus replication, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Interferon-mediated antiviral activities of Angelica tenuissima Nakai and its active components.
Abstract: Angelica tenuissima Nakai is a widely used commodity in traditional medicine. Nevertheless, no study has been conducted on the antiviral and immune-modulatory properties of an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai. In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activities and the mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, an effective dose of Angelica tenuissima Nakai markedly inhibited the replication of Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Coxsackie virus, and Enterovirus (EV-71) on epithelial (HEK293T/HeLa) and immune (RAW264.7) cells. Such inhibition can be described by the induction of the antiviral state in cells by antiviral, IFNrelated gene induction and secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated BALB/c mice displayed higher survivability and lower lung viral titers when challenged with lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, and H9N2). We also found that Angelica tenuissima Nakai can induce the secretion of IL-6, IFN-λ, and local IgA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated mice, which correlating with the observed prophylactic effects. In HPLC analysis, we found the presence of several compounds in the aqueous fraction and among them; we evaluated antiviral properties of ferulic acid. Therefore, an extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai and its components, including ferulic acid, play roles as immunomodulators and may be potential candidates for novel anti-viral/anti-influenza agents.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of Angelica tenuissima extract, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Epidemic Reconstruction in a Phylogenetics Framework: Transmission Trees as Partitions of the Node Set.
Abstract: The use of genetic data to reconstruct the transmission tree of infectious disease epidemics and outbreaks has been the subject of an increasing number of studies, but previous approaches have usually either made assumptions that are not fully compatible with phylogenetic inference, or, where they have based inference on a phylogeny, have employed a procedure that requires this tree to be fixed. At the same time, the coalescent-based models of the pathogen population that are employed in the methods usually used for time-resolved phylogeny reconstruction are a considerable simplification of epidemic process, as they assume that pathogen lineages mix freely. Here, we contribute a new method that is simultaneously a phylogeny reconstruction method for isolates taken from an epidemic, and a procedure for transmission tree reconstruction. We observe that, if one or more samples is taken from each host in an epidemic or outbreak and these are used to build a phylogeny, a transmission tree is equivalent to a partition of the set of nodes of this phylogeny, such that each partition element is a set of nodes that is connected in the full tree and contains all the tips corresponding to samples taken from one and only one host. We then implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure for simultaneous sampling from the spaces of both trees, utilising a newly-designed set of phylogenetic tree proposals that also respect node partitions. We calculate the posterior probability of these partitioned trees based on a model that acknowledges the population structure of an epidemic by employing an individual-based disease transmission model and a coalescent process taking place within each host. We demonstrate our method, first using simulated data, and then with sequences taken from the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak that occurred in the Netherlands in 2003. We show that it is superior to established coalescent methods for reconstructing the topology and node heights of the phylogeny and performs well for transmission tree reconstruction when the phylogeny is well-resolved by the genetic data, but caution that this will often not be the case in practice and that existing genetic and epidemiological data should be used to configure such analyses whenever possible. This method is available for use by the research community as part of BEAST, one of the most widely-used packages for reconstruction of dated phylogenies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic and transmission tree reconstruction methods without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Virus evolution and transmission in an ever more connected world.
Abstract: The frequency and global impact of infectious disease outbreaks, particularly those caused by emerging viruses, demonstrate the need for a better understanding of how spatial ecology and pathogen evolution jointly shape epidemic dynamics. Advances in computational techniques and the increasing availability of genetic and geospatial data are helping to address this problem, particularly when both information sources are combined. Here, we review research at the intersection of evolutionary biology, human geography and epidemiology that is working towards an integrated view of spatial incidence, host mobility and viral genetic diversity. We first discuss how empirical studies have combined viral spatial and genetic data, focusing particularly on the contribution of evolutionary analyses to epidemiology and disease control. Second, we explore the interplay between virus evolution and global dispersal in more depth for two pathogens: human influenza A virus and chikungunya virus. We discuss the opportunities for future research arising from new analyses of human transportation and trade networks, as well as the associated challenges in accessing and sharing relevant spatial and genetic data.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing viral evolution and transmission dynamics without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Abstract: We evaluate sequence data from the PathChip high-density hybridization array for epidemiological interpretation of detected pathogens.

For a positive polio detection, recent infection could be excluded based on vaccine strain similarity.

Title: Evaluation of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Candidate Pandemic Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (pLAIV) Against Influenza A(H7N9).
Abstract: We evaluated a candidate A/Anhui/2013(H7N9) pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (pLAIV) in healthy adults, and assessed the ability of 1 or 2 doses to induce immune memory. Healthy subjects in 2 age groups (18-49 years and 50-70 years) with undetectable hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody to H7N9 were enrolled. Younger subjects received either 1 or 2 intranasal doses of 10(7.0) fluorescent focus units of A/Anhui/1/2013 pLAIV, while older subjects received a single dose. All subjects received a single 30-µg dose of unadjuvanted, antigenically matched A/Shanghai2/2013(H7N9) pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine (pIIV) 12 weeks after their first dose of pLAIV. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Serum HAI antibody responses were detected in 0 of 32 younger subjects and 1 of 17 older subjects after 1 dose of pLAIV and in 2 of 16 younger subjects after a second dose. Strong serum antibody responses were detected after a single subsequent dose of pIIV that was broadly reactive against H7 influenza viruses. An A(H7N9) pLAIV candidate was safe in both age groups. Priming with pLAIV resulted in responses to subsequent pIIV that exceeded those seen in naive subjects in previous reports. The A(H7N9) pLAIV induces strong immune memory that can be demonstrated by exposure to subsequent antigenic challenge. NCT01995695 and NCT02274545.

Title: Design and testing of multiplex RT-PCR primers for the rapid detection of influenza A virus genomic segments: Application to equine influenza virus.
Abstract: The avian influenza A virus causes respiratory infections in animal species. It can undergo genomic recombination with newly obtained genetic material through an interspecies transmission. However, the process is an unpredictable event, making it difficult to predict the emergence of a new pandemic virus and distinguish its origin, especially when the virus is the result of multiple infections. Therefore, identifying a novel influenza is entirely dependent on sequencing its whole genome. Occasionally, however, it can be time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive when sequencing many influenza viruses. To compensate for the difficulty, we developed a rapid, cost-effective, and simple multiplex RT-PCR to identify the viral genomic segments. As an example to evaluate its performance, H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) was studied for the purpose. In developing this protocol to amplify the EIV eight-segments, a series of processes, including phylogenetic analysis based on different influenza hosts, in silico analyses to estimate primer specificity, coverage, and variation scores, and investigation of host-specific amino acids, were progressively conducted to reduce or eliminate the negative factors that might affect PCR amplification. Selectively, EIV specific primers were synthesized with dual priming oligonucleotides (DPO) system to increase primer specificity. As a result, 16 primer pairs were selected to screen the dominantly circulating H3N8 EIV 8 genome segments: PA (3), PB2 (1), PA (3), NP (3), NA8 (2), HA3 (1), NS (1), and M (2). The diagnostic performance of the primers was evaluated with eight sets composing of four segment combinations using viral samples from various influenza hosts. The PCR results suggest that the multiplex RT-PCR has a wide range of applications in detection and diagnosis of newly emerging EIVs. Further, the proposed procedures of designing multiplex primers are expected to be used for detecting other animal influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on primer design for detection of viral genomic segments without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Transcription Factor Runx3 Is Induced by Influenza A Virus and Double-Strand RNA and Mediates Airway Epithelial Cell Apoptosis.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) targets airway epithelial cells and exploits the host cell machinery to replicate, causing respiratory illness in annual epidemics and pandemics of variable severity. The high rate of antigenic drift (viral mutation) and the putative antigenic shift (reassortant strains) have raised the need to find the host cell inducible factors modulating IAV replication and its pathogenesis to develop more effective antiviral treatment. In this study, we found for the first time that transcription factor Runx3, a developmental regulator and tumor suppressor, was induced by IAV H1N1 and H3N2, viral RNA, a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, and type-II interferon-γ (IFNγ) in human airway epithelial cells. Whereas Runx3 was essentially not induced by type-I IFNα and type-III IFNλ, we show that Runx3 induction by IAV infection and viral RNA is mediated through the innate immune receptor MDA5 and the IκB kinase-β-NF-κB pathway. Moreover, we provide substantial evidence indicating that Runx3 plays a crucial role in airway epithelial cell apoptosis induced by IAV infection and dsRNA through the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Thus, we have identified Runx3 as an inducible and important transcription factor modulating IAV-induced host epithelial cell apoptosis.

Reason: The paper studies host transcription factor induction and its role in apoptosis during infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: 1,2,3-Triazolyl-4-oxoquinolines: A feasible beginning for promising chemical structures to inhibit oseltamivir-resistant influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: We described the synthesis of a new congener series of 1,2,3-triazolyl-4-oxoquinolines and evaluated their ability to inhibit oseltamivir (OST)-resistant influenza strains. Oxoquinoline derivative 1i was the most potent compound within this series, inhibiting 94% of wild-type (WT) influenza neuraminidase (NA) activity. Compound 1i inhibited influenza virus replication with an EC50 of 0.2μM with less cytotoxicity than OST, and also inhibited different OST-resistant NAs. These results suggest that 1,2,3-triazolyl-4-oxoquinolines represent promising lead molecules for further anti-influenza drug design.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on chemical inhibitors of influenza virus neuraminidase activity without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Saikosaponin A inhibits influenza A virus replication and lung immunopathology.
Abstract: Fatal influenza outcomes result from a combination of rapid virus replication and collateral lung tissue damage caused by exaggerated pro-inflammatory host immune cell responses. There are few therapeutic agents that target both biological processes for the attenuation of influenza-induced lung pathology. We show that Saikosaponin A, a bioactive triterpene saponin with previouslyestablished anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrates both in vitro and in vivo anti-viral activity against influenza A virus infections. Saikosaponin A attenuated the replication of three different influenza A virus strains, including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. This anti-viral activity occurred through both downregulation of NF-κB signaling and caspase 3-dependent virus ribonucleoprotein nuclear export as demonstrated by NF-κB subunit p65 and influenza virus nucleoprotein nuclear translocation studies in influenza virus infected A549 cells. Critically, Saikosaponin A also attenuated viral replication, aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine production and lung histopathology in the widely established H1N1 PR8 model of influenza A virus lethality in C57BL/6 mice. Flow cytometry studies of mouse bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed that SSa exerted immunomodulatory effects through a selective attenuation of lung neutrophil and monocyte recruitment during the early peak of the innate immune response to PR8 infection. Altogether, our results indicate that Saikosaponin A possesses novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of pathological influenza virus infections.

Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of a compound against influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Longitudinal analysis of the peripheral B cell repertoire reveals unique effects of immunization with a new influenza virus strain.
Abstract: Despite the potential to produce antibodies that can neutralize different virus (heterotypic neutralization), there is no knowledge of why vaccination against influenza induces protection predominantly against the utilized viral strains (homotypic response). Identification of structural patterns of the B cell repertoire associated to heterotypic neutralization may contribute to identify relevant epitopes for a universal vaccine against influenza. Blood samples were collected from volunteers immunized with 2008/2009 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV), pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV) and the 2014/2015 TIV. Neutralization was assessed by hemagglutination and microneutralization test. IgG V(H) amplicons derived from peripheral blood RNA from pre-immune and 7 days post vaccination were subjected to 454-Roche sequencing. Full reconstruction of the sampled repertoires was done with ImmunediveRsity. The TIV induced a predominantly homotypic neutralizing serologic response, while the 09 MIV induced a heterotypic neutralizing seroconversion in 17% of the individuals. Both the 08/09 and the 14/15 TIV were associated with a reduction in clonotypic diversity, whereas 09 MIV was the opposite. Moreover, TIV and MIV induced distinctive patterns of IGHV segment use that are consistent with B cell selection by conserved antigenic determinants shared by the pre-pandemic and the pandemic strains. However, low somatic hypermutation rates in IgG after 09 MIV immunization, but not after 08/09 and 14/15 TIV immunization were observed. Furthermore, no evidence of the original antigenic sin was found in the same individuals after vaccination with the three vaccines. Immunization with a new influenza virus strain (2009 pdmH1N1) induced unique effects in the peripheral B cell repertoire clonal structure, a stereotyped response involving distinctive IGHV segment use and low somatic hypermutation levels. These parameters were contrastingly different to those observed in response to pre-pandemic and post-pandemic vaccination, and may be the result of clonal selection of common antigenic determinants, as well as germinal center-independent responses that wane as the pandemic strain becomes seasonal. Our findings may contribute in the understanding of the structural and cellular basis required to develop a universal influenza vaccine.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on B cell repertoire changes and immune response to vaccination without direct links between viral genotypes and viral phenotypes.

Title: Quantifying the risk of pandemic influenza virus evolution by mutation and re-assortment.
Abstract: Large outbreaks of zoonotic influenza A virus (IAV) infections may presage an influenza pandemic. However, the likelihood that an airborne-transmissible variant evolves upon zoonotic infection or co-infection with zoonotic and seasonal IAVs remains poorly understood, as does the relative importance of accumulating mutations versus re-assortment in this process. Using discrete-time probabilistic models, we determined quantitative probability ranges that transmissible variants with 1-5 mutations and transmissible re-assortants evolve after a given number of zoonotic IAV infections. The systematic exploration of a large population of model parameter values was designed to account for uncertainty and variability in influenza virus infection, epidemiological and evolutionary processes. The models suggested that immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of generating IAV variants with pandemic potential by accumulation of mutations. Yet, both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals could generate high viral loads of single and double mutants, which may facilitate their onward transmission and the subsequent accumulation of additional 1-2 mutations in newly-infected individuals. This may result in the evolution of a full transmissible genotype along short chains of contact transmission. Although co-infection with zoonotic and seasonal IAVs was shown to be a rare event, it consistently resulted in high viral loads of re-assortants, which may facilitate their onward transmission among humans. The prevention or limitation of zoonotic IAV infection in immunocompromised and contact individuals, including health care workers, as well as vaccination against seasonal IAVs-limiting the risk of co-infection-should be considered fundamental tools to thwart the evolution of a novel pandemic IAV by accumulation of mutations and re-assortment.

Reason: This is a modeling study quantifying risk of pandemic evolution via mutation and reassortment, but does not provide explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Mir-302c mediates influenza A virus-induced IFNβ expression by targeting NF-κB inducing kinase.
Abstract: Little is known about the role of microRNA during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We observed that NIK 3'UTR luciferase activity was elevated during IAV infection. Further studies demonstrated that miR-302c reduced NIK expression, resulting in the reduction of IFNβ mRNA expression. We found that miR-302c prevented the translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus. Furthermore, IAV infection downregulated miR-302c expression, leading to the activation of IFNβ expression and the inhibition of viral replication. Compared to miR-302c, miR-520e cannot promote viral replication and production, although the two microRNAs target the same site of the NIK 3'UTR. Collectively, our work defines a novel signaling pathway implicated in the control of IFNβ mRNA expression during IAV infection.

Title: Estimate of within population incremental selection through branch imbalance in lineage trees.
Abstract: Incremental selection within a population, defined as limited fitness changes following mutation, is an important aspect of many evolutionary processes. Strongly advantageous or deleterious mutations are detected using the synonymous to non-synonymous mutations ratio. However, there are currently no precise methods to estimate incremental selection. We here provide for the first time such a detailed method and show its precision in multiple cases of micro-evolution. The proposed method is a novel mixed lineage tree/sequence based method to detect within population selection as defined by the effect of mutations on the average number of offspring. Specifically, we propose to measure the log of the ratio between the number of leaves in lineage trees branches following synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. The method requires a high enough number of sequences, and a large enough number of independent mutations. It assumes that all mutations are independent events. It does not require of a baseline model and is practically not affected by sampling biases. We show the method's wide applicability by testing it on multiple cases of micro-evolution. We show that it can detect genes and inter-genic regions using the selection rate and detect selection pressures in viral proteins and in the immune response to pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes a novel method to detect selection in populations using sequence data but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011.
Abstract: Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.
Relevant: False
Reason: Uses phylogenetic analysis to investigate transmission chains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Experimental infection of peridomestic mammals with emergent H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) influenza A virus: Implications for biosecurity and wet markets.
Abstract: During 2013, a novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China and subsequently caused large economic and public health burdens. We experimentally infected three common peridomestic wild mammals with H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) IAV. Striped skunks exhibited the highest burden of disease followed by raccoons and cottontail rabbits. Striped skunks also produced the highest levels of viral shedding (up to 10(6.4)PFU/mL nasal flush) followed by cottontail rabbits (up to 10(5.8)PFU/mL nasal flush) and raccoons (up to 10(5.2)PFU/mL nasal flush). Thus, various mammalian species, especially those that are peridomestic, could play a role in the epidemiology of emergent H7N9 IAV. Mammals should be accounted for in biosecurity plans associated with H7N9 and their presence in wet markets, dependent on species, could lead to increased transmission among interspecific species aggregations and may also pose an elevated zoonotic disease risk to visitors and workers of such markets.
Relevant: False
Reason: Experimental infection study focusing on viral shedding and disease burden in mammals without detailed genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Drug Discovery of Host CLK1 Inhibitors for Influenza Treatment.
Abstract: The rapid evolution of influenza virus makes antiviral drugs less effective, which is considered to be a major bottleneck in antiviral therapy. The key proteins in the host cells, which are related with the replication cycle of influenza virus, are regarded as potential drug targets due to their distinct advantage of lack of evolution and drug resistance. Cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) in the host cells is responsible for alternative splicing of the M2 gene of influenza virus during influenza infection and replication. In this study, we carried out baculovirus-mediated expression and purification of CLK1 and established a reliable screening assay for CLK1 inhibitors. After a virtual screening of CLK1 inhibitors was performed, the activities of the selected compounds were evaluated. Finally, several compounds with strong inhibitory activity against CLK1 were discovered and their in vitro anti-influenza virus activities were validated using a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay. The assay results showed that clypearin, corilagin, and pinosylvine were the most potential anti-influenza virus compounds as CLK1 inhibitors among the compounds tested. These findings will provide important information for new drug design and development in influenza treatment, and CLK1 may be a potent drug target for anti-influenza drug screening and discovery.
Relevant: False
Reason: Drug discovery study targeting host protein CLK1 for influenza treatment, no direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Correlation between Virus Replication and Antibody Responses in Macaques following Infection with Pandemic Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection of nonhuman primates is a well-established animal model for studying pathogenesis and for evaluating prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies. However, usually a standard dose is used for the infection, and there is no information on the relation between challenge dose and virus replication or the induction of immune responses. Such information is also very scarce for humans and largely confined to evaluation of attenuated virus strains. Here, we have compared the effect of a commonly used dose (4 × 10(6) 50% tissue culture infective doses) versus a 100-fold-higher dose, administered by intrabronchial installation, to two groups of 6 cynomolgus macaques. Animals infected with the high virus dose showed more fever and had higher peak levels of gamma interferon in the blood. However, virus replication in the trachea was not significantly different between the groups, although in 2 out of 6 animals from the high-dose group it was present at higher levels and for a longer duration. The virus-specific antibody response was not significantly different between the groups. However, antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, virus neutralization, and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers correlated with cumulative virus production in the trachea. In conclusion, using influenza virus infection in cynomolgus macaques as a model, we demonstrated a relationship between the level of virus production upon infection and induction of functional antibody responses against the virus. There is only very limited information on the effect of virus inoculation dose on the level of virus production and the induction of adaptive immune responses in humans or nonhuman primates. We found only a marginal and variable effect of virus dose on virus production in the trachea but a significant effect on body temperature. The induction of functional antibody responses, including virus neutralization titer, hemagglutination inhibition titer, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, correlated with the level of virus replication measured in the trachea. The study reveals a relationship between virus production and functional antibody formation, which could be relevant in defining appropriate criteria for new influenza virus vaccine candidates.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study correlates virus replication levels with antibody responses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes (mutations or genetic variants) to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: An Anti-Influenza Virus Antibody Inhibits Viral Infection by Reducing Nucleus Entry of Influenza Nucleoprotein.
Abstract: To date, four main mechanisms mediating inhibition of influenza infection by anti-hemagglutinin antibodies have been reported. Anti-globular-head-domain antibodies block either influenza virus receptor binding to the host cell or progeny virion release from the host cell. Anti-stem region antibodies hinder the membrane fusion process or induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity to infected cells. In this study we identified a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody (CT302), which does not inhibit both the receptor binding and the membrane fusion process but efficiently reduced the nucleus entry of viral nucleoprotein suggesting a novel inhibition mechanism of viral infection by antibody. This antibody binds to the subtype-H3 hemagglutinin globular head domain of group-2 influenza viruses circulating throughout the population between 1997 and 2007.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the mechanism of antibody inhibition of viral infection without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Hemagglutinin Stalk- and Neuraminidase-Specific Monoclonal Antibodies Protect against Lethal H10N8 Influenza Virus Infection in Mice.
Abstract: Between November 2013 and February 2014, China reported three human cases of H10N8 influenza virus infection in the Jiangxi province, two of which were fatal. Using hybridoma technology, we isolated a panel of H10- and N8-directed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and further characterized the binding reactivity of these antibodies (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to a range of purified virus and recombinant protein substrates. The H10-directed MAbs displayed functional hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization activity, and the N8-directed antibodies displayed functional neuraminidase inhibition (NI) activity against H10N8. Surprisingly, the HI-reactive H10 antibodies, as well as a previously generated, group 2 hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-reactive antibody, demonstrated NI activity against H10N8 and an H10N7 strain; this phenomenon was absent when virus was treated with detergent, suggesting the anti-HA antibodies inhibited neuraminidase enzymatic activity through steric hindrance. We tested the prophylactic efficacy of one representative H10-reactive, N8-reactive, and group 2 HA stalk-reactive antibody in vivo using a BALB/c challenge model. All three antibodies were protective at a high dose (5 mg/kg). At a low dose (0.5 mg/kg), only the anti-N8 antibody prevented weight loss. Together, these data suggest that antibody targets other than the globular head domain of the HA may be efficacious in preventing influenza virus-induced morbidity and mortality. Avian H10N8 and H10N7 viruses have recently crossed the species barrier, causing morbidity and mortality in humans and other mammals. Although these reports are likely isolated incidents, it is possible that more cases may emerge in future winter seasons, similar to H7N9. Furthermore, regular transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans increases the risk of adaptive mutations and reassortment events, which may result in a novel virus with pandemic potential. Currently, no specific therapeutics or vaccines are available against the H10N8 influenza virus subtype. We generated a panel of H10- and N8-reactive MAbs. Although these antibodies may practically be developed into therapeutic agents, characterizing the protective potential of MAbs that have targets other than the HA globular head domain will provide insight into novel antibody-mediated mechanisms of protection and help to better understand correlates of protection for influenza A virus infection.

Title: Association analyses of large-scale glycan microarray data reveal novel host-specific substructures in influenza A virus binding glycans.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses can infect a wide variety of animal species and, occasionally, humans. Infection occurs through the binding formed by viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin and certain types of glycan receptors on host cell membranes. Studies have shown that the α2,3-linked sialic acid motif (SA2,3Gal) in avian, equine, and canine species; the α2,6-linked sialic acid motif (SA2,6Gal) in humans; and SA2,3Gal and SA2,6Gal in swine are responsible for the corresponding host tropisms. However, more detailed and refined substructures that determine host tropisms are still not clear. Thus, in this study, we applied association mining on a set of glycan microarray data for 211 influenza viruses from five host groups: humans, swine, canine, migratory waterfowl, and terrestrial birds. The results suggest that besides Neu5Acα2-6Galβ, human-origin viruses could bind glycans with Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Ac and Neu5Gcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc substructures; Galβ and GlcNAcβ terminal substructures, without sialic acid branches, were associated with the binding of human-, swine-, and avian-origin viruses; sulfated Neu5Acα2-3 substructures were associated with the binding of human- and swine-origin viruses. Finally, through three-dimensional structure characterization, we revealed that the role of glycan chain shapes is more important than that of torsion angles or of overall structural similarities in virus host tropisms.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes glycan binding specificities of influenza viruses from different hosts but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Regulatory T Cells Are Critical for Clearing Influenza A Virus in Neonatal Mice.
Abstract: We previously reported that neonatal mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV) develop interstitial pneumonia characterized by reduced lung cytokine and chemokine responses. The failure of T cells to infiltrate the airways of neonates correlated with delayed clearance of sublethal IAV infections compared to adults. We hypothesized that negative regulators in the neonatal lungs such as cytokines or T regulatory (Treg) cells are responsible for these differences. Neonates either deficient in interleukin-10 (IL-10) or with T cells unresponsive to transforming growth factor-β signaling due to absence of SMAD family member 4 (Smad4) had similar IAV clearance kinetics to wild-type pups and no difference in T-cell responses. In contrast, functional depletion of Treg cells with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody resulted in increased proportions of activated CD4(+) T cells in the lungs, but failure to clear IAV. Similarly, scurfy pups (mutation in forkhead box P3 [Foxp3] rendering them deficient in Treg cells) had increased proportions of activated T cells in the lungs compared to littermate controls. Scurfy pups also had increased proportions of IL-13-producing CD4(+) T cells. Interestingly, like anti-CD25-treated pups, scurfy pups had significantly elevated viral loads compared to controls. Based on these data, we conclude that Tregs are critical for clearance of IAV in neonatal mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of regulatory T cells in viral clearance without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Robust expression of vault RNAs induced by influenza A virus plays a critical role in suppression of PKR-mediated innate immunity.
Abstract: Protein kinase R (PKR) is a vital component of host innate immunity against viral infection. However, the mechanism underlying inactivation of PKR by inﬂuenza A virus (IAV) remains elusive. Here, we found that vault RNAs (vtRNAs) were greatly induced in A549 cells and mouse lungs after infection with IAV. The viral NS1 protein was shown to be the inducer triggering the upregulation of vtRNAs. Importantly, silencing vtRNA in A549 cells significantly inhibited IAV replication, whereas overexpression of vtRNAs markedly promoted the viral replication. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that disrupting vtRNA expression in mice significantly decreased IAV replication in infected lungs. The vtRNA knockdown animals exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to IAV infection, as evidenced by attenuated acute lung injury and spleen atrophy and consequently increased survival rates. Interestingly, vtRNAs promoted viral replication through repressing the activation of PKR and the subsequent antiviral interferon response. In addition, increased expression of vtRNAs was required for efficient suppression of PKR by NS1 during IAV infection. Moreover, vtRNAs were also significantly upregulated by infections of several other viruses and involved in the inactivation of PKR signaling by these viruses. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which some viruses circumvent PKR-mediated innate immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host innate immunity mechanisms and viral suppression of PKR without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Conserved Secondary Structural Element in the Coding Region of the Influenza A Virus Nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA Is Important for the Regulation of Viral Proliferation.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a threat to humans due to seasonal epidemics and infrequent, but dangerous, pandemics that lead to widespread infection and death. Eight segments of RNA constitute the genome of this virus and they encode greater than eight proteins via alternative splicing of coding (+)RNAs generated from the genomic (-)RNA template strand. RNA is essential in its life cycle. A bioinformatics analysis of segment 5, which encodes nucleoprotein, revealed a conserved structural motif in the (+)RNA. The secondary structure proposed by energy minimization and comparative analysis agrees with structure predicted based on experimental data using a 121 nucleotide in vitro RNA construct comprising an influenza A virus consensus sequence and also an entire segment 5 (+)RNA (strain A/VietNam/1203/2004 (H5N1)). The conserved motif consists of three hairpins with one being especially thermodynamically stable. The biological importance of this conserved secondary structure is supported in experiments using antisense oligonucleotides in cell line, which found that disruption of this motif led to inhibition of viral fitness. These results suggest that this conserved motif in the segment 5 (+)RNA might be a candidate for oligonucleotide-based antiviral therapy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies a conserved RNA secondary structure important for viral proliferation but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The C-type Lectin Langerin Functions as a Receptor for Attachment and Infectious Entry of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: It is well established that influenza A virus (IAV) attachment to and infection of epithelial cells is dependent on sialic acid (SIA) at the cell surface, although the specific receptors that mediate IAV entry have not been defined and multiple receptors may exist. Lec2 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are SIA deficient and resistant to IAV infection. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the C-type lectin receptor langerin in Lec2 cells (Lec2-Lg) rendered them permissive to IAV infection, as measured by replication of the viral genome, transcription of viral mRNA, and synthesis of viral proteins. Unlike SIA-dependent infection of parental CHO cells, IAV attachment and infection of Lec2-Lg cells was mediated via lectin-mediated recognition of mannose-rich glycans expressed by the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Lec2 cells expressing endocytosis-defective langerin bound IAV efficiently but remained resistant to IAV infection, confirming that internalization via langerin was essential for infectious entry. Langerin-mediated infection of Lec2-Lg cells was pH and dynamin dependent, occurred via clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways, and utilized early (Rab5(+)) but not late (Rab7(+)) endosomes. This study is the first to demonstrate that langerin represents an authentic receptor that binds and internalizes IAV to facilitate infection. Moreover, it describes a unique experimental system to probe specific pathways and compartments involved in infectious entry following recognition of IAV by a single cell surface receptor. On the surface of host cells, sialic acid (SIA) functions as the major attachment factor for influenza A viruses (IAV). However, few studies have identified specific transmembrane receptors that bind and internalize IAV to facilitate infection. Here we identify human langerin as a transmembrane glycoprotein that can act as an attachment factor and a bone fide endocytic receptor for IAV infection. Expression of langerin by an SIA-deficient cell line resistant to IAV rendered cells permissive to infection. As langerin represented the sole receptor for IAV infection in this system, we have defined the pathways and compartments involved in infectious entry of IAV into cells following recognition by langerin.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a host receptor for viral entry but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Aureonitol, a Fungi-Derived Tetrahydrofuran, Inhibits Influenza Replication by Targeting Its Surface Glycoprotein Hemagglutinin.
Abstract: The influenza virus causes acute respiratory infections, leading to high morbidity and mortality in groups of patients at higher risk. Antiviral drugs represent the first line of defense against influenza, both for seasonal infections and pandemic outbreaks. Two main classes of drugs against influenza are in clinical use: M2-channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors. Nevertheless, because influenza strains that are resistant to these antivirals have been described, the search for novel compounds with different mechanisms of action is necessary. Here, we investigated the anti-influenza activity of a fungi-derived natural product, aureonitol. This compound inhibited influenza A and B virus replication. This compound was more effective against influenza A(H3N2), with an EC50 of 100 nM. Aureonitol cytoxicity was also very low, with a CC50 value of 1426 μM. Aureonitol inhibited influenza hemagglutination and, consequently, significantly impaired virus adsorption. Molecular modeling studies revealed that aureonitol docked in the sialic acid binding site of hemagglutinin, forming hydrogen bonds with highly conserved residues. Altogether, our results indicate that the chemical structure of aureonitol is promising for future anti-influenza drug design.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the antiviral activity of a compound targeting hemagglutinin but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus pathogenicity regulated by host cellular proteases, cytokines and metabolites, and its therapeutic options.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality. The knowledge gained within the last decade on the pandemic IAV(H1N1)2009 improved our understanding not only of the viral pathogenicity but also the host cellular factors involved in the pathogenicity of multiorgan failure (MOF), such as cellular trypsin-type hemagglutinin (HA0) processing proteases for viral multiplication, cytokine storm, metabolic disorders and energy crisis. The HA processing proteases in the airway and organs for all IAV known to date have been identified. Recently, a new concept on the pathogenicity of MOF, the "influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin" cycle, has been proposed involving up-regulation of trypsin through pro-inflammatory cytokines, and potentiation of viral multiplication in various organs. Furthermore, the relationship between causative factors has been summarized as the "influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin" cycle interconnected with the "metabolic disorders-cytokine" cycle. These cycles provide new treatment concepts for ATP crisis and MOF. This review discusses IAV pathogenicity on cellular proteases, cytokines, metabolites and therapeutic options.

Title: Identification of cellular microRNA-136 as a dual regulator of RIG-I-mediated innate immunity that antagonizes H5N1 IAV replication in A549 cells.
Abstract: H5N1 influenza A virus (IAV) causes severe respiratory diseases and high mortality rates in animals and humans. MicroRNAs are being increasingly studied to evaluate their potential as therapeutic entities to combat viral infection. However, mechanistic studies delineating the roles of microRNAs in regulating host-H5N1 virus interactions remain scarce. Here, we performed microRNA microarray analysis using A549 human lung epithelial cells infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. The microRNA expression profile of infected cells identified a small number of microRNAs being dysregulated upon H5N1 influenza A virus infection. Of the differentially expressed microRNAs, miR-136 was up-regulated 5-fold and exhibited potent antiviral activity in vitro against H5N1 influenza A virus, as well as vesicular stomatitis virus. On the one hand, 3'-untranslated region (UTR) reporter analysis revealed a miR-136 binding site in the 3' UTR of IL-6. However, on the other hand, we subsequently determined that miR-136 meanwhile acts as an immune agonist of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), thereby causing IL-6 and IFN-β accumulation in A549 cells. Overall, this study implicates the dual role of miRNA-136 in the regulation of host antiviral innate immunity and suggests an important role for the microRNA-activated pathway in viral infection via pattern recognition receptors.

Title: Mismatches in the Influenza A Virus RNA Panhandle Prevent Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) Sensing by Impairing RNA/RIG-I Complex Formation.
Abstract: Influenza virus RNA (vRNA) promoter panhandle structures are believed to be sensed by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). The occurrence of mismatches in this double-stranded RNA structure raises questions about their effect on innate sensing. Our results suggest that mismatches in vRNA promoters decrease binding to RIG-I in vivo, affecting RNA/RIG-I complex formation and preventing RIG-I activation. These results can be inferred to apply to other viruses and suggest that mismatches may represent a general viral strategy to escape RIG-I sensing.

Reason: The paper focuses on how mismatches in the influenza A virus RNA panhandle affect RIG-I sensing, which is a host immune response mechanism, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 modulates the innate immune response to influenza infection but is not required for development of influenza-induced acute lung injury.
Abstract: Extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides are important signaling molecules in the lung. Nucleotide and nucleoside concentrations in alveolar lining fluid are controlled by a complex network of surface ectonucleotidases. Previously, we demonstrated that influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus resulted in increased levels of the nucleotide ATP and the nucleoside adenosine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Influenza-induced acute lung injury (ALI) was highly attenuated in A1-adenosine receptor-knockout mice. Because AMP hydrolysis by the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) plays a central role in and is rate-limiting for generation of adenosine in the normal lung, we hypothesized that ALI would be attenuated in C57BL/6-congenic CD73-knockout (CD73-KO) mice. Infection-induced hypoxemia, bradycardia, viral replication, and bronchoconstriction were moderately increased in CD73-KO mice relative to WT controls. However, postinfection weight loss, pulmonary edema, and parenchymal dysfunction were not altered. Treatment of WT mice with the CD73 inhibitor 5'-(α,β-methylene) diphosphate (APCP) also had no effect on infection-induced pulmonary edema but modestly attenuated hypoxemia. BALF from CD73-KO and APCP-treated WT mice contained more IL-6 and CXCL-10/IFN-γ-induced protein 10, less CXCL-1/keratinocyte chemoattractant, and fewer neutrophils than BALF from untreated WT controls. BALF from APCP-treated WT mice also contained fewer alveolar macrophages and more transforming growth factor-β than BALF from untreated WT mice. These results indicate that CD73 is not necessary for development of ALI following influenza A virus infection and suggest that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase may be responsible for increased adenosine generation in the infected lung. However, they do suggest that CD73 has a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role in influenza.
Relevant: False

Title: Fast Dating Using Least-Squares Criteria and Algorithms.
Abstract: Phylogenies provide a useful way to understand the evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such data. However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here, we present very fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related to the Langley-Fitch molecular-clock model. We show that this model is robust to uncorrelated violations of the molecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the close relationships between least-squares and linear algebra. We distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large input trees (>10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and transformed into time-scaled trees. We compare these algorithms to standard methods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley-Fitch method, and BEAST). Using simulated data, we show that their estimation accuracy is similar to that of the most sophisticated methods, while their computing time is much faster. We apply these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results show that these algorithms provide a very fast alternative with results similar to those of other computer programs. These algorithms are implemented in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can be downloaded from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all our data sets and detailed results. An Online Appendix, providing additional algorithm descriptions, tables, and figures can be found in the Supplementary Material available on Dryad at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.968t3.

Title: Gain-of-Function Research and the Relevance to Clinical Practice.
Abstract: The ongoing moratorium on gain-of-function (GOF) research with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn attention to the current debate on these research practices and the potential benefits and risks they present. While much of the discussion has been steered by members of the microbiology and policy communities, additional input from medical practitioners will be highly valuable toward developing a broadly inclusive policy that considers the relative value and harm of GOF research. This review attempts to serve as a primer on the topic for the clinical community by providing a historical context for GOF research, summarizing concerns about its risks, and surveying the medical products that it has yielded.

Title: New influenza A Virus Entry Inhibitors Derived from the Viral Fusion Peptides.
Abstract: Influenza A viral (IAV) fusion peptides are known for their important role in viral-cell fusion process and membrane destabilization potential which are compatible with those of antimicrobial peptides. Thus, by replacing the negatively or neutrally charged residues of FPs with positively charged lysines, we synthesized several potent antimicrobial peptides derived from the fusogenic peptides (FPs) of hemagglutinin glycoproteins (HAs) of IAV. The biological screening identified that in addition to the potent antibacterial activities, these positively charged fusion peptides (pFPs) effectively inhibited the replication of influenza A viruses including oseltamivir-resistant strain. By employing pseudovirus-based entry inhibition assays including H5N1 influenza A virus (IAV), and VSV-G, the mechanism study indicated that the antiviral activity may be associated with the interactions between the HA2 subunit and pFP, of which, the nascent pFP exerted a strong effect to interrupt the conformational changes of HA2, thereby blocking the entry of viruses into host cells. In addition to providing new peptide "entry blockers", these data also demonstrate a useful strategy in designing potent antibacterial agents, as well as effective viral entry inhibitors. It would be meaningful in treatment of bacterial co-infection during influenza pandemic periods, as well as in our current war against those emerging pathogenic microorganisms such as IAV and HIV.

Title: Phylogenetic network analysis as a parsimony optimization problem.
Abstract: Many problems in comparative biology are, or are thought to be, best expressed as phylogenetic "networks" as opposed to trees. In trees, vertices may have only a single parent (ancestor), while networks allow for multiple parent vertices. There are two main interpretive types of networks, "softwired" and "hardwired." The parsimony cost of hardwired networks is based on all changes over all edges, hence must be greater than or equal to the best tree cost contained ("displayed") by the network. This is in contrast to softwired, where each character follows the lowest parsimony cost tree displayed by the network, resulting in costs which are less than or equal to the best display tree. Neither situation is ideal since hard-wired networks are not generally biologically attractive (since individual heritable characters can have more than one parent) and softwired networks can be trivially optimized (containing the best tree for each character). Furthermore, given the alternate cost scenarios of trees and these two flavors of networks, hypothesis testing among these explanatory scenarios is impossible. A network cost adjustment (penalty) is proposed to allow phylogenetic trees and soft-wired phylogenetic networks to compete equally on a parsimony optimality basis. This cost is demonstrated for several real and simulated datasets. In each case, the favored graph representation (tree or network) matched expectation or simulation scenario. The softwired network cost regime proposed here presents a quantitative criterion for an optimality-based search procedure where trees and networks can participate in hypothesis testing simultaneously.

Title: Bayesian Inference Reveals Host-Specific Contributions to the Epidemic Expansion of Influenza A H5N1.
Abstract: Since its first isolation in 1996 in Guangdong, China, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 has circulated in avian hosts for almost two decades and spread to more than 60 countries worldwide. The role of different avian hosts and the domestic-wild bird interface has been critical in shaping the complex HPAIV H5N1 disease ecology, but remains difficult to ascertain. To shed light on the large-scale H5N1 transmission patterns and disentangle the contributions of different avian hosts on the tempo and mode of HPAIV H5N1 dispersal, we apply Bayesian evolutionary inference techniques to comprehensive sets of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene sequences sampled between 1996 and 2011 throughout Asia and Russia. Our analyses demonstrate that the large-scale H5N1 transmission dynamics are structured according to different avian flyways, and that the incursion of the Central Asian flyway specifically was driven by Anatidae hosts coinciding with rapid rate of spread and an epidemic wavefront acceleration. This also resulted in long-distance dispersal that is likely to be explained by wild bird migration. We identify a significant degree of asymmetry in the large-scale transmission dynamics between Anatidae and Phasianidae, with the latter largely representing poultry as an evolutionary sink. A joint analysis of host dynamics and continuous spatial diffusion demonstrates that the rate of viral dispersal and host diffusivity is significantly higher for Anatidae compared with Phasianidae. These findings complement risk modeling studies and satellite tracking of wild birds in demonstrating a continental-scale structuring into areas of H5N1 persistence that are connected through migratory waterfowl.

Title: Distinct germinal center selection at local sites shapes memory B cell response to viral escape.
Abstract: Respiratory influenza virus infection induces cross-reactive memory B cells targeting invariant regions of viral escape mutants. However, cellular events dictating the cross-reactive memory B cell responses remain to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrated that lung-resident memory compartments at the site of infection, rather than those in secondary lymphoid organs, harbor elevated frequencies of cross-reactive B cells that mediate neutralizing antibody responses to viral escape. The elevated cross-reactivity in the lung memory compartments was correlated with high numbers of VH mutations and was dependent on a developmental pathway involving persistent germinal center (GC) responses. The persistent GC responses were focused in the infected lungs in association with prolonged persistence of the viral antigens. Moreover, the persistent lung GCs supported the exaggerated B cell proliferation and clonal selection for cross-reactive repertoires, which served as the predominant sites for the generation of cross-reactive memory progenitors. Thus, we identified the distinct GC selection at local sites as a key cellular event for cross-reactive memory B cell response to viral escape, a finding with important implications for developing broadly protective influenza vaccines.

Title: Optimization of Droplet Digital PCR from RNA and DNA extracts with direct comparison to RT-qPCR: Clinical implications for quantification of Oseltamivir-resistant subpopulations.
Abstract: The recent introduction of Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) has provided researchers with a tool that permits direct quantification of nucleic acids from a wide range of samples with increased precision and sensitivity versus RT-qPCR. The sample interdependence of RT-qPCR stemming from the measurement of Cq and ΔCq values is eliminated with ddPCR which provides an independent measure of the absolute nucleic acid concentration for each sample without standard curves thereby reducing inter-well and inter-plate variability. Well-characterized RNA purified from H275-wild type (WT) and H275Y-point mutated (MUT) neuraminidase of influenza A (H1N1) pandemic 2009 virus was used to demonstrate a ddPCR optimization workflow to assure robust data for downstream analysis. The ddPCR reaction mix was also tested with RT-qPCR and gave excellent reaction efficiency (between 90% and 100%) with the optimized MUT/WT duplexed assay thus enabling the direct comparison of the two platforms from the same reaction mix and thermal cycling protocol. ddPCR gave a marked improvement in sensitivity (>30-fold) for mutation abundance using a mixture of purified MUT and WT RNA and increased precision (>10 fold, p<0.05 for both inter- and intra-assay variability) versus RT-qPCR from patient samples to accurately identify residual mutant viral population during recovery.

Reason: The paper describes optimization of ddPCR for detecting oseltamivir-resistant viral subpopulations but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics and Global Diversity of Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The increasing number of zoonotic infections caused by influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes of avian origin (e.g., H5N1 and H7N9) in recent years underscores the need to better understand the factors driving IAV evolution and diversity. To evaluate the current feasibility of global analyses to contribute to this aim, we evaluated information in the public domain to explore IAV evolutionary dynamics, including nucleotide substitution rates and selection pressures, using 14 IAV subtypes in 32 different countries over a 12-year period (2000 to 2011). Using geospatial information from 39,785 IAV strains, we examined associations between subtype diversity and socioeconomic, biodiversity, and agricultural indices. Our analyses showed that nucleotide substitution rates for 11 of the 14 evaluated subtypes tended to be higher in Asian countries, particularly in East Asia, than in Canada and the United States. Similarly, at a regional level, subtypes H5N1, H5N2, and H6N2 exhibited significantly higher substitution rates in East Asia than in North America. In contrast, the selection pressures (measured as ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary changes [dN/dS ratios]) acting on individual subtypes showed little geographic variation. We found that the strongest predictors for the detected subtype diversity at the country level were reporting effort (i.e., total number of strains reported) and health care spending (an indicator of economic development). Our analyses also identified major global gaps in IAV reporting (including a lack of sequences submitted from large portions of Africa and South America and a lack of geolocation information) and in broad subtype testing which, until addressed, will continue to hinder efforts to track the evolution and diversity of IAV around the world. In recent years, an increasing number of influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, including H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8, have been detected in humans. High fatality rates have led to an increased urgency to better understand where and how novel pathogenic influenza virus strains emerge. Our findings showed that mutational rates of 11 commonly encountered subtypes were higher in East Asian countries than in North America, suggesting that there may be a greater risk for the emergence of novel pathogenic strains in East Asia. In assessing the potential drivers of IAV subtype diversity, our analyses confirmed that reporting effort and health care spending were the best predictors of the observed subtype diversity at the country level. These findings underscore the need to increase sampling and reporting efforts for all subtypes in many undersampled countries throughout the world.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes evolutionary dynamics and global diversity of influenza A virus subtypes but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Nucleolar Protein, Ribosomal RNA Processing 1 Homolog B (RRP1B), Enhances the Recruitment of Cellular mRNA in Influenza Virus Transcription.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) undergoes RNA transcription by a unique capped-mRNA-dependent transcription, which is carried out by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), consisting of the viral PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins. However, how the viral RdRp utilizes cellular factors for virus transcription is not clear. Previously, we conducted a genome-wide pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen to identify host factors important for influenza A virus replication. Ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B (RRP1B) was identified as one of the candidates. RRP1B is a nucleolar protein involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Upon IAV infection, part of RRP1B was translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where viral RNA synthesis likely takes place. The depletion of RRP1B significantly reduced IAV mRNA transcription in a minireplicon assay and in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, we showed that RRP1B interacted with PB1 and PB2 of the RdRp and formed a coimmunoprecipitable complex with RdRp. The depletion of RRP1B reduced the amount of capped mRNA in the RdRp complex. Taken together, these findings indicate that RRP1B is a host factor essential for IAV transcription and provide a target for new antivirals. Influenza virus is an important human pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality and threatens the human population with epidemics and pandemics every year. Due to the high mutation rate of the virus, antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins might ultimately lose their effectiveness. An alternative strategy that explores the genetic stability of host factors indispensable for influenza virus replication would thus be desirable. Here, we characterized the rRNA processing 1 homolog B (RRP1B) protein as an important cellular factor for influenza A virus transcription. We showed that silencing RRP1B hampered viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, which is responsible for virus transcription and replication. Furthermore, we reported that RRP1B is crucial for RdRp binding to cellular capped mRNA, which is a critical step of virus transcription. Our study not only provides a deeper understanding of influenza virus-host interplay, but also suggests a potential target for antiviral drug development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a host nucleolar protein's role in influenza virus transcription, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Replication-Competent Influenza Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Luciferase Reporter Strains Engineered for Co-Infections Identify Antiviral Compounds in Combination Screens.
Abstract: Myxoviruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major human pathogens, mandating the development of novel therapeutics. To establish a high-throughput screening protocol for the simultaneous identification of pathogen- and host-targeted hit candidates against either pathogen or both, we have attempted co-infection of cells with IAV and RSV. However, viral replication kinetics were incompatible, RSV signal window was low, and an IAV-driven minireplicon reporter assay used in initial screens narrowed the host cell range and restricted the assay to single-cycle infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an RSV strain carrying firefly luciferase fused to an innovative universal small-molecule assisted shut-off domain, which boosted assay signal window, and a hyperactive fusion protein that synchronized IAV and RSV reporter expression kinetics and suppressed the identification of RSV entry inhibitors sensitive to a recently reported RSV pan-resistance mechanism. Combined with a replication-competent recombinant IAV strain harboring nanoluciferase, the assay performed well on a human respiratory cell line and supports multicycle infections. Miniaturized to 384-well format, the protocol was validated through screening of a set of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection (NCC) in quadruplicate. These test screens demonstrated favorable assay parameters and reproducibility. Application to a LOPAC library of bioactive compounds in a proof-of-concept campaign detected licensed antimyxovirus therapeutics, ribavirin and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, and identified two unexpected RSV-specific hit candidates, Fenretinide and the opioid receptor antagonist BNTX-7. Hits were evaluated in direct and orthogonal dose-response counterscreens using a standard recRSV reporter strain expressing Renilla luciferase.

Title: Full-length trimeric influenza virus hemagglutinin II membrane fusion protein and shorter constructs lacking the fusion peptide or transmembrane domain: Hyperthermostability of the full-length protein and the soluble ectodomain and fusion peptide make significant contributions to fusion of membrane vesicles.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a class I enveloped virus which is initially endocytosed into a host respiratory epithelial cell. Subsequent reduction of the pH to the 5-6 range triggers a structural change of the viral hemagglutinin II (HA2) protein, fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, and release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. HA2 contains fusion peptide (FP), soluble ectodomain (SE), transmembrane (TM), and intraviral domains with respective lengths of ∼ 25, ∼ 160, ∼ 25, and ∼ 10 residues. The present work provides a straightforward protocol for producing and purifying mg quantities of full-length HA2 from expression in bacteria. Biophysical and structural comparisons are made between full-length HA2 and shorter constructs including SHA2 ≡ SE, FHA2 ≡ FP+SE, and SHA2-TM ≡ SE+TM constructs. The constructs are helical in detergent at pH 7.4 and the dominant trimer species. The proteins are highly thermostable in decylmaltoside detergent with Tm>90 °C for HA2 with stabilization provided by the SE, FP, and TM domains. The proteins are likely in a trimer-of-hairpins structure, the final protein state during fusion. All constructs induce fusion of negatively-charged vesicles at pH 5.0 with much less fusion at pH 7.4. Attractive protein/vesicle electrostatics play a role in fusion, as the proteins are positively-charged at pH 5.0 and negatively-charged at pH 7.4 and the pH-dependence of fusion is reversed for positively-charged vesicles. Comparison of fusion between constructs supports significant contributions to fusion from the SE and the FP with little effect from the TM.

Title: Challenges and Strategies of Laboratory Diagnosis for Newly Emerging Influenza Viruses in Taiwan: A Decade after SARS.
Abstract: Since the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan was identified in March 2003, viral respiratory infections, in particular the influenza virus, have become a national public health concern. Taiwan would face a serious threat of public health problems if another SARS epidemic overlapped with a flu outbreak. After SARS, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control accelerated and strengthened domestic research on influenza and expanded the exchange of information with international counterparts. The capacity of influenza A to cross species barriers presents a potential threat to human health. Given the mutations of avian flu viruses such as H7N9, H6N1, and H10N8, all countries, including Taiwan, must equip themselves to face a possible epidemic or pandemic. Such preparedness requires global collaboration.

Abstract: Influenza A(H3N2) virus was detected in oral fluid from 16/107 children (aged 2 to 12 years) with a clinical diagnosis of mumps, who were sampled between December 2014 and February 2015 in England, during the peak of the 2014/15 influenza season. Sequence analysis of an A(H3N2) virus from a child with suspected mumps showed the virus was similar to other circulating A(H3N2) viruses detected in winter 2014/15, which were antigenically drifted from the A(H3N2) vaccine strain.

Title: The Reemergent 1977 H1N1 Strain and the Gain-of-Function Debate.
Abstract: The 1977-1978 influenza epidemic was probably not a natural event, as the genetic sequence of the virus was nearly identical to the sequences of decades-old strains. While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.
Relevant: False

Title: Emerging Infections of CNS: Avian Influenza A Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus and Human Parechovirus.
Abstract: History is replete with emergent pandemic infections that have decimated the human population. Given the shear mass of humans that now crowd the earth, there is every reason to suspect history will repeat itself. We describe three RNA viruses that have recently emerged in the human population to mediate severe neurological disease. These new diseases are results of new mutations in the infectious agents or new exposure pathways to the agents or both. To appreciate their pathogenesis, we summarize the essential virology and immune response to each agent. Infection is described in the context of known host defenses. Once the viruses evade immune defenses and enter central nervous system (CNS) cells, they rapidly co-opt host RNA processing to a cataclysmic extent. It is not clear why the brain is particularly susceptible to RNA viruses; but perhaps because of its tremendous dependence on RNA processing for physiological functioning, classical mechanisms of host defense (eg, interferon disruption of viral replication) are diminished or not available. Effectiveness of immunity, immunization and pharmacological therapies is reviewed to contextualize the scope of the public health challenge. Unfortunately, vaccines that confer protection from systemic disease do not necessarily confer protection for the brain after exposure through unconventional routes.

Title: New Routes to Phylogeography: A Bayesian Structured Coalescent Approximation.
Abstract: Phylogeographic methods aim to infer migration trends and the history of sampled lineages from genetic data. Applications of phylogeography are broad, and in the context of pathogens include the reconstruction of transmission histories and the origin and emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference based on bottom-up population genetics models is computationally expensive, and as a result faster alternatives based on the evolution of discrete traits have become popular. In this paper, we show that inference of migration rates and root locations based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA (BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent with the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few populations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers that successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled non-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly concludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an increasingly prominent role informing the control and prevention of infectious diseases, it will be vital that phylogeographic inference provides robust insights into transmission history.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogeographic methods and transmission history inference without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Lamprey VLRB response to influenza virus supports universal rules of immunogenicity and antigenicity.
Abstract: Immunoglobulins (Igs) are a crown jewel of jawed vertebrate evolution. Through recombination and mutation of small numbers of genes, Igs can specifically recognize a vast variety of natural and man-made organic molecules. Jawless vertebrates evolved a parallel system of humoral immunity, which recognizes antigens not with Ig, but with a structurally unrelated receptor called the variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB). We exploited the convergent evolution of Ig and VLRB antibodies (Abs) to investigate if intrinsic chemical features of foreign proteins determine their antigenicity and immunogenicity. Surprisingly, we find lamprey VLRB and mouse Ig responses to influenza A virus are extremely similar. Each focuses ~80% of the response on hemagglutinin (HA), mainly through recognition of the major antigenic sites in the HA globular head domain. Our findings predict basic conservation of Ab responses to protein antigens, strongly supporting the use of animal models for understanding human Ab responses to viruses and protein immunogens.

Title: SNPGenie: estimating evolutionary parameters to detect natural selection using pooled next-generation sequencing data.
Abstract: New applications of next-generation sequencing technologies use pools of DNA from multiple individuals to estimate population genetic parameters. However, no publicly available tools exist to analyse single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling results directly for evolutionary parameters important in detecting natural selection, including nucleotide diversity and gene diversity. We have developed SNPGenie to fill this gap. The user submits a FASTA reference sequence(s), a Gene Transfer Format (.GTF) file with CDS information and a SNP report(s) in an increasing selection of formats. The program estimates nucleotide diversity, distance from the reference and gene diversity. Sites are flagged for multiple overlapping reading frames, and are categorized by polymorphism type: nonsynonymous, synonymous, or ambiguous. The results allow single nucleotide, single codon, sliding window, whole gene and whole genome/population analyses that aid in the detection of positive and purifying natural selection in the source population. SNPGenie version 1.2 is a Perl program with no additional dependencies. It is free, open-source, and available for download at https://github.com/hugheslab/snpgenie. nelsoncw@email.sc.edu or austin@biol.sc.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Title: The Cellular Factor NXP2/MORC3 Is a Positive Regulator of Influenza Virus Multiplication.
Abstract: Transcription and replication of influenza A virus are carried out in the nuclei of infected cells in the context of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The viral polymerase responsible for these processes is a protein complex composed of the PB1, PB2, and PA proteins. We previously identified a set of polymerase-associated cellular proteins by proteomic analysis of polymerase-containing intracellular complexes expressed and purified from human cells. Here we characterize the role of NXP2/MORC3 in the infection cycle. NXP2/MORC3 is a member of the Microrchidia (MORC) family that is associated with the nuclear matrix and has RNA-binding activity. Influenza virus infection led to a slight increase in NXP2/MORC3 expression and its partial relocalization to the cytoplasm. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments indicated an association of NXP2/MORC3 with the viral polymerase and RNPs during infection. Downregulation of NXP2/MORC3 by use of two independent short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) reduced virus titers in low-multiplicity infections. Consistent with these findings, analysis of virus-specific RNA in high-multiplicity infections indicated a reduction of viral RNA (vRNA) and mRNA after NXP2/MORC3 downregulation. Silencing of NXP2/MORC3 in a recombinant minireplicon system in which virus transcription and replication are uncoupled showed reductions in cat mRNA and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) protein accumulation but no alterations in cat vRNA levels, suggesting that NXP2/MORC3 is important for influenza virus transcription. Influenza virus infections appear as yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory disease, with high morbidity and occasional mortality. Influenza viruses are intracellular parasites that replicate and transcribe their genomic ribonucleoproteins in the nuclei of infected cells, in a complex interplay with host cell factors. Here we characterized the role of the human NXP2/MORC3 protein, a member of the Microrchidia family that is associated with the nuclear matrix, during virus infection. NXP2/MORC3 associates with the viral ribonucleoproteins in infected cells. Downregulation of NXP2/MORC3 reduced virus titers and accumulations of viral genomic RNA and mRNAs. Silencing of NXP2/MORC3 in an influenza virus CAT minireplicon system diminished CAT protein and cat mRNA levels but not genomic RNA levels. We propose that NXP2/MORC3 plays a role in influenza virus transcription.

Title: Establishment of a High-Throughput Assay to Monitor Influenza A Virus RNA Transcription and Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses significant threats to public health because of the recent emergence of highly pathogenic strains and wide-spread resistance to available anti-influenza drugs. Therefore, new antiviral targets and new drugs to fight influenza virus infections are needed. Although IAV RNA transcription/replication represents a promising target for antiviral drug development, no assay ideal for high-throughput screening (HTS) application is currently available to identify inhibitors targeting these processes. In this work, we developed a novel HTS assay to analyze the transcription and replication of IAV RNA using an A549 cell line stably expressing IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, NP and a viral mini-genomic RNA. Both secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and blasticidin resistance gene (Bsd) were encoded in the viral minigenome and expressed under the control of IAV RdRp. Gluc serves as a reporter to monitor the activity of IAV RdRp, and Bsd is used to maintain the expression of all foreign genes. Biochemical studies and the statistical analysis presented herein demonstrate the high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay. This work provides an ideal HTS assay for the identification of inhibitors targeting the function of IAV RdRp and a convenient reporting system for mechanism study of IAV RNA transcription / replication.

Title: Repurposing Kinase Inhibitors as Antiviral Agents to Control Influenza A Virus Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes seasonal epidemics of contagious respiratory illness that causes substantial morbidity and some mortality. Regular vaccination is the principal strategy for controlling influenza virus, although vaccine efficacy is variable. IAV antiviral drugs are available; however, substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently FDA-approved antiviral drugs. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are being sought to reduce the burden of influenza-related disease. A high-throughput screen using a human kinase inhibitor library was performed targeting an emerging IAV strain (H7N9) in A549 cells. The inhibitor library contained 273 structurally diverse, active cell permeable kinase inhibitors with known bioactivity and safety profiles, many of which are at advanced stages of clinical development. The current study shows that treatment of human A549 cells with kinase inhibitors dinaciclib, flavopiridol, or PIK-75 exhibits potent antiviral activity against H7N9 IAV as well as other IAV strains. Thus, targeting host kinases can provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach against IAV. These findings provide a path forward for repurposing existing kinase inhibitors safely as potential antivirals, particularly those that can be tested in vivo and ultimately for clinical use.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on repurposing kinase inhibitors as antiviral agents targeting host factors, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance of Influenza A Virus and Its Subtypes in Migratory Wild Birds of Nepal.
Abstract: Nepal boarders India and China and all three countries lie within the Central Asian Flyway for migratory birds. Novel influenza A H7N9 caused human fatalities in China in 2013. Subclinical infections of influenza A H7N9 in birds and the potential for virus dispersal by migratory birds prompted this study to assess avian H7N9 viral intrusion into Nepal. Surveillance of influenza A virus in migratory birds was implemented in early 2014 with assistance from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Of 1811 environmental fecal samples collected from seven wetland migratory bird roosting areas, influenza A H9N2 was found in one sample from a ruddy shelduck in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve located in southern Nepal. Avian H7N9 and other highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were not detected. This study provides baseline data on the status of avian influenza virus in migratory bird populations in Nepal.

Title: New Metrics for Evaluating Viral Respiratory Pathogenesis.
Abstract: Viral pathogenesis studies in mice have relied on markers of severe systemic disease, rather than clinically relevant measures, to evaluate respiratory virus infection; thus confounding connections to human disease. Here, whole-body plethysmography was used to directly measure changes in pulmonary function during two respiratory viral infections. This methodology closely tracked with traditional pathogenesis metrics, distinguished both virus- and dose-specific responses, and identified long-term respiratory changes following both SARS-CoV and Influenza A Virus infection. Together, the work highlights the utility of examining respiratory function following infection in order to fully understand viral pathogenesis.

Title: Urokinase receptor-deficient mice mount an innate immune response to and clarify respiratory viruses as efficiently as wild-type mice.
Abstract: The plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is required for lung infiltration by innate immune cells in respiratory bacterial infections. In order to verify if this held true for respiratory viruses, wild type (WT) and uPAR knockout (uPAR(-/-)) mice were inoculated intranasally with the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and the influenza A virus. At several days post-infection (dpi), viral titers in the lungs were determined while cell infiltrates in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were analyzed by flow cytometry. In the case of influenza A, body weight loss and mortality were also monitored. Only minor differences were observed between infected WT and uPAR(-/-) mice, primarily in influenza virus replication and pathology. These results indicate that uPAR does not play a major role in limiting virus replication or in orchestrating the innate immune response against HRSV or influenza infections in mice. This suggests that there are fundamental differences in the immune control of the viral infections studied here and those caused by bacteria.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares innate immune responses in urokinase receptor-deficient and wild-type mice infected with respiratory viruses, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Abundance and specificity of influenza reactive circulating memory follicular helper and non-follicular helper CD4 T cells in healthy adults.
Abstract: CD4 T-cell responses are functionally complex and regulate many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. Follicular helper (Tfh) cells are CD4 T cells specialized to support B-cell production of isotype-switched, high-affinity antibody. So far, studies of Tfh cells in humans have focused on their differentiation requirements, with little research devoted to their antigen specificity. Here, after separating circulating human memory CD4 T cells based on expression of CXCR5, a signature marker of Tfh, we have quantified and assayed the influenza protein antigen specificity of blood Tfh cells and CD4 T cells lacking this marker. Through the use of peptide pools derived from nucleoprotein (NP) or haemagglutinin (HA) and a panel of human donors, we have discovered that circulating Tfh cells preferentially recognize peptide epitopes from HA while cells lacking CXCR5 are enriched for specificity toward NP. These studies suggest that reactive CD4 T cells specific for distinct viral antigens may have generalized differences in their functional potential due to their previous stimulation history.

Title: Low expression of activation marker CD69 and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 on memory T cells after 2009 H1N1 influenza A antigen stimulation in vitro following H1N1 vaccination of HIV-infected individuals.
Abstract: Unlike well-studied antibody responses to pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus vaccines in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) individuals, less well understood are cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to this antigen in this susceptible population. We investigated such influenza-specific CMI responses in 61 HIV+ individuals and in 20 HIV-negative (HIV-) healthy controls. Each was vaccinated with a single licensed dose of inactivated, split-virion vaccine comprised of the influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus-like strain. Cells collected just prior to vaccination and at 1 and 3 months afterwards were stimulated in vitro with dialyzed vaccine antigen and assayed by flow cytometry for cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-10, for degranulation marker CD107a, as well as phenotypes of memory T-cell subpopulations. Comparable increases of cytokine-producing and CD107a-expressing T cells were observed in both HIV+ subjects and healthy HIV-controls. However, by 3 months post-vaccination, in vitro antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced greater expansion in controls of both CD4 and CD8 central memory and effector memory T cells, as well as higher expression of the activation marker CD69 and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 than in HIV+ subjects. We concluded CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells produce cytokines at comparable levels in both groups, whereas the expression after in vitro stimulation of molecules critical for cell migration to infection sites are lower in the HIV+ than in comparable controls. Further immunization strategies against influenza are needed to improve the CMI responses in people living with HIV.

Title: The Role of Human Transportation Networks in Mediating the Genetic Structure of Seasonal Influenza in the United States.
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for human mobility networks when modeling epidemics in order to accurately predict spatial dynamics. However, little is known about the impact these movement networks have on the genetic structure of pathogen populations and whether these effects are scale-dependent. We investigated how human movement along the aviation and commuter networks contributed to intra-seasonal genetic structure of influenza A epidemics in the continental United States using spatially-referenced hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences collected from 2003-2013 for both the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes. Comparative analysis of these transportation networks revealed that the commuter network is highly spatially-organized and more heavily traveled than the aviation network, which instead is characterized by high connectivity between all state pairs. We found that genetic distance between sequences often correlated with distance based on interstate commuter network connectivity for the H1N1 subtype, and that this correlation was not as prevalent when geographic distance or aviation network connectivity distance was assessed against genetic distance. However, these patterns were not as apparent for the H3N2 subtype at the scale of the continental United States. Finally, although sequences were spatially referenced at the level of the US state of collection, a community analysis based on county to county commuter connections revealed that commuting communities did not consistently align with state geographic boundaries, emphasizing the need for the greater availability of more specific sequence location data. Our results highlight the importance of utilizing host movement data in characterizing the underlying genetic structure of pathogen populations and demonstrate a need for a greater understanding of the differential effects of host movement networks on pathogen transmission at various spatial scales.

Title: High Inter-Individual Diversity of Point Mutations, Insertions, and Deletions in Human Influenza Virus Nucleoprotein-Specific Memory B Cells.
Abstract: The diversity of virus-specific antibodies and of B cells among different individuals is unknown. Using single-cell cloning of antibody genes, we generated recombinant human monoclonal antibodies from influenza nucleoprotein-specific memory B cells in four adult humans with and without preceding influenza vaccination. We examined the diversity of the antibody repertoires and found that NP-specific B cells used numerous immunoglobulin genes. The heavy chains (HCs) originated from 26 and the kappa light chains (LCs) from 19 different germ line genes. Matching HC and LC chains gave rise to 43 genetically distinct antibodies that bound influenza NP. The median lengths of the CDR3 of the HC, kappa and lambda LC were 14, 9 and 11 amino acids, respectively. We identified changes at 13.6% of the amino acid positions in the V gene of the antibody heavy chain, at 8.4% in the kappa and at 10.6 % in the lambda V gene. We identified somatic insertions or deletions in 8.1% of the variable genes. We also found several small groups of clonal relatives that were highly diversified. Our findings demonstrate broadly diverse memory B cell repertoires for the influenza nucleoprotein. We found extensive variation within individuals with a high number of point mutations, insertions, and deletions, and extensive clonal diversification. Thus, structurally conserved proteins can elicit broadly diverse and highly mutated B-cell responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on diversity of antibody repertoires and B cell mutations, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: In Vivo RNAi Screening Identifies MDA5 as a Significant Contributor to the Cellular Defense against Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Responding to an influenza A virus (IAV) infection demands an effective intrinsic cellular defense strategy to slow replication. To identify contributing host factors to this defense, we exploited the host microRNA pathway to perform an in vivo RNAi screen. To this end, IAV, lacking a functional NS1 antagonist, was engineered to encode individual siRNAs against antiviral host genes in an effort to rescue attenuation. This screening platform resulted in the enrichment of strains targeting virus-activated transcription factors, specific antiviral effectors, and intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Interestingly, in addition to RIG-I, the PRR for IAV, a virus with the capacity to silence MDA5 also emerged as a dominant strain in wild-type, but not in MDA5-deficient mice. Transcriptional profiling of infected knockout cells confirmed RIG-I to be the primary PRR for IAV but implicated MDA5 as a significant contributor to the cellular defense against influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host factors contributing to defense against influenza but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiology, Evolution, and Recent Outbreaks of Avian Influenza Virus in China.
Abstract: Novel reassortants of H7N9, H10N8, and H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are currently circulating in China's poultry flocks, occasionally infecting humans and other mammals. Combined with the sometimes enzootic H5N1 and H9N2 strains, this cauldron of genetically diverse AIVs pose significant risks to public health. Here, we review the epidemiology, evolution, and recent outbreaks of AIVs in China, discuss reasons behind the recent increase in the emergence of novel AIVs, and identify warning signs which may point to the emergence of a potentially virulent and highly transmissible AIV to humans. This review will be useful to authorities who consider options for the detection and control of AIV transmission in animals and humans, with the goal of preventing future epidemics and pandemics.

Title: Fatal H5N6 Avian Influenza Virus Infection in a Domestic Cat and Wild Birds in China.
Abstract: H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) may pose a potential human risk as suggested by the first documented naturally-acquired human H5N6 virus infection in 2014. Here, we report the first cases of fatal H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in a domestic cat and wild birds. These cases followed human H5N6 infections in China and preceded an H5N6 outbreak in chickens. The extensive migration routes of wild birds may contribute to the geographic spread of H5N6 AIVs and pose a risk to humans and susceptible domesticated animals, and the H5N6 AIVs may spread from southern China to northern China by wild birds. Additional surveillance is required to better understand the threat of zoonotic transmission of AIVs.

Title: Airway-Resident Memory CD8 T Cells Provide Antigen-Specific Protection against Respiratory Virus Challenge through Rapid IFN-γ Production.
Abstract: CD8 airway resident memory T (TRM) cells are a distinctive TRM population with a high turnover rate and a unique phenotype influenced by their localization within the airways. Their role in mediating protective immunity to respiratory pathogens, although suggested by many studies, has not been directly proven. This study provides definitive evidence that airway CD8 TRM cells are sufficient to mediate protection against respiratory virus challenge. Despite being poorly cytolytic in vivo and failing to expand after encountering Ag, airway CD8 TRM cells rapidly express effector cytokines, with IFN-γ being produced most robustly. Notably, established airway CD8 TRM cells possess the ability to produce IFN-γ faster than systemic effector memory CD8 T cells. Furthermore, naive mice receiving intratracheal transfer of airway CD8 TRM cells lacking the ability to produce IFN-γ were less effective at controlling pathogen load upon heterologous challenge. This direct evidence of airway CD8 TRM cell-mediated protection demonstrates the importance of these cells as a first line of defense for optimal immunity against respiratory pathogens and suggests they should be considered in the development of future cell-mediated vaccines.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on CD8 T cell-mediated protection and cytokine production (host immune phenotype) without explicit links to viral genotypes.

Title: Transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in humans and swine in backyard farms in Tumbes, Peru.
Abstract: We aimed to determine the frequency of pH1N1 transmission between humans and swine on backyard farms in Tumbes, Peru. Two-year serial cross-sectional study comprising four sampling periods: March 2009 (pre-pandemic), October 2009 (peak of the pandemic in Peru), April 2010 (1st post-pandemic period), and October 2011 (2nd post-pandemic period). Backyard swine serum, tracheal swabs, and lung sample were collected during each sampling period. We assessed current and past pH1N1 infection in swine through serological testing, virus culture, and RT-PCR and compared the results with human incidence data from a population-based active surveillance cohort study in Peru. Among 1303 swine sampled, the antibody prevalence to pH1N1 was 0% pre-pandemic, 8% at the peak of the human pandemic (October 2009), and 24% in April 2010 and 1% in October 2011 (post-pandemic sampling periods). Trends in swine seropositivity paralleled those seen in humans in Tumbes. The pH1N1 virus was isolated from three pigs during the peak of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses likely represent two separate human-to-swine transmission events in backyard farm settings. Our findings suggest that human-to-swine pH1N1 transmission occurred during the pandemic among backyard farms in Peru, emphasizing the importance of interspecies transmission in backyard pig populations. Continued surveillance for influenza viruses in backyard farms is warranted.

Title: Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of influenza A virus proteins.
Abstract: Influenza viruses transcribe and replicate their genomes in the nuclei of infected host cells. The viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex of influenza virus is the essential genetic unit of the virus. The viral proteins play important roles in multiple processes, including virus structural maintenance, mediating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the vRNP complex, virus particle assembly, and budding. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of viral proteins occurs throughout the entire virus life cycle. This review mainly focuses on matrix protein (M1), nucleoprotein (NP), nonstructural protein (NS1), and nuclear export protein (NEP), summarizing the mechanisms of their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the regulation of virus replication through their phosphorylation to further understand the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in host adaptation of the viruses.

Title: Influenza A virus on oceanic islands: host and viral diversity in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean.
Abstract: Ducks and seabirds are natural hosts for influenza A viruses (IAV). On oceanic islands, the ecology of IAV could be affected by the relative diversity, abundance and density of seabirds and ducks. Seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the Western Indian Ocean and, in this region, oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential IAV host species. Based on serological assays, we assessed the host range of IAV and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes). We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns. We discuss the role of tern migrations in the spread of viruses to and between oceanic islands, in particular for the H2 and H9 IAV subtypes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses host range and virus subtype diversity in seabirds but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets.
Abstract: The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.

Title: Serological evidence of influenza A viruses in frugivorous bats from Africa.
Abstract: Bats are likely natural hosts for a range of zoonotic viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, Rabies, as well as for various Corona- and Paramyxoviruses. In 2009/10, researchers discovered RNA of two novel influenza virus subtypes--H17N10 and H18N11--in Central and South American fruit bats. The identification of bats as possible additional reservoir for influenza A viruses raises questions about the role of this mammalian taxon in influenza A virus ecology and possible public health relevance. As molecular testing can be limited by a short time window in which the virus is present, serological testing provides information about past infections and virus spread in populations after the virus has been cleared. This study aimed at screening available sera from 100 free-ranging, frugivorous bats (Eidolon helvum) sampled in 2009/10 in Ghana, for the presence of antibodies against the complete panel of influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) types ranging from H1 to H18 by means of a protein microarray platform. This technique enables simultaneous serological testing against multiple recombinant HA-types in 5 μl of serum. Preliminary results indicate serological evidence against avian influenza subtype H9 in about 30% of the animals screened, with low-level cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related subtypes H8 and H12. To our knowledge, this is the first report of serological evidence of influenza A viruses other than H17 and H18 in bats. As avian influenza subtype H9 is associated with human infections, the implications of our findings from a public health context remain to be investigated.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study provides serological evidence of influenza A viruses in bats but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Computational Characterization of Transient Strain-Transcending Immunity against Influenza A.
Abstract: The enigmatic observation that the rapidly evolving influenza A (H3N2) virus exhibits, at any given time, a limited standing genetic diversity has been an impetus for much research. One of the first generative computational models to successfully recapitulate this pattern of consistently constrained diversity posits the existence of a strong and short-lived strain-transcending immunity. Building on that model, we explored a much broader set of scenarios (parameterizations) of a transient strain-transcending immunity, ran long-term simulations of each such scenario, and assessed its plausibility with respect to a set of known or estimated influenza empirical measures. We evaluated simulated outcomes using a variety of measures, both epidemiological (annual attack rate, epidemic duration, reproductive number, and peak weekly incidence), and evolutionary (pairwise antigenic diversity, fixation rate, most recent common ancestor, and kappa, which quantifies the potential for antigenic evolution). Taking cumulative support from all these measures, we show which parameterizations of strain-transcending immunity are plausible with respect to the set of empirically derived target values. We conclude that strain-transcending immunity which is milder and longer lasting than previously suggested is more congruent with the observed short- and long-term behavior of influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a computational modeling study of strain-transcending immunity and influenza epidemiology; it does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus evolution and spatio-temporal dynamics in Eurasian wild birds: a phylogenetic and phylogeographical study of whole-genome sequence data.
Abstract: Low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a natural host reservoir in wild waterbirds and the potential to spread to other host species. Here, we investigated the evolutionary, spatial and temporal dynamics of avian IAVs in Eurasian wild birds. We used whole-genome sequences collected as part of an intensive long-term Eurasian wild bird surveillance study, and combined this genetic data with temporal and spatial information to explore the virus evolutionary dynamics. Frequent reassortment and co-circulating lineages were observed for all eight genomic RNA segments over time. There was no apparent species-specific effect on the diversity of the avian IAVs. There was a spatial and temporal relationship between the Eurasian sequences and significant viral migration of avian IAVs from West Eurasia towards Central Eurasia. The observed viral migration patterns differed between segments. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced when analysing these surveillance and sequence data, and the caveats to be borne in mind when drawing conclusions from the apparent results of such analyses.

Title: Potential recombinant vaccine against influenza A virus based on M2e displayed on nodaviral capsid nanoparticles.
Abstract: Influenza A virus poses a major threat to human health, causing outbreaks from time to time. Currently available vaccines employ inactivated viruses of different strains to provide protection against influenza virus infection. However, high mutation rates of influenza virus hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) glycoproteins give rise to vaccine escape mutants. Thus, an effective vaccine providing protection against all strains of influenza virus would be a valuable asset. The ectodomain of matrix 2 protein (M2e) was found to be highly conserved despite mutations of the H and N glycoproteins. Hence, one to five copies of M2e were fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the recombinant nodavirus capsid protein derived from Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The chimeric proteins harboring up to five copies of M2e formed nanosized virus-like particles approximately 30 nm in diameter, which could be purified easily by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. BALB/c mice immunized subcutaneously with these chimeric proteins developed antibodies specifically against M2e, and the titer was proportional to the copy numbers of M2e displayed on the nodavirus capsid nanoparticles. The fusion proteins also induced a type 1 T helper immune response. Collectively, M2e displayed on the nodavirus capsid nanoparticles could provide an alternative solution to a possible influenza pandemic in the future.

Reason: The paper focuses on vaccine development using conserved M2e protein but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Respiratory viruses and torque teno virus in adults with acute respiratory infections.
Abstract: To define the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in adult patients. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from all adult patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), or severe ARI (SARI) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia, between March 2010 and April 2011 and analyzed for 19 respiratory viruses and for torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV). Respiratory viruses were detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes A1 and A2, the influenza B virus, human adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively. This study highlights the need to perform routine detection of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalized with ARI, asthma exacerbation, and/or pneumonia.

Title: Avian influenza H9N2 seroprevalence among pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, China.
Abstract: Shandong province of China has a large number of pig farms with the semi-enclosed houses, allowing crowds of wild birds to seek food in the pig houses. As the carriers of avian influenza virus (AIV), these wild birds can easily pass the viruses to the pigs and even the occupational swine-exposed workers. However, thus far, serological investigation concerning H9N2 AIV in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong is sparse. To better understand the prevalence of H9N2 AIV in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, the serum samples of pigs and occupational pig-exposed workers were collected and tested for the antibodies for H9N2 AIV by both hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and micro-neutralization (MN) assays. When using the antibody titers ≥40 as cut-off value, 106 (HI: 106/2176, 4.87%) and 84 (MN: 84/2176, 3.86%) serum samples of pigs were tested positive, respectively; 6 (HI: 6/287, 2.09%) and 4 (MN: 4/287, 1.39%) serum samples of the pig farm staff were positive, respectively; however, serum samples from the control humans were tested negative in both HI and MN assays. These findings revealed that there were H9N2 AIV infections in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, China. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to conduct the long-term surveillance of AIV in pig population and the pig farm staff.

Title: Timing Is Everything: Coordinated Control of Host Shutoff by Influenza A Virus NS1 and PA-X Proteins.
Abstract: Like all viruses, influenza viruses (IAVs) use host translation machinery to decode viral mRNAs. IAVs ensure efficient translation of viral mRNAs through host shutoff, a process whereby viral proteins limit the accumulation of host proteins through subversion of their biogenesis. Despite its small genome, the virus deploys multiple host shutoff mechanisms at different stages of infection, thereby ensuring successful replication while limiting the communication of host antiviral responses. In this Gem, we review recent data on IAV host shutoff proteins, frame the outstanding questions in the field, and propose a temporally coordinated model of IAV host shutoff.

Title: Influenza virus propagation in embryonated chicken eggs.
Abstract: Influenza infection is associated with about 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations every year in the United States. The continuous emergence of new influenza virus strains due to mutation and re-assortment complicates the control of the virus and necessitates the permanent development of novel drugs and vaccines. The laboratory-based study of influenza requires a reliable and cost-effective method for the propagation of the virus. Here, a comprehensive protocol is provided for influenza A virus propagation in fertile chicken eggs, which consistently yields high titer viral stocks. In brief, serum pathogen-free (SPF) fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37 °C and 55-60% humidity for 10-11 days. Over this period, embryo development can be easily monitored using an egg candler. Virus inoculation is carried out by injection of virus stock into the allantoic cavity using a needle. After 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, the eggs are chilled for at least 4 hr at 4 °C. The eggshell above the air sac and the chorioallantoic membrane are then carefully opened, and the allantoic fluid containing the virus is harvested. The fluid is cleared from debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and transferred to -80 °C for long-term storage. The large amount (5-10 ml of virus-containing fluid per egg) and high virus titer which is usually achieved with this protocol has made the usage of eggs for virus preparation our favorable method, in particular for in vitro studies which require large quantities of virus in which high dosages of the same virus stock are needed.

Title: A Broad Anti-influenza Hybrid Small Molecule That Potently Disrupts the Interaction of Polymerase Acidic Protein-Basic Protein 1 (PA-PB1) Subunits.
Abstract: In continuing our efforts to identify small molecules able to disrupt the interaction of the polymerase acidic protein-basic protein 1 (PA-PB1) subunits of influenza virus (Flu) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, this paper is devoted to the optimization of a dihydrotriazolopyrimidine derivative, previously identified through structure-based drug discovery. The structure modifications performed around the bicyclic core led to the identification of compounds endowed with both the ability to disrupt PA-PB1 subunits interaction and anti-Flu activity with no cytotoxicity. Very interesting results were obtained with the hybrid molecules 36 and 37, designed by merging some peculiar structural features known to impart PA-PB1 interaction inhibition, with compound 36 that emerged as the most potent PA-PB1 interaction inhibitor (IC50 = 1.1 μM) among all the small molecules reported so far. Calculations showed a very favored H-bonding between the 2-amidic carbonyl of 36 and Q408, which seems to justify its potent ability to interfere with the interaction of the polymerase subunits.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on small molecule inhibitors disrupting PA-PB1 interaction and their antiviral activity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Wild bird surveillance around outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) virus in the Netherlands, 2014, within the context of global flyways.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) viruses that emerged in poultry in east Asia since 2010 spread to Europe and North America by late 2014. Despite detections in migrating birds, the role of free-living wild birds in the global dispersal of H5N8 virus is unclear. Here, wild bird sampling activities in response to the H5N8 virus outbreaks in poultry in the Netherlands are summarised along with a review on ring recoveries. HPAI H5N8 virus was detected exclusively in two samples from ducks of the Eurasian wigeon species, among 4,018 birds sampled within a three months period from mid-November 2014. The H5N8 viruses isolated from wild birds in the Netherlands were genetically closely related to and had the same gene constellation as H5N8 viruses detected elsewhere in Europe, in Asia and in North America, suggesting a common origin. Ring recoveries of migratory duck species from which H5N8 viruses have been isolated overall provide evidence for indirect migratory connections between East Asia and Western Europe and between East Asia and North America. This study is useful for better understanding the role of wild birds in the global epidemiology of H5N8 viruses. The need for sampling large numbers of wild birds for the detection of H5N8 virus and H5N8-virus-specific antibodies in a variety of species globally is highlighted, with specific emphasis in north-eastern Europe, Russia and northern China.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and genetic relatedness of H5N8 viruses in wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Coronavirus and influenza virus proteolytic priming takes place in tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains.
Abstract: Coronaviruses (CoVs) and low-pathogenicity influenza A viruses (LP IAVs) depend on target cell proteases to cleave their viral glycoproteins and prime them for virus-cell membrane fusion. Several proteases cluster into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), suggesting that TEMs are preferred virus entry portals. Here we found that several CoV receptors and virus-priming proteases were indeed present in TEMs. Isolated TEMs, when mixed with CoV and LP IAV pseudoparticles, cleaved viral fusion proteins to fusion-primed fragments and potentiated viral transductions. That entering viruses utilize TEMs as a protease source was further confirmed using tetraspanin antibodies and tetraspanin short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Tetraspanin antibodies inhibited CoV and LP IAV infections, but their virus-blocking activities were overcome by expressing excess TEM-associated proteases. Similarly, cells with reduced levels of the tetraspanin CD9 resisted CoV pseudoparticle transductions but were made susceptible by overproducing TEM-associated proteases. These findings indicated that antibodies and CD9 depletions interfere with viral proteolytic priming in ways that are overcome by surplus proteases. TEMs appear to be exploited by some CoVs and LP IAVs for appropriate coengagement with cell receptors and proteases. Enveloped viruses use their surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion, an essential cell entry step. Host cell components prime these viral surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion at specific times and places during virus cell entry. Among these priming components are proteases, which cleave viral surface glycoproteins, unleashing them to refold in ways that catalyze virus-cell membrane fusions. For some enveloped viruses, these proteases are known to reside on target cell surfaces. This research focuses on coronavirus and influenza A virus cell entry and identifies TEMs as sites of viral proteolysis, thereby defining subcellular locations of virus priming with greater precision. Implications of these findings extend to the use of virus entry antagonists, such as protease inhibitors, which might be most effective when localized to these microdomains.

Exposure of a glucose-bearing substrate to influenza viruses or its enzyme, neuraminidase (NA), releases glucose, which was detected amperometrically. Two methods were used to detect released glucose. First, we used a standard glucose blood meter to detect two viral NAs and three influenza strains. We also demonstrated drug susceptibility of two antivirals, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir, using the assay. Finally, we used disposable test strips to detect nineteen H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains using this assay in one hour. The limit and range of detection of this first generation assay is 10(2) and 10(2)-10(8) plaque forming units (pfu), respectively. Current user-friendly glucose meters can be repurposed to detect influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes an electrochemical assay for virus detection and drug susceptibility testing, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multi-spectral fluorescent reporter influenza viruses (Color-flu) as powerful tools for in vivo studies.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza A viruses cause annual epidemics of respiratory disease; highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and the recently emerged H7N9 viruses cause severe infections in humans, often with fatal outcomes. Although numerous studies have addressed the pathogenicity of influenza viruses, influenza pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we generate influenza viruses expressing fluorescent proteins of different colours ('Color-flu' viruses) to facilitate the study of viral infection in in vivo models. On adaptation to mice, stable expression of the fluorescent proteins in infected animals allows their detection by different types of microscopy and by flow cytometry. We use this system to analyse the progression of viral spread in mouse lungs, for live imaging of virus-infected cells, and for differential gene expression studies in virus antigen-positive and virus antigen-negative live cells in the lungs of Color-flu-infected mice. Collectively, Color-flu viruses are powerful tools to analyse virus infections at the cellular level in vivo to better understand influenza pathogenesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on generating fluorescent reporter influenza viruses to study infection progression and pathogenesis, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral effect of methylated flavonol isorhamnetin against influenza.
Abstract: Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease with frequent seasonal epidemics that causes a high rate of mortality and morbidity in humans, poultry, and animals. Influenza is a serious economic concern due to the costly countermeasures it necessitates. In this study, we compared the antiviral activities of several flavonols and other flavonoids with similar, but distinct, hydroxyl or methyl substitution patterns at the 3, 3', and 4' positions of the 15-carbon flavonoid skeleton, and found that the strongest antiviral effect was induced by isorhamnetin. Similar to quercetin and kaempferol, isorhamnetin possesses a hydroxyl group on the C ring, but it has a 3'-methyl group on the B ring that is absent in quercetin and kaempferol. Co-treatment and pre-treatment with isorhamnetin produced a strong antiviral effect against the influenza virus A/PR/08/34(H1N1). However, isorhamnetin showed the most potent antiviral potency when administered after viral exposure (post-treatment method) in vitro. Isorhamnetin treatment reduced virus-induced ROS generation and blocked cytoplasmic lysosome acidification and the lipidation of microtubule associated protein1 light chain 3-B (LC3B). Oral administration of isorhamnetin in mice infected with the influenza A virus significantly decreased lung virus titer by 2 folds, increased the survival rate which ranged from 70-80%, and decreased body weight loss by 25%. In addition, isorhamnetin decreased the virus titer in ovo using embryonated chicken eggs. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of isorhamnetin could explain its strong anti-influenza virus potency; the methyl group located on the B ring of isorhamnetin may contribute to its strong antiviral potency against influenza virus in comparison with other flavonoids.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates antiviral effects of flavonols against influenza virus, focusing on chemical structure-activity relationships rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Glycyrrhizic acid derivatives as influenza A/H1N1 virus inhibitors.
Abstract: This Letter describes the synthesis and antiviral activity study of some glycyrrhizic acid (GL) derivatives against influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 virus in MDCK cells. Conjugation of GL with l-amino acids or their methyl esters, and amino sugar (d-galactose amine) dramatically changed its activity. The most active compounds were GL conjugates with aromatic amino acids methyl esters (phenylalanine and tyrosine) (SI=61 and 38), and S-benzyl-cysteine (SI=71). Thus modification of GL is a perspective route in the search of new antivirals, and some of GL derivatives are potent as anti-influenza A/H1N1 agents.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on synthesis and antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid derivatives against influenza virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of MDCK cell-derived influenza H7N9 vaccine candidates in ferrets.
Abstract: Avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) viruses emerged as human pathogens in China in early 2013 and have killed >100 persons. Influenza vaccines are mainly manufactured using egg-based technology which could not meet the surging demand during influenza pandemics. In this study, we evaluated cell-based influenza H7N9 vaccines in ferrets. An egg-derived influenza H7N9 reassortant vaccine virus was adapted in MDCK cells. Influenza H7N9 whole virus vaccine antigen was manufactured using a microcarrier-based culture system. Immunogenicity and protection of the vaccine candidates with three different formulations (300 μg aluminum hydroxide, 1.5 μg HA, and 1.5 μg HA plus 300 μg aluminum hydroxide) were evaluated in ferrets. In ferrets receiving two doses of vaccination, geometric mean titers of hemagglutination (HA) inhibition and neutralizing antibodies were <10 and <40 for the control group (adjuvant only), 17 and 80 for the unadjuvanted (HA only) group, and 190 and 640 for the adjuvanted group (HA plus adjuvant), respectively. After challenge with wild-type influenza H7N9 viruses, virus titers in respiratory tracts of the adjuvanted group were significantly lower than that in the control, and unadjuvanted groups. MDCK cell-derived influenza H7N9 whole virus vaccine candidate is immunogenic and protective in ferrets and clinical development is highly warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates vaccine candidates and their immunogenicity and protection in ferrets, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Household transmissibility of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, China, February to May 2013 and October 2013 to March 2014.
Abstract: To study human-to-human transmissibility of the avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China, household contact information was collected for 125 index cases during the spring wave (February to May 2013), and for 187 index cases during the winter wave (October 2013 to March 2014). Using a statistical model, we found evidence for human-to-human transmission, but such transmission is not sustainable. Under plausible assumptions about the natural history of disease and the relative transmission frequencies in settings other than household, we estimate the household secondary attack rate (SAR) among humans to be 1.4% (95% CI: 0.8 to 2.3), and the basic reproductive number R0 to be 0.08 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.13). The estimates range from 1.3% to 2.2% for SAR and from 0.07 to 0.12 for R0 with reasonable changes in the assumptions. There was no significant change in the human-to-human transmissibility of the virus between the two waves, although a minor increase was observed in the winter wave. No sex or age difference in the risk of infection from a human source was found. Human-to-human transmissibility of H7N9 continues to be limited, but it needs to be closely monitored for potential increase via genetic reassortment or mutation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes household transmissibility of H7N9 virus using epidemiological data and statistical modeling, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Modularity enhances the rate of evolution in a rugged fitness landscape.
Abstract: Biological systems are modular, and this modularity affects the evolution of biological systems over time and in different environments. We here develop a theory for the dynamics of evolution in a rugged, modular fitness landscape. We show analytically how horizontal gene transfer couples to the modularity in the system and leads to more rapid rates of evolution at short times. The model, in general, analytically demonstrates a selective pressure for the prevalence of modularity in biology. We use this model to show how the evolution of the influenza virus is affected by the modularity of the proteins that are recognized by the human immune system. Approximately 25% of the observed rate of fitness increase of the virus could be ascribed to a modular viral landscape.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a theoretical model on modularity and evolution rate, discussing influenza virus evolution broadly without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: In vivo therapeutic protection against influenza A (H1N1) oseltamivir-sensitive and resistant viruses by the iminosugar UV-4.
Abstract: Our lead iminosugar analog called UV-4 or N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin inhibits activity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) α-glucosidases I and II and is a potent, host-targeted antiviral candidate. The mechanism of action for the antiviral activity of iminosugars is proposed to be inhibition of ER α-glucosidases leading to misfolding of critical viral glycoproteins. These misfolded glycoproteins would then be incorporated into defective virus particles or targeted for degradation resulting in a reduction of infectious progeny virions. UV-4, and its hydrochloride salt known as UV-4B, is highly potent against dengue virus in vitro and promotes complete survival in a lethal dengue virus mouse model. In the current studies, UV-4 was shown to be highly efficacious via oral gavage against both oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant influenza A (H1N1) infections in mice even if treatment was initiated as late as 48-72 hours after infection. The minimal effective dose was found to be 80-100 mg/kg when administered orally thrice daily. UV-4 treatment did not affect the development of protective antibody responses after either influenza infection or vaccination. Therefore, UV-4 is a promising candidate for further development as a therapeutic intervention against influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates a host-targeted antiviral compound's efficacy against influenza virus, focusing on therapeutic effects rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Construction and heterologous expression of a truncated Haemagglutinin (HA) protein from the avian influenza virus H5N1 in Escherichia coli.
Abstract: Malaysia first reported H5N1 poultry case in 2004 and subsequently outbreak in poultry population in 2007. Here, a recombinant gene encoding of peptide epitopes, consisting fragments of HA1, HA2 and a polybasic cleavage site of H5N1 strain Malaysia, was amplified and cloned into pET-47b(+) bacterial expression vector. DNA sequencing and alignment analysis confirmed that the gene had no alteration and in-frame to the vector. Then, His-tagged truncated HA protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under 1 mM IPTG induction. The protein expression was optimized under a time-course induction study and further purified using Ni-NTA agarose under reducing condition. Migration size of protein was detected at 15 kDa by Western blot using anti-His tag monoclonal antibody and demonstrated no discrepancy compared to its calculated molecular weight.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on construction and expression of a truncated HA protein from H5N1 in E. coli, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Comparison of traditional intranasal and aerosol inhalation inoculation of mice with influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Intranasal instillation of virus in a liquid suspension (IN) is the most frequently employed method to inoculate small mammalian models with influenza virus, but does not reflect a natural route of exposure. In contrast, inoculation via aerosol inhalation (AR) more closely resembles human exposure to influenza virus. Studies in mice have yielded conflicting results regarding virulence induced by virus inoculated by these routes, and have not controlled for potential strain-specific differences, or examined contemporary influenza viruses and avian viruses with pandemic potential. We used a whole-body AR inoculation method to compare infectivity and disease progression of a highly pathogenic H5N1, a low pathogenic H7N9, and a 2009 H1N1 virus with traditional IN inoculation in the mouse model. Generally comparable levels of morbidity and mortality were observed with all viruses examined using either inoculation route, indicating that both IN and AR delivery are appropriate for murine studies investigating influenza virus pathogenicity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares inoculation methods and disease progression but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A new method to cluster DNA sequences using Fourier power spectrum.
Abstract: A novel clustering method is proposed to classify genes and genomes. For a given DNA sequence, a binary indicator sequence of each nucleotide is constructed, and Discrete Fourier Transform is applied on these four sequences to attain respective power spectra. Mathematical moments are built from these spectra, and multidimensional vectors of real numbers are constructed from these moments. Cluster analysis is then performed in order to determine the evolutionary relationship between DNA sequences. The novelty of this method is that sequences with different lengths can be compared easily via the use of power spectra and moments. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method provides an efficient tool to classify genes and genomes. It not only gives comparable results but also is remarkably faster than other multiple sequence alignment and alignment-free methods.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper proposes a computational method for clustering DNA sequences without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The use of nonhuman primates in research on seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza, 1893-2014.
Abstract: Attempts to reproduce the features of human influenza in laboratory animals date from the early 1890s, when Richard Pfeiffer inoculated apes with bacteria recovered from influenza patients and produced a mild respiratory illness. Numerous studies employing nonhuman primates (NHPs) were performed during the 1918 pandemic and the following decade. Most used bacterial preparations to infect animals, but some sought a filterable agent for the disease. Since the viral etiology of influenza was established in the early 1930s, studies in NHPs have been supplemented by a much larger number of experiments in mice, ferrets and human volunteers. However, the emergence of a novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus in 1976 and the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in 1997 stimulated an increase in NHP research, because these agents are difficult to study in naturally infected patients and cannot be administered to human volunteers. In this paper, we review the published literature on the use of NHPs in influenza research from 1893 through the end of 2014. The first section summarizes observational studies of naturally occurring influenza-like syndromes in wild and captive primates, including serologic investigations. The second provides a chronological account of experimental infections of NHPs, beginning with Pfeiffer's study and covering all published research on seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, including vaccine and antiviral drug testing. The third section reviews experimental infections of NHPs with avian influenza viruses that have caused disease in humans since 1997. The paper concludes with suggestions for further studies to more clearly define and optimize the role of NHPs as experimental animals for influenza research.

Title: Update: Influenza activity--United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015.
Abstract: Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. To date, influenza A (H3N2) viruses have predominated overall. As has been observed in previous seasons during which influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated, adults aged ≥65 years have been most severely affected. The cumulative laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalization rate among adults aged ≥65 years is the highest recorded since this type of surveillance began in 2005. This age group also accounts for the majority of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza. The majority of circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal vaccines, and the predominance of these antigenically and genetically drifted viruses has resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* since September 28, 2014, and updates the previous summary.

Title: Extracting transmission networks from phylogeographic data for epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio in Nigeria.
Abstract: Phylogeography improves our understanding of spatial epidemiology. However, application to practical problems requires choices among computational tools to balance statistical rigor, computational complexity, sensitivity to sampling strategy and interpretability. We introduce a fast, heuristic algorithm to reconstruct partially-observed transmission networks (POTN) that combines features of phylogenetic and transmission tree approaches. We compare the transmission network generated by POTN with existing algorithms (BEAST and SeqTrack), and discuss the benefits and challenges of phylogeographic analysis on examples of epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus, H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio. For the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola virus outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, all three methods provide similarly plausible transmission histories but differ in detail. For polio in northern Nigeria, we discuss performance trade-offs between the POTN and discrete phylogeography in BEAST and conclude that spatial history reconstruction is limited by under-sampling. POTN is complementary to available tools on densely-sampled data, fails gracefully on under-sampled data and is scalable to accommodate larger datasets. We provide further evidence for the utility of phylogeography for understanding transmission networks of rapidly evolving epidemics. We propose simple heuristic criteria to identify how sampling rates and disease dynamics interact to determine fundamental limitations of phylogeographic inference.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogeographic methods and transmission network reconstruction without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Nothing to sneeze at: a dynamic and integrative computational model of an influenza A virion.
Abstract: The influenza virus is surrounded by an envelope composed of a lipid bilayer and integral membrane proteins. Understanding the structural dynamics of the membrane envelope provides biophysical insights into aspects of viral function, such as the wide-ranging survival times of the virion in different environments. We have combined experimental data from X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and lipidomics to build a model of the intact influenza A virion. This is the basis of microsecond-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the virion, providing simulations at different temperatures and with varying lipid compositions. The presence of the Forssman glycolipid alters a number of biophysical properties of the virion, resulting in reduced mobility of bilayer lipid and protein species. Reduced mobility in the virion membrane may confer physical robustness to changes in environmental conditions. Our simulations indicate that viral spike proteins do not aggregate and thus are competent for multivalent immunoglobulin G interactions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a computational model of influenza virion structure and dynamics without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Effectiveness and knowledge, attitudes and practices of seasonal influenza vaccine in primary healthcare settings in South Africa, 2010-2013.
Abstract: Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and coverage data for sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. Using a test-negative case-control design, we estimated influenza VE annually among individuals with influenza-like illness presenting to an outpatient sentinel surveillance programme in South Africa from 2010 to 2013. A knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) influenza vaccine survey of programme clinicians was conducted in 2013. In total, 9420 patients were enrolled in surveillance of whom 5344 (56.7%) were included in the VE analysis: 2678 (50.1%) were classified as controls (influenza test-negative) and 2666 (49.9%) as cases (influenza test-positive). Mean annual influenza vaccine coverage among controls was 4.5% for the four years. Annual VE estimates adjusted for age, underlying medical conditions and seasonality for 2010-2013 were 54.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-78.6%), 57.1% (95% CI: 15.5-78.2%), 38.4% (95% CI: -71.7-78.1%) and 87.2% (95% CI: 67.2-95.0%), respectively. The KAP survey showed that >90% of clinicians were familiar with the indications for and the benefits of influenza vaccination. Our study showed that the vaccine was significantly protective in 2010, 2011 and 2013, but not in 2012 when the circulating A(H3N2) strain showed genetic drift. Vaccine coverage was low despite good clinician knowledge of vaccination indications. Further studies are needed to investigate the reason for the low uptake of influenza vaccine.

Title: A(H7N9) virus results in early induction of proinflammatory cytokine responses in both human lung epithelial and endothelial cells and shows increased human adaptation compared with avian H5N1 virus.
Abstract: Similar to H5N1 viruses, A(H7N9) influenza viruses have been associated with severe respiratory disease and fatal outcomes in humans. While high viral load, hypercytokinemia, and pulmonary endothelial cell involvement are known to be hallmarks of H5N1 virus infection, the pathogenic mechanism of the A(H7N9) virus in humans is largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the ability of A(H7N9) virus to infect, replicate, and elicit innate immune responses in both human bronchial epithelial cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, compared with the abilities of seasonal H3N2, avian H7N9, and H5N1 viruses. In epithelial cells, A(H7N9) virus replicated efficiently but did not elicit robust induction of cytokines like that observed for H5N1 virus. In pulmonary endothelial cells, A(H7N9) virus efficiently initiated infection; however, no released infectious virus was detected. The magnitudes of induction of host cytokine responses were comparable between A(H7N9) and H5N1 virus infection. Additionally, we utilized differentiated human primary bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells to investigate cellular tropism using transmission electron microscopy and the impact of temperature on virus replication. Interestingly, A(H7N9) virus budded from the surfaces of both ciliated and mucin-secretory cells. Furthermore, A(H7N9) virus replicated to a significantly higher titer at 37 °C than at 33 °C, with improved replication capacity at 33 °C compared to that of H5N1 virus. These findings suggest that a high viral load from lung epithelial cells coupled with induction of host responses in endothelial cells may contribute to the severe pulmonary disease observed following H7N9 virus infection. Improved adaptation of A(H7N9) virus to human upper airway poses an important threat to public health. A(H7N9) influenza viruses have caused over 450 documented human infections with a 30% fatality rate since early 2013. However, these novel viruses lack many molecular determinants previously identified with mammalian pathogenicity, necessitating a closer examination of how these viruses elicit host responses which could be detrimental. This study provides greater insight into the interaction of this virus with host lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells, which results in high viral load, epithelial cell death, and elevated immune response in the lungs, revealing the mechanism of pathogenesis and disease development among A(H7N9)-infected patients. In particular, we characterized the involvement of pulmonary endothelial cells, a cell type in the human lung accessible to influenza virus following damage of the epithelial monolayer, and its potential role in the development of severe pneumonia caused by A(H7N9) infection in humans.

Title: Polygonum cuspidatum and its active components inhibit replication of the influenza virus through toll-like receptor 9-induced interferon beta expression.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is a global public health issue. The effectiveness of antiviral therapies for influenza has been limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel antiviral therapies. Here we tested the effects of 300 traditional Chinese medicines on the replication of various influenza virus strains in a lung cell line, A549, using an influenza-specific luciferase reporter assay. Of the traditional medicines tested, Polygonum cuspidatum (PC) and its active components, resveratrol and emodin, were found to attenuate influenza viral replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, they preferentially inhibited the replication of influenza A virus, including clinical strains isolated in 2009 and 2011 in Taiwan and the laboratory strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1). In addition to inhibiting the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, PC, emodin, and resveratrol also increased the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Moreover, the anti-viral activity of IFN-β or resveratrol was reduced when the A549 cells were treated with neutralizing anti-IFN-β antibodies or a TLR9 inhibitor, suggesting that IFN-β likely acts synergistically with resveratrol to inhibit H1N1 replication. This potential antiviral mechanism, involving direct inhibition of virus replication and simultaneous activation of the host immune response, has not been previously described for a single antiviral molecule. In conclusion, our data support the use of PC, resveratrol or emodin for inhibiting influenza virus replication directly and via TLR-9-induced IFN-β production.

Title: Cross-species transmission and emergence of novel viruses from birds.
Abstract: Birds, the only living member of the Dinosauria clade, are flying warm-blooded vertebrates displaying high species biodiversity, roosting and migratory behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system. Birds provide the natural reservoir for numerous viral species and therefore gene source for evolution, emergence and dissemination of novel viruses. The intrusions of human into natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and the increasing poultry consumption by human have facilitated avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel adenovirus was exclusively found in birds causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans. Instead of being the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human, a novel avian virus can be an augmenter of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of birds' evolutionary dynamics.

Title: Functions of the influenza A virus NS1 protein in antiviral defense.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses counteract host antiviral activities, especially the production of interferons (IFNs) and the activities of IFN-induced proteins that inhibit virus replication. The viral NS1 protein is largely responsible for countering these IFN antiviral responses, but there are functional differences between the NS1 proteins of different virus strains. The NS1 protein inhibits IFN production by two mechanisms: inhibition of the activation of IRF3 and IFN transcription; and inhibition of the processing of IFN pre-mRNAs. The NS1 proteins of several virus strains do not inhibit IRF3 activation, and the NS1 protein of one virus strain does not inhibit the processing of IFN pre-mRNAs. Many issues remain concerning the mechanisms of action of the various NS1 proteins in countering the IFN response.

Title: Why is coinfection with influenza virus and bacteria so difficult to control?
Abstract: Influenza viruses are genetically labile pathogens which avoid immune detection by constantly changing their coat proteins. Most human infections are caused by mildly pathogenic viruses which rarely cause life-threatening disease in healthy people, but some individuals with a weakened immune system can experience severe complications. Widespread infections with highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus are less common, but have the potential to cause enormous death tolls among healthy adults if infection rates reach pandemic proportions. Increased virulence has been attributed to a variety of factors, including enhanced susceptibility to coinfection with common strains of bacteria. The mechanisms that facilitate dual infection are a major focus of current research, as preventative measures are needed to avert future pandemics.

Title: Epimedium koreanum Nakai displays broad spectrum of antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo by inducing cellular antiviral state.
Abstract: Epimedium koreanum Nakai has been extensively used in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine to treat a variety of diseases. Despite the plant's known immune modulatory potential and chemical make-up, scientific information on its antiviral properties and mode of action have not been completely investigated. In this study, the broad antiviral spectrum and mode of action of an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai was evaluated in vitro, and moreover, the protective effect against divergent influenza A subtypes was determined in BALB/c mice. An effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakai markedly reduced the replication of Influenza A Virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Mechanically, we found that an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent stimulation of the antiviral state in cells. Among various components present in the extract, quercetin was confirmed to have striking antiviral properties. The oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai exhibited preventive effects on BALB/c mice against lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2). Therefore, an extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai and its components play roles as immunomodulators in the innate immune response, and may be potential candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against diverse viruses in animal and humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of a plant extract and its immunomodulatory effects but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The energy sensor AMPK regulates T cell metabolic adaptation and effector responses in vivo.
Abstract: Naive T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands of effector T cell function. However, how nutrient availability influences T cell metabolism and function remains poorly understood. Here we report plasticity in effector T cell metabolism in response to changing nutrient availability. Activated T cells were found to possess a glucose-sensitive metabolic checkpoint controlled by the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that regulated mRNA translation and glutamine-dependent mitochondrial metabolism to maintain T cell bioenergetics and viability. T cells lacking AMPKα1 displayed reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular ATP in response to glucose limitation in vitro or pathogenic challenge in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that AMPKα1 is essential for T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell development and primary T cell responses to viral and bacterial infections in vivo. Our data highlight AMPK-dependent regulation of metabolic homeostasis as a key regulator of T cell-mediated adaptive immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T cell metabolic regulation and immune responses, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Validation of normal human bronchial epithelial cells as a model for influenza A infections in human distal trachea.
Abstract: Primary normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells, derived from the distal-most aspect of the trachea at the bifurcation, have been used for a number of studies in respiratory disease research. Differences between the source tissue and the differentiated primary cells may impact infection studies based on this model. Therefore, we examined how well-differentiated NHBE cells compared with their source tissue, the human distal trachea, as well as the ramifications of these differences on influenza A viral pathogenesis research using this model. We employed a histological analysis including morphological measurements, electron microscopy, multi-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, lectin histochemistry, and microarray expression analysis to compare differentiated NHBEs to human distal tracheal epithelium. Pseudostratified epithelial height, cell type variety and distribution varied significantly. Electron microscopy confirmed differences in cellular attachment and paracellular junctions. Influenza receptor lectin histochemistry revealed that α2,3 sialic acids were rarely present on the apical aspect of the differentiated NHBE cells, but were present in low numbers in the distal trachea. We bound fluorochrome bioconjugated virus to respiratory tissue and NHBE cells and infected NHBE cells with human influenza A viruses. Both indicated that the pattern of infection progression in these cells correlated with autopsy studies of fatal cases from the 2009 pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper validates a cell model for influenza A infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes explicitly.

Title: Gene expression signatures as a therapeutic target for severe H7N9 influenza - what do we know so far?
Abstract: A novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China in early 2013 causing > 450 cases of respiratory illness and 175 deaths within a 20-month period. Though avian viruses infect humans infrequently, the lack of human immunity to these viruses raises the possibility of a pandemic if they were to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently. Despite the fact that IAV pathogenicity results from the cytopathic effects and tissue damage caused by both viral replication and an overly robust immune response, current IAV therapeutics only target the viral proteins. This has led to the emergence of drug resistance due to the high mutation rates of viruses. The growing obsolescence of our current influenza therapeutics underscores the need for alternative treatment strategies. One promising area of research is the use of drugs that target the host response to IAV infection. This article describes how gene expression profiling can be used to predict drugs that reverse the destructive effects of the host response to H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The article discusses gene expression signatures as therapeutic targets for H7N9 influenza but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification of novel compounds against an R294K substitution of influenza A (H7N9) virus using ensemble based drug virtual screening.
Abstract: Influenza virus H7N9 foremost emerged in China in 2013 and killed hundreds of people in Asia since they possessed all mutations that enable them to resist to all existing influenza drugs, resulting in high mortality to human. In the effort to identify novel inhibitors combat resistant strains of influenza virus H7N9; we performed virtual screening targeting the Neuraminidase (NA) protein against natural compounds of traditional Chinese medicine database (TCM) and ZINC natural products. Compounds expressed high binding affinity to the target protein was then evaluated for molecular properties to determine drug-like molecules. 4 compounds showed their binding energy less than -11 Kcal/mol were selected for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to capture intermolecular interactions of ligand-protein complexes. The molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method was utilized to estimate binding free energy of the complex. In term of stability, NA-7181 (IUPAC namely {9-Hydroxy-10-[3-(trifluoromrthyl) cyclohexyl]-4.8-diazatricyclo [6.4.0.02,6]dodec-4-yl}(perhydro-1H-inden-5-yl)formaldehyde) achieved stable conformation after 20 ns and 27 ns for ligand and protein root mean square deviation, respectively. In term of binding free energy, 7181 gave the negative value of -30.031 (KJ/mol) indicating the compound obtained a favourable state in the active site of the protein.

Title: Reverse zoonosis of influenza to swine: new perspectives on the human-animal interface.
Abstract: The origins of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in swine are unknown, highlighting gaps in our understanding of influenza A virus (IAV) ecology and evolution. We review how recently strengthened influenza virus surveillance in pigs has revealed that influenza virus transmission from humans to swine is far more frequent than swine-to-human zoonosis, and is central in seeding swine globally with new viral diversity. The scale of global human-to-swine transmission represents the largest 'reverse zoonosis' of a pathogen documented to date. Overcoming the bias towards perceiving swine as sources of human viruses, rather than recipients, is key to understanding how the bidirectional nature of the human-animal interface produces influenza threats to both hosts.

Title: Replication-competent influenza A viruses expressing a red fluorescent protein.
Abstract: Like most animal viruses, studying influenza A in model systems requires secondary methodologies to identify infected cells. To circumvent this requirement, we describe the generation of replication-competent influenza A red fluorescent viruses. These influenza A viruses encode mCherry fused to the viral non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and display comparable growth kinetics to wild-type viruses in vitro. Infection of cells with influenza A mCherry viruses was neutralized with monoclonal antibodies and inhibited with antivirals to levels similar to wild-type virus. Influenza A mCherry viruses were also able to lethally infect mice, and strikingly, dose- and time-dependent kinetics of viral replication were monitored in whole excised mouse lungs using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). By eliminating the need for secondary labeling of infected cells, influenza A mCherry viruses provide an ideal tool in the ongoing struggle to better characterize the virus and identify new therapeutics against influenza A viral infections.

Title: Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved viral restriction factors.
Abstract: The seven human sirtuins are a family of ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacylases/mono-ADP ribosyltransferases that regulate numerous cellular and organismal functions, including metabolism, cell cycle, and longevity. Here, we report the discovery that all seven sirtuins have broad-range antiviral properties. We demonstrate that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of individual sirtuins and drug-mediated inhibition of sirtuin enzymatic activity increase the production of virus progeny in infected human cells. This impact on virus growth is observed for both DNA and RNA viruses. Importantly, sirtuin-activating drugs inhibit the replication of diverse viruses, as we demonstrate for human cytomegalovirus, a slowly replicating DNA virus, and influenza A (H1N1) virus, an RNA virus that multiplies rapidly. Furthermore, sirtuin defense functions are evolutionarily conserved, since CobB, the sirtuin homologue in Escherichia coli, protects against bacteriophages. Altogether, our findings establish sirtuins as broad-spectrum and evolutionarily conserved components of the immune defense system, providing a framework for elucidating a new set of host cell defense mechanisms and developing sirtuin modulators with antiviral activity. We live in a sea of viruses, some of which are human pathogens. These pathogenic viruses exhibit numerous differences: DNA or RNA genomes, enveloped or naked virions, nuclear or cytoplasmic replication, diverse disease symptoms, etc. Most antiviral drugs target specific viral proteins. Consequently, they often work for only one virus, and their efficacy can be compromised by the rapid evolution of resistant variants. There is a need for the identification of host proteins with broad-spectrum antiviral functions, which provide effective targets for therapeutic treatments that limit the evolution of viral resistance. Here, we report that sirtuins present such an opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral treatments, since our findings highlight these enzymes as ancient defense factors that protect against a variety of viral pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses sirtuins as host antiviral factors but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic diversity of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in Saudi Arabia.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally in the spring of 2009. Saudi Arabia also witnessed a severe H1N1 pandemic virus epidemic with considerable morbidity and mortality in different parts of the kingdom beginning in June 2009. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in samples collected between May 2009 and November 2010 from Makkah region. This study provides data on the viral diagnosis and genetic diversity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus from Saudi Arabia. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 100 clinically infected patients in the peak of the outbreak were collected from Makkah region and processed for viral diagnosis by viral culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HA and NA genes of 10 selected samples were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 100 samples were collected; only 10 samples were found to be positive for influenza A virus infection by real-time PCR. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA and NA genes of influenza A (H1N1) from Saudi Arabia showed significant similarities with selected isolates. The phylogenetic tree constructed for both HA and NA genes formed close clusters with selected reference isolates. Nucleotide sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships of the HA and NA genes of influenza A (H1N1) virus from Saudi Arabia with selected reference isolates indicates that they were genetically close and most probably originated from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Title: Molecular characterization of an influenza A virus (H4N2) isolated from waterfowl habitats in the State of Mexico.
Abstract: Wild waterfowl and their habitats are the main reservoirs of influenza A virus (IAV) mainly during the breeding season and prior to migration. This study describes the molecular characterization of an IAV isolated from 240 water samples of a small wetland during non-breeding season of migratory wild ducks in the State of Mexico, Mexico. The results showed that the virus belongs to the H4N2 subtype and each of its eight segments of the viral genome has similarity to IAV isolated from ducks in North America. This study suggests that IAV can be isolated from small wetland during non-breeding season of migrating waterfowl.

Title: Culturing of respiratory viruses in well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium as a tool to detect unknown viruses.
Abstract: Currently, virus discovery is mainly based on molecular techniques. Here, we propose a method that relies on virus culturing combined with state-of-the-art sequencing techniques. The most natural ex vivo culture system was used to enable replication of respiratory viruses. Three respiratory clinical samples were tested on well-differentiated pseudostratified tracheobronchial human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures grown at an air-liquid interface, which resemble the airway epithelium. Cells were stained with convalescent serum of the patients to identify infected cells and apical washes were analyzed by VIDISCA-454, a next-generation sequencing virus discovery technique. Infected cells were observed for all three samples. Sequencing subsequently indicated that the cells were infected by either human coronavirus OC43, influenzavirus B, or influenzavirus A. The sequence reads covered a large part of the genome (52%, 82%, and 57%, respectively). We present here a new method for virus discovery that requires a virus culture on primary cells and an antibody detection. The virus in the harvest can be used to characterize the viral genome sequence and cell tropism, but also provides progeny virus to initiate experiments to fulfill the Koch's postulates.
Relevant: False

Title: Temporal dynamics, diversity, and interplay in three components of the virodiversity of a Mallard population: influenza A virus, avian paramyxovirus and avian coronavirus.
Abstract: Multiple infections, or simultaneous infection of a host with multiple parasites, are the rule rather than the exception. Interactions between co-occurring pathogens in a population may be mutualistic, competitive or facilitative. For some pathogen combinations, these interrelated effects will have epidemiological consequences; however this is as yet poorly incorporated into practical disease ecology. For example, screening of Mallards for influenza A viruses (IAV) have repeatedly revealed high prevalence and large subtype diversity in the Northern Hemisphere. Other studies have identified avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) and coronaviruses (CoVs) in Mallards, but without making inferences on the larger viral assemblage. In this study we followed 144 wild Mallards across an autumn season in a natural stopover site and constructed infection histories of IAV, APMV-1 and CoV. There was a high prevalence of IAV, comprising of 27 subtype combinations, while APMV-1 had a comparatively low prevalence (with a peak of 2%) and limited strain variation, similar to previous findings. Avian CoVs were common, with prevalence up to 12%, and sequence analysis identified different putative genetic lineages. An investigation of the dynamics of co-infections revealed a synergistic effect between CoV and IAV, whereby CoV prevalence was higher given that the birds were co-infected with IAV. There were no interactive effects between IAV and APMV-1. Disease dynamics are the result of an interplay between parasites, host immune responses, and resources; and is imperative that we begin to include all factors to better understand infectious disease risk.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates co-infections and viral prevalence in wild birds but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cryptoporus volvatus extract inhibits influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza virus is the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, posing a serious health threat worldwide. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activities of Cryptoporus volvatus extract on influenza virus infection. Our results demonstrated that the Cryptoporus volvatus extract inhibited different influenza virus strain replication in MDCK cells. Time course analysis indicated that the extract exerted its inhibition at earlier and late stages in the replication cycle of influenza virus. Subsequently, we confirmed that the extract suppressed virus internalization into and released from cells. Moreover, the extract significantly reduced H1N1/09 influenza virus load in lungs and dramatically decreased lung lesions in mice. And most importantly, the extract protected mice from lethal challenge with H1N1/09 influenza virus. Our results suggest that the Cryptoporus volvatus extract could be a potential candidate for the development of a new anti-influenza virus therapy.

Title: A severe neurological complication of influenza in a previously well child.
Abstract: We describe a case of a 3-year-old girl who was admitted with encephalopathy and a right-sided hemiparesis secondary to acute influenza A. She was up-to-date with the Australian National Immunisation Program (which does not routinely include the seasonal influenza vaccine). After initial treatment with intravenous antimicrobials and acyclovir, a brain and spinal cord MRI demonstrated extensive focal necrotic and haemorrhagic changes in keeping with acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE). She was started on a course of oseltamivir and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, followed by an oral weaning regimen of prednisolone. After an intense period of rehabilitation, she has made a remarkable recovery. Genetic testing has since confirmed that this girl has the RANBP2 gene mutation, which leads to increased susceptibility of developing ANE. This case report highlights ANE as a rare but severe complication of influenza, the unfortunate complication of having the RANBP2 mutation and the importance of paediatric influenza vaccination.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical case report describing a neurological complication of influenza in a patient with a genetic mutation unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Avian influenza virus (H11N9) in migratory shorebirds wintering in the Amazon Region, Brazil.
Abstract: Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIV). Habitats in Brazil provide stopover and wintering sites for water birds that migrate between North and South America. The current study was conducted to elucidate the possibility of the transport of influenza A viruses by birds that migrate annually between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In total, 556 orotracheal/cloacal swab samples were collected for influenza A virus screening using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The influenza A virus-positive samples were subjected to viral isolation. Four samples were positive for the influenza A matrix gene by rRT-PCR. From these samples, three viruses were isolated, sequenced and characterized. All positive samples originated from a single bird species, the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), that was caught in the Amazon region at Caeté Bay, Northeast Pará, at Ilha de Canelas. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of H11N9 in the ruddy turnstone in South America.

Title: Improving pandemic influenza risk assessment.
Abstract: Assessing the pandemic risk posed by specific non-human influenza A viruses is an important goal in public health research. As influenza virus genome sequencing becomes cheaper, faster, and more readily available, the ability to predict pandemic potential from sequence data could transform pandemic influenza risk assessment capabilities. However, the complexities of the relationships between virus genotype and phenotype make such predictions extremely difficult. The integration of experimental work, computational tool development, and analysis of evolutionary pathways, together with refinements to influenza surveillance, has the potential to transform our ability to assess the risks posed to humans by non-human influenza viruses and lead to improved pandemic preparedness and response.

Title: Swine interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins potently inhibit influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: Human interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) were identified as restriction factors of influenza A virus (IAV). Given the important role of pigs in the zoonotic cycle of IAV, we cloned swine IFITMs (swIFITMs) and found two IFITM1-like proteins, one homologue of IFITM2, and a homologue of IFITM3. We show that swIFITM2 and swIFITM3 localize to endosomes and display potent antiviral activities. Knockdown of swIFITMs strongly reduced virus inhibition by interferon, establishing the swIFITMs as potent restriction factors in porcine cells.

Title: Interaction of NS2 with AIMP2 facilitates the switch from ubiquitination to SUMOylation of M1 in influenza A virus-infected cells.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) rely on host factors to support their life cycle, as viral proteins hijack or interact with cellular proteins to execute their functions. Identification and understanding of these factors would increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms manipulated by the viruses. In this study, we searched for novel binding partners of the influenza A virus NS2 protein, the nuclear export protein responsible for overcoming host range restriction, by a yeast two-hybrid screening assay and glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays and identified AIMP2, a potent tumor suppressor that usually functions to regulate protein stability, as one of the major NS2-binding candidates. We found that the presence of NS2 protected AIMP2 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation in NS2-transfected cells and AIMP2 functioned as a positive regulator of IAV replication. Interestingly, AIMP2 had no significant effect on NS2 but enhanced the stability of the matrix protein M1. Further, we provide evidence that AIMP2 recruitment switches the modification of M1 from ubiquitination to SUMOylation, which occurs on the same attachment site (K242) on M1 and thereby promotes M1-mediated viral ribonucleoprotein complex nuclear export to increase viral replication. Collectively, our results reveal a new mechanism of AIMP2 mediation of influenza virus replication. Although the ubiquitination of M1 during IAV infection has been observed, the precise modification site and the molecular consequences of this modification remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that ubiquitin and SUMO compete for the same lysine (K242) on M1 and the interaction of NS2 with AIMP2 facilitates the switch of the M1 modification from ubiquitination to SUMOylation, thus increasing viral replication.

Title: High basal expression of interferon-stimulated genes in human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells contributes to influenza A virus resistance.
Abstract: Respiratory epithelial cells play a key role in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenesis and host innate response. Transformed human respiratory cell lines are widely used in the study of IAV-host interactions due to their relative convenience, and inherent difficulties in working with primary cells. Transformed cells, however, may have altered susceptibility to virus infection. Proper characterization of different respiratory cell types in their responses to IAV infection is therefore needed to ensure that the cell line chosen will provide results that are of relevance in vivo. We compared replication kinetics of human H1N1 (A/USSR/77) IAVs in normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and two commonly used respiratory epithelial cell lines namely BEAS-2B and A549 cells. We found that IAV replication was distinctly poor in BEAS-2B cells in comparison with NHBE, A549 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. IAV resistance in BEAS-2B cells was accompanied by an activated antiviral state with high basal expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7), stimulator of IFN genes (STING) and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Treatment of BEAS-2B cells with a pan-Janus-activated-kinase (JAK) inhibitor decreased IRF-7 and ISG expression and resulted in increased IAV replication. Therefore, the use of highly resistant BEAS-2B cells in IAV infection may not reflect the cytopathogenicity of IAV in human epithelial cells in vivo.

Title: DnaJA1/Hsp40 is co-opted by influenza A virus to enhance its viral RNA polymerase activity.
Abstract: The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza A virus is a heterotrimeric complex composed of the PB1, PB2, and PA subunits. The interplay between host factors and the three subunits of the RdRp is critical to enable viral RNA synthesis to occur in the nuclei of infected cells. In this study, we newly identified host factor DnaJA1, a member of the type I DnaJ/Hsp40 family, acting as a positive regulator for influenza virus replication. We found that DnaJA1 associates with the bPB2 and PA subunits and enhances viral RNA synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, DnaJA1 could be translocated from cytoplasm into the nucleus upon influenza virus infection. The translocation of DnaJA1 is specifically accompanied by PB1-PA nuclear import. Interestingly, we observed that the effect of DnaJA1 on viral RNA synthesis is mainly dependent on its C-terminal substrate-binding domain and not on its typical J domain, while the J domain normally mediates the Hsp70-DnaJ interaction required for regulating Hsp70 ATPase activity. Therefore, we propose that DnaJA1 is co-opted by the influenza A virus to enter the nucleus and to enhance its RNA polymerase activity in an Hsp70 cochaperone-independent manner. The interplay between host factors and influenza virus RNA polymerase plays a critical role in determining virus pathogenicity and host adaptation. In this study, we newly identified a host protein, DnaJA1/Hsp40, that is co-opted by influenza A virus RNA polymerase to enhance its viral RNA synthesis in the nuclei of infected cells. We found that DnaJA1 associates with both PB2 and PA subunits and translocates into the nucleus along with the nuclear import of the PB1-PA dimer during influenza virus replication. Interestingly, the effect of DnaJA1 is mainly dependent on its C-terminal substrate-binding domain and not on its typical J domain, which is required for its Hsp70 cochaperone function. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a member of the Hsp40s that is specifically involved in regulating influenza virus RNA polymerase. Targeting the interactions between polymerase subunits and DnaJA1 may provide a novel strategy to develop antiviral drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host factor DnaJA1 interaction with viral polymerase subunits enhancing viral RNA synthesis, but does not explicitly link viral genotype variations to phenotypes.

Title: Determining the phylogenetic and phylogeographic origin of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N3) in Mexico.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza virus (AIV) H7N3 outbreaks occurred 3 times in the Americas in the past 10 years and caused severe economic loss in the affected regions. In June/July 2012, new HP H7N3 outbreaks occurred at commercial farms in Jalisco, Mexico. Outbreaks continued to be identified in neighbouring states in Mexico till August 2013. To explore the origin of this outbreak, time resolved phylogenetic trees were generated from the eight segments of full-length AIV sequences in North America using BEAST. Location, subtype, avian host species and pathogenicity were modelled as discrete traits upon the trees using continuous time Markov chains. A further joint analysis among segments was performed using a hierarchical phylogenetic model (HPM) which allowed trait rates (location, subtype, host species) to be jointly inferred across different segments. The complete spatial diffusion process was visualised through virtual globe software. Our result indicated the Mexico HP H7N3 originated from the large North America low pathogenicity AIV pool through complicated reassortment events. Different segments were contributed by wild waterfowl from different N. American flyways. Five of the eight segments (HA, NA, NP, M, NS) were introduced from wild birds migrating along the central North American flyway, and PB2, PB1 and PA were introduced via the western North American flyway. These results highlight a potential role for Mexico as a hotspot of virus reassortment as it is where wild birds from different migration routes mix during the winter.

Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic and phylogeographic origins of H7N3 outbreaks without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus infection in zebrafish recapitulates mammalian infection and sensitivity to anti-influenza drug treatment.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza virus infections cause annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics. These present a global health concern, resulting in substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burdens. Prevention and treatment of influenza illness is difficult due to the high mutation rate of the virus, the emergence of new virus strains and increasing antiviral resistance. Animal models of influenza infection are crucial to our gaining a better understanding of the pathogenesis of and host response to influenza infection, and for screening antiviral compounds. However, the current animal models used for influenza research are not amenable to visualization of host-pathogen interactions or high-throughput drug screening. The zebrafish is widely recognized as a valuable model system for infectious disease research and therapeutic drug testing. Here, we describe a zebrafish model for human influenza A virus (IAV) infection and show that zebrafish embryos are susceptible to challenge with both influenza A strains APR8 and X-31 (Aichi). Influenza-infected zebrafish show an increase in viral burden and mortality over time. The expression of innate antiviral genes, the gross pathology and the histopathology in infected zebrafish recapitulate clinical symptoms of influenza infections in humans. This is the first time that zebrafish embryos have been infected with a fluorescent IAV in order to visualize infection in a live vertebrate host, revealing a pattern of vascular endothelial infection. Treatment of infected zebrafish with a known anti-influenza compound, Zanamivir, reduced mortality and the expression of a fluorescent viral gene product, demonstrating the validity of this model to screen for potential antiviral drugs. The zebrafish model system has provided invaluable insights into host-pathogen interactions for a range of infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate a novel use of this species for IAV research. This model has great potential to advance our understanding of influenza infection and the associated host innate immune response.

Title: Sequence-based antigenic change prediction by a sparse learning method incorporating co-evolutionary information.
Abstract: Rapid identification of influenza antigenic variants will be critical in selecting optimal vaccine candidates and thus a key to developing an effective vaccination program. Recent studies suggest that multiple simultaneous mutations at antigenic sites accumulatively enhance antigenic drift of influenza A viruses. However, pre-existing methods on antigenic variant identification are based on analyses from individual sites. Because the impacts of these co-evolved sites on influenza antigenicity may not be additive, it will be critical to quantify the impact of not only those single mutations but also multiple simultaneous mutations or co-evolved sites. Here, we developed and applied a computational method, AntigenCO, to identify and quantify both single and co-evolutionary sites driving the historical antigenic drifts. AntigenCO achieved an accuracy of up to 90.05% for antigenic variant prediction, significantly outperforming methods based on single sites. AntigenCO can be useful in antigenic variant identification in influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a computational method paper predicting antigenic changes from sequence data but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Interactome analysis of the influenza A virus transcription/replication machinery identifies protein phosphatase 6 as a cellular factor required for efficient virus replication.
Abstract: The negative-sense RNA genome of influenza A virus is transcribed and replicated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The viral RdRP is an important host range determinant, indicating that its function is affected by interactions with cellular factors. However, the identities and the roles of most of these factors remain unknown. Here, we employed affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with the influenza A virus RdRP in infected human cells. We purified RdRPs using a recombinant influenza virus in which the PB2 subunit of the RdRP is fused to a Strep-tag. When this tagged subunit was purified from infected cells, copurifying proteins included the other RdRP subunits (PB1 and PA) and the viral nucleoprotein and neuraminidase, as well as 171 cellular proteins. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that the most abundant of these host proteins were chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, importins, proteins involved in ubiquitination, kinases and phosphatases, and mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins. Among the phosphatases, we identified three subunits of the cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), including the catalytic subunit PPP6C and regulatory subunits PPP6R1 and PPP6R3. PP6 was found to interact directly with the PB1 and PB2 subunits of the viral RdRP, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the catalytic subunit of PP6 in infected cells resulted in the reduction of viral RNA accumulation and the attenuation of virus growth. These results suggest that PP6 interacts with and positively regulates the activity of the influenza virus RdRP. Influenza A viruses are serious clinical and veterinary pathogens, causing substantial health and economic impacts. In addition to annual seasonal epidemics, occasional global pandemics occur when viral strains adapt to humans from other species. To replicate efficiently and cause disease, influenza viruses must interact with a large number of host factors. The reliance of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) on host factors makes it a major host range determinant. This study describes and quantifies host proteins that interact, directly or indirectly, with a subunit of the RdRP. It increases our understanding of the role of host proteins in viral replication and identifies a large number of potential barriers to pandemic emergence. Identifying host factors allows their importance for viral replication to be tested. Here, we demonstrate a role for the cellular phosphatase PP6 in promoting viral replication, contributing to our emerging knowledge of regulatory phosphorylation in influenza virus biology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host cellular factors interacting with influenza virus polymerase but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The interferon-induced gene Ifi27l2a is active in lung macrophages and lymphocytes after influenza A infection but deletion of Ifi27l2a in mice does not increase susceptibility to infection.
Abstract: Interferons represent one of the first and essential host defense mechanisms after infection, and the activation of the IFN-pathway results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. The alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2A (Ifi27l2a) gene (human synonym: ISG12) is strongly up-regulated in the lung after influenza A infection in mice and has been shown in gene expression studies to be highly correlated to other activated genes. Therefore, we investigated the role of Ifi27l2a for the host defense to influenza A infections in more detail. RT-PCR analyses in non-infected mice demonstrated that Ifi27l2a was expressed in several tissues, including the lung. Detailed analyses of reporter gene expression in lungs from Ifi27l2a-LacZ mice revealed that Ifi27l2a was expressed in macrophages and lymphocytes but not in alveolar cells or bronchiolar epithelium cells. The number of macrophages and lymphocyte strongly increased in the lung after infection, but no significant increase in expression levels of the LacZ reporter gene was found within individual immune cells. Also, no reporter gene expression was found in bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar cells or infiltrating neutrophils after infection. Thus, up-regulation of Ifi27l2a in infected lungs is mainly due to the infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. Most surprisingly, deletion of Ifi27l2a in mouse knock-out lines did not result in increased susceptibility to infections with H1N1 or H7N7 influenza A virus compared to wild type C57BL/6N mice, suggesting a less important role of the gene for the host response to influenza infections than for bacterial infections.

Title: RNA structural constraints in the evolution of the influenza A virus genome NP segment.
Abstract: Conserved RNA secondary structures were predicted in the nucleoprotein (NP) segment of the influenza A virus genome using comparative sequence and structure analysis. A number of structural elements exhibiting nucleotide covariations were identified over the whole segment length, including protein-coding regions. Calculations of mutual information values at the paired nucleotide positions demonstrate that these structures impose considerable constraints on the virus genome evolution. Functional importance of a pseudoknot structure, predicted in the NP packaging signal region, was confirmed by plaque assays of the mutant viruses with disrupted structure and those with restored folding using compensatory substitutions. Possible functions of the conserved RNA folding patterns in the influenza A virus genome are discussed.
Relevant: False

Title: Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of influenza A H7N9 virus.
Abstract: Recently, human infections with the novel avian-origin influenza A H7N9 virus have been reported from various provinces in China. Human infections with avian influenza A viruses are rare and may cause a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. This is the first time that human infection with a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus has been associated with a fatal outcome. Here, a phylogenetic and positive selective pressure analysis of haemagglutin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein (MP) genes of the novel reassortant H7N9 virus was carried out. The analysis showed that both structural genes of this reassortant virus likely originated from Euro-Asiatic birds, while NA was more likely to have originated from South Korean birds. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the MP showed a main clade and an outside cluster including four sequences from China. The United States and Guatemala classical H7N9-isolates appeared homogeneous and clustered together, although they are distinct from other classical Euro-Asiatic and novel H7N9 viruses. Selective pressure analysis did not reveal any site under statistically significant positive selective pressure in any of the three genes analyzed. Unknown certain intermediate hosts involved might be implicated, so extensive global surveillance and bird-to-person transmission should be closely considered in the future.

Reason: This is a phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of influenza A H7N9 virus genes without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza polymerase encoding mRNAs utilize atypical mRNA nuclear export.
Abstract: Influenza is a segmented negative strand RNA virus. Each RNA segment is encapsulated by influenza nucleoprotein and bound by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to form viral ribonucleoproteins responsible for RNA synthesis in the nucleus of the host cell. Influenza transcription results in spliced mRNAs (M2 and NS2), intron-containing mRNAs (M1 and NS1), and intron-less mRNAs (HA, NA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA), all of which undergo nuclear export into the cytoplasm for translation. Most cellular mRNA nuclear export is Nxf1-mediated, while select mRNAs utilize Crm1. Here we inhibited Nxf1 and Crm1 nuclear export prior to infection with influenza A/Udorn/307/1972(H3N2) virus and analyzed influenza intron-less mRNAs using cellular fractionation and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We examined direct interaction between Nxf1 and influenza intron-less mRNAs using immuno purification of Nxf1 and RT-PCR of associated RNA. Inhibition of Nxf1 resulted in less influenza intron-less mRNA export into the cytoplasm for HA and NA influenza mRNAs in both human embryonic kidney cell line (293 T) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549). However, in 293 T cells no change was observed for mRNAs encoding the components of the viral ribonucleoproteins; NP, PA, PB1, and PB2, while in A549 cells, only PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNAs, encoding the RdRP, remained unaffected; NP mRNA was reduced in the cytoplasm. In A549 cells NP, NA, HA, mRNAs were found associated with Nxf1 but PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNAs were not. Crm1 inhibition also resulted in no significant difference in PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNA nuclear export. These results further confirm Nxf1-mediated nuclear export is functional during the influenza life cycle and hijacked for select influenza mRNA nuclear export. We reveal a cell type difference for Nxf1-mediated nuclear export of influenza NP mRNA, a reminder that cell type can influence molecular mechanisms. Importantly, we conclude that in both A549 and 293 T cells, PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNA nuclear export is Nxf1 and Crm1 independent. Our data support the hypothesis that PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNAs, encoding the influenza RdRP, utilize atypical mRNA nuclear export.

Title: TLR ligands induce antiviral responses in chicken macrophages.
Abstract: Chicken macrophages express several receptors for recognition of pathogens, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived from bacterial or viral pathogens leading to the activation of macrophages. Macrophages play a critical role in immunity against viruses, including influenza viruses. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that treatment of chicken macrophages with TLR ligands reduces avian influenza replication. Furthermore, we sought to study the expression of some of the key mediators involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral responses of macrophages. Chicken macrophages were treated with the TLR2, 3, 4, 7 and 21 ligands, Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C), LPS, R848 and CpG ODN, respectively, at different doses and time points pre- and post-H4N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. The results revealed that pre-treatment of macrophages with Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN reduced the replication of AIV in chicken macrophages. In addition, the relative expression of genes involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses were quantified at 3, 8 and 18 hours post-treatment with the TLR2, 4 and 21 ligands. Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN-β and interferon regulatory factor (IFR) 7. The expression of these genes correlated with the reduction of viral replication in macrophages. These results shed light on the process of immunity to AIV in chickens.

Title: Heterogeneous pathological outcomes after experimental pH1N1 influenza infection in ferrets correlate with viral replication and host immune responses in the lung.
Abstract: The swine-origin pandemic (p) H1N1 influenza A virus causes mild upper-respiratory tract disease in most human patients. However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics. Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model. Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients. Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs. Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFNα in the lungs. Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts' capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study correlates pathological outcomes in ferrets with viral replication and host immune responses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Labeling of influenza viruses with synthetic fluorescent and biotin-labeled lipids.
Abstract: Direct labeling of virus particles is a powerful tool for the visualization of virus-cell interaction events. However, this technique involves the chemical modification of viral proteins that affects viral biological properties. Here we describe an alternative approach of influenza virus labeling that utilizes Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs that can be gently inserted into the virus membrane. We assessed whether labeling with fluorescent (fluo-Ad-DOPE) or biotin-labeled (biot-CMG2-DOPE) probes has any deleterious effect on influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) receptor specificity, neuraminidase (NA) activity, or replicative ability in vitro. Our data clearly show that neither construct significantly affected influenza virus infectivity or viral affinity to sialyl receptors. Neither construct influenced the NA activities of the influenza viruses tested, except the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) strain. Our data indicate that lipid labeling provides a powerful tool to analyze influenza virus infection in vitro.

Title: Influenza virus replication in lung epithelial cells depends on redox-sensitive pathways activated by NOX4-derived ROS.
Abstract: An overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) has been related to airway inflammation typical of influenza infection. Virus-induced oxidative stress may also control viral replication, but the mechanisms underlying ROS production, as well as their role in activating intracellular pathways and specific steps of viral life cycle under redox control have to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that influenza A virus infection of lung epithelial cells causes a significant ROS increase that depends mainly on NOX4, which is upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels, while the expression of NOX2, the primary source of ROS in inflammatory cells, is downregulated. Inhibition of NOX4 activity through chemical inhibitors or RNA silencing blocks the ROS increase, prevents MAPK phosphorylation, and inhibits viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) nuclear export and viral release. Overall these data, obtained in cell lines and primary culture, describe a so far unrecognized role for NOX4-derived ROS in activating redox-regulated intracellular pathways during influenza virus infection and highlight their relevance in controlling specific steps of viral replication in epithelial cells. Pharmacological modulation of NOX4-mediated ROS production may open the way for new therapeutic approaches to fighting influenza by targeting cell and not the virus.

Title: DESC1 and MSPL activate influenza A viruses and emerging coronaviruses for host cell entry.
Abstract: The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates the influenza virus and coronavirus surface proteins. Expression of TMPRSS2 is essential for the spread and pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. In contrast, H3N2 viruses are less dependent on TMPRSS2 for viral amplification, suggesting that these viruses might employ other TTSPs for their activation. Here, we analyzed TTSPs, reported to be expressed in the respiratory system, for the ability to activate influenza viruses and coronaviruses. We found that MSPL and, to a lesser degree, DESC1 are expressed in human lung tissue and cleave and activate the spike proteins of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. In addition, we show that these proteases support the spread of all influenza virus subtypes previously pandemic in humans. In sum, we identified two host cell proteases that could promote the amplification of influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in humans and might constitute targets for antiviral intervention. Importance: Activation of influenza viruses by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the enzymes responsible are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The present study demonstrates that two cellular serine proteases, DESC1 and MSPL, activate influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in cell culture and, because of their expression in human lung tissue, might promote viral spread in the infected host. Antiviral strategies aiming to prevent viral activation might thus need to encompass inhibitors targeting MSPL and DESC1.

Title: Influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) replicates efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cynomolgus macaques.
Abstract: In March 2013, three fatal human cases of infection with influenza A virus (H7N9) were reported in China. Since then, human cases have been accumulating. Given the public health importance of this virus, we performed a pathogenicity study of the H7N9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model, focusing on clinical aspects of disease, radiographic, histological, and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed transient, mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration. Virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract, with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation. Virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat. Histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans, albeit less severe, with diffuse alveolar damage, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, formation of hyaline membranes, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibroproliferative changes. Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during H7N9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication. Overall, H7N9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans, supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human H7N9 infection (H. N. Gao et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 368:2277-2285, 2013, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1305584). Influenza A virus H7N9 emerged early in 2013, and human cases have continued to emerge since then. Although H7N9 virus-induced disease in humans is often very severe and even lethal, the majority of reported H7N9 cases occurred in older people and people with underlying medical conditions. To better understand the pathogenicity of this virus, healthy cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with influenza A virus H7N9. Cynomolgus macaques were used as a model because the receptor distribution for H7N9 virus in macaques was recently shown to be more similar to that in humans than that of other frequently used animal models. From comparison with previous studies, we conclude that the emerging H7N9 influenza virus was more pathogenic in cynomolgus macaques than seasonal influenza A viruses and most isolates of the pandemic H1N1 virus but less pathogenic than the 1918 Spanish influenza virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus.

Title: Adaptive evolution and environmental durability jointly structure phylodynamic patterns in avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been pivotal to the origination of human pandemic strains. Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses-a manifestation of the "storage effect"-highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.

Title: Protection from pulmonary tissue damage associated with infection of cynomolgus macaques by highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) by low dose natural human IFN-α administered to the buccal mucosa.
Abstract: Using an established nonhuman primate model for H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in humans, we have been able to demonstrate the prophylactic mitigation of the pulmonary damage characteristic of human fatal cases from primary influenza virus pneumonia with a low dose oral formulation of a commercially available parenteral natural human interferon alpha (Alferon N Injection®). At the highest oral dose (62.5IU/kg body weight) used there was a marked reduction in the alveolar inflammatory response with minor evidence of alveolar and interstitial edema in contrast to the hemorrhage and inflammatory response observed in the alveoli of control animals. The mitigation of severe damage to the lower pulmonary airway was observed without a parallel reduction in viral titers. Clinical trial data will be necessary to establish its prophylactic human efficacy for highly pathogenic influenza viruses.

Title: Glycan receptor specificity as a useful tool for characterization and surveillance of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens with the potential for novel strains to emerge and result in pandemic outbreaks in humans. Some avian-adapted subtypes have acquired the ability to bind to human glycan receptors and cause severe infections in humans but have yet to adapt to and transmit between humans. The emergence of new avian strains and their ability to infect humans has confounded their distinction from circulating human virus strains through linking receptor specificity to human adaptation. Herein we review the various structural and biochemical analyses of influenza hemagglutinin-glycan receptor interactions. We provide our perspectives on how receptor specificity can be used to monitor evolution of the virus to adapt to human hosts so as to facilitate improved surveillance and pandemic preparedness.

Title: Multiplex evaluation of influenza neutralizing antibodies with potential applicability to in-field serological studies.
Abstract: The increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 LPAI and HPAI viruses in poultry has major public and animal health implications. The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. We propose that this robust assay may have practical utility for in-field serosurveillance and vaccine studies in resource-limited regions worldwide.

Title: The CCR5Δ32 allele is not a major predisposing factor for severe H1N1pdm09 infection.
Abstract: Host genetic factors are thought to modulated the severity of disease caused by infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm09). The human CCR5 gene encodes a cytokine receptor important for cell-mediated immune response against H1N1pdm09. A 32-bp polymorphic deletion in the coding sequence of CCR5, the so-called CCR5Δ32 allele, segregates in populations of European ancestry with a frequency of 8-15%. A high proportion of CCR5Δ32 heterozygotes was reported in a sample of white Canadian critically-ill H1N1pdm09 infected subjects, suggesting an association with disease severity. We recruited 29 H1N1pdm09 infected subjects from Southern Europe (mostly Italians) with a wide clinical spectrum of disease symptoms; the sample included 7 subjects who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The CCR5Δ32 variant was genotyped in all subjects. The CCR5Δ32 allele was found in one single subject, who developed a very mild form and was not hospitalized. The CCR5Δ32 allele was not found to be associated with the risk of H1N1pdm09 infection or with a severe disease course.

Title: Influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance in one hospital in Medellin, Colombia. 2007-2012.
Abstract: The city of Medellin in Colombia has almost no documentation of the causes of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). As part of an ongoing collaboration, we conducted an epidemiologic surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses. It described the influenza strains that were circulating in the region along with their distribution over time, and performing molecular characterization to some of those strains. This will contribute to the knowledge of local and national epidemiology. To analyze viral etiologic agents associated with influenza like illness (ILI) in participants reporting to one General hospital in Medelllin, Colombia. From January 2007 to December 2012, a total of 2039 participants were enrolled. Among them, 1120 (54.9%) were male and 1364 (69%) were under the age of five. Only 124 (6%) were older than the age of 15. From all 2039 participants, 1040 samples were diagnosed by either isolation or RT-PCR. One or more respiratory viruses were found in 737 (36%) participants. Of those, 426 (57.8%) got influenza A or B. Adenoviral and parainfluenza infections represented 19.1% and 14.9% of viral infections, respectively. Influenza A was detected almost throughout the whole year except for the first quarter of 2010, right after the 2009 influenza A pandemic. Influenza B was detected in 2008, 2010, and 2012 with no pattern detected. During 2008 and 2010, both types circulated in about the same proportion. Unusually, in many months of 2012, the proportion of influenza B infections was higher than influenza A (ranging between 30% and 42%). The higher proportion of adenovirus was mainly detected in the last quarter of years 2007 and 2010. Adenoviral cases are more frequent in participants under the age of four. The phylogenetic analysis of influenza viruses shows that only in the case of influenza A/H1N1, the circulating strains totally coincide with the vaccine strains each year.

Title: Development and clinical testing of a simple, low-density gel element array for influenza identification, subtyping, and H275Y detection.
Abstract: The objectives of this study were to develop a user-friendly, gel element microarray test for influenza virus detection, subtyping, and neuraminidase inhibitor resistance detection, assess the performance characteristics of the assay, and perform a clinical evaluation on retrospective nasopharyngeal swab specimens. A streamlined microarray workflow enabled a single user to run up to 24 tests in an 8h shift. The most sensitive components of the test were the primers and probes targeting the A/H1 pdm09 HA gene with an analytical limit of detection (LoD) <100 gene copies (gc) per reaction. LoDs for all targets in nasopharyngeal swab samples were ≤1000 gc, with the exception of one target in the seasonal A/H1N1 subtype. Seasonal H275Y variants were detectable in a mixed population when present at >5% with wild type virus, while the 2009 pandemic H1N1 H275Y variant was detectable at ≤1% in a mixture with pandemic wild type virus. Influenza typing and subtyping results concurred with those obtained with real-time RT-PCR assays on more than 97% of the samples tested. The results demonstrate that a large panel of single-plex, real-time RT-PCR tests can be translated to an easy-to-use, sensitive, and specific microarray test for potential diagnostic use.

Title: Global update on the susceptibility of human influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors, 2012-2013.
Abstract: Emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) is sporadic, often follows exposure to NAIs, but occasionally occurs in the absence of NAI pressure. The emergence and global spread in 2007/2008 of A(H1N1) influenza viruses showing clinical resistance to oseltamivir due to neuraminidase (NA) H275Y substitution, in the absence of drug pressure, warrants continued vigilance and monitoring for similar viruses. Four World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and one WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza (WHO CCs) tested 11,387 viruses collected by WHO-recognized National Influenza Centres (NIC) between May 2012 and May 2013 to determine 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) data for oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir. The data were evaluated using normalized IC50 fold-changes rather than raw IC50 data. Nearly 90% of the 11,387 viruses were from three WHO regions: Western Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Only 0.2% (n=27) showed highly reduced inhibition (HRI) against at least one of the four NAIs, usually oseltamivir, while 0.3% (n=39) showed reduced inhibition (RI). NA sequence data, available from the WHO CCs and from sequence databases (n=3661), were screened for amino acid substitutions associated with reduced NAI susceptibility. Those showing HRI were A(H1N1)pdm09 with NA H275Y (n=18), A(H3N2) with NA E119V (n=3) or NA R292K (n=1) and B/Victoria-lineage with NA H273Y (n=2); amino acid position numbering is A subtype and B type specific. Overall, approximately 99% of circulating viruses tested during the 2012-2013 period were sensitive to all four NAIs. Consequently, these drugs remain an appropriate choice for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports surveillance data on neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond resistance detection.

Title: Ectopic trypsin in the myocardium promotes dilated cardiomyopathy after influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: We have previously reported that ectopic trypsin in the myocardium triggers acute myocarditis after influenza A virus (IAV) infection. As myocarditis is a common precursor to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of trypsin on the progression of DCM after IAV infection. IAV-infected mice treated with saline or trypsin inhibitor were euthanized on days 0, 9, 20, 40 and 60 postinfection. Trypsin expression colocalized with myocardial inflammatory loci and IAV-induced myocarditis peaked on day 9 postinfection and alleviated by day 20 but persisted until day 60 postinfection, even though replication of IAV was not detected from day 20 postinfection. Similar time courses were observed for the activation of pro-matrix metalloproteinase (pro-MMP)-9 and expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Degradation of collagen type I, proliferation of ventricular interstitial collagen, and expression of collagen type I and III mRNA increased significantly during acute and chronic phases; collagen type III mRNA increased more significantly than collagen type I mRNA. Cardiac function progressively deteriorated with progressive left ventricular dilation. The trypsin inhibitor aprotinin suppressed pro-MMP-9 activation and cytokine release, alleviated myocardial inflammation, and restored collagen metabolism during acute and chronic phases of myocarditis. This effectively prevented ventricular dilation and improved cardiac function. These results suggest that ectopic trypsin in the myocardium promoted DCM through chronic activation of pro-MMP-9, persistent induction of cytokines, and mediation of collagen remodeling. Pharmacological inhibition of trypsin activity might be a promising approach for the prevention of viral cardiomyopathy.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of ectopic trypsin in myocardium promoting dilated cardiomyopathy after influenza A virus infection, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Annexin V incorporated into influenza virus particles inhibits gamma interferon signaling and promotes viral replication.
Abstract: During the budding process, influenza A viruses (IAVs) incorporate multiple host cell membrane proteins. However, for most of them, their significance in viral morphogenesis and infectivity remains unknown. We demonstrate here that the expression of annexin V (A5) is upregulated at the cell surface upon IAV infection and that a substantial proportion of the protein is present in lipid rafts, the site of virus budding. Western blotting and immunogold analysis of highly purified IAV particles showed the presence of A5 in the virion. Significantly, gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-induced Stat phosphorylation and IFN-γ-induced 10-kDa protein (IP-10) production in macrophage-derived THP-1 cells was inhibited by purified IAV particles. Disruption of the IFN-γ signaling pathway was A5 dependent since downregulation of its expression or its blockage reversed the inhibition and resulted in decreased viral replication in vitro. The functional significance of these results was also observed in vivo. Thus, IAVs can subvert the IFN-γ antiviral immune response by incorporating A5 into their envelope during the budding process. Many enveloped viruses, including influenza A viruses, bud from the plasma membrane of their host cells and incorporate cellular surface proteins into viral particles. However, for the vast majority of these proteins, only the observation of their incorporation has been reported. We demonstrate here that the host protein annexin V is specifically incorporated into influenza virus particles during the budding process. Importantly, we showed that packaged annexin V counteracted the antiviral activity of gamma interferon in vitro and in vivo. Thus, these results showed that annexin V incorporated in the viral envelope of influenza viruses allow viral escape from immune surveillance. Understanding the role of host incorporated protein into virions may reveal how enveloped RNA viruses hijack the host cell machinery for their own purposes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines the incorporation of host protein annexin V into influenza virus particles and its effect on immune signaling and viral replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prolidase is required for early trafficking events during influenza A virus entry.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) entry is a multistep process that requires the interaction of the virus with numerous host factors. In this study, we demonstrate that prolidase (PEPD) is a cellular factor required by IAV for successful entry into target cells. PEPD was selected as a candidate during an entry screen performed on nonvalidated primary hits from previously published genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. siRNA-mediated depletion of PEPD resulted in the decreased growth of IAV during mono- and multicycle growth. This growth defect was independent of cell type or virus strain. Furthermore, IAV restriction was apparent as early as 3 h postinfection, and experiments in the absence of protein biosynthesis revealed that the nuclear import of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) was already blocked in the absence of PEPD. These results led us to investigate which step during entry was affected. Receptor expression, IAV attachment, or IAV internalization was not dependent on the presence of PEPD. However, when looking at the distribution of incoming IAV particles in PEPD-knockdown cells, we found a localization pattern that differed from that in control cells: IAV mostly localized to the cell periphery, and consequently, viral particles displayed reduced colocalization with early and late endosome markers and fusion between viral and endosomal membranes was strongly reduced. Finally, experiments using a competitive inhibitor of PEPD catalytic activity suggested that the enzymatic function of the dipeptidase is required for its proviral effect on IAV entry. In sum, this study establishes PEPD as a novel entry factor required for early endosomal trafficking of IAV. Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a constant threat to public health. As IAV relies on its host cell for replication, the identification of host factors required by the virus is of importance. First, such studies often reveal novel functions of cellular factors and can extend our knowledge of cellular processes. Second, we can further our understanding of processes that are required for the entry of IAV into target cells. Third, the identification of host factors that contribute to IAV entry will increase the number of potential targets for the development of novel antiviral drugs that are of urgent need. Our study identifies prolidase (PEPD) to be a novel entry factor required by IAV for correct routing within the endosomal compartment following virus internalization. Thereby, we link PEPD, which has been shown to play a role during collagen recycling and growth factor signaling, to early events of viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies a host factor (prolidase) required for influenza A virus entry, focusing on host-virus interactions rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Histone deacetylase 6 inhibits influenza A virus release by downregulating the trafficking of viral components to the plasma membrane via its substrate, acetylated microtubules.
Abstract: Mammalian cells produce many proteins, such as IFITM3, ISG15, MxA, and viperin, that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we show that a new class of host protein, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), inhibits IAV infection. We found that HDAC6-overexpressing cells release about 3-fold less IAV progeny, whereas HDAC6-depleted cells release about 6-fold more IAV progeny. The deacetylase activity of HDAC6 played a role in its anti-IAV function as tubacin, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of HDAC6, increased the release of IAV progeny in a dose-dependent manner. Further, as visualized by electron microscopy, tubacin-treated cells showed an increase in IAV budding at the plasma membrane, the site of IAV assembly. Tubacin is a domain-specific inhibitor and binds to one of the two HDAC6 catalytic domains possessing tubulin deacetylase activity. This indicated the potential involvement of acetylated microtubules in the trafficking of viral components to the plasma membrane. Indeed, as quantified by flow cytometry, there was about a 2.0- to 2.5-fold increase and about a 2.0-fold decrease in the amount of viral envelope protein hemagglutinin present on the plasma membrane of tubacin-treated/HDAC6-depleted and HDAC6-overexpressing cells, respectively. In addition, the viral ribonucleoprotein complex was colocalized with acetylated microtubule filaments, and viral nucleoprotein coimmunoprecipitated with acetylated tubulin. Together, our findings indicate that HDAC6 is an anti-IAV host factor and exerts its anti-IAV function by negatively regulating the trafficking of viral components to the host cell plasma membrane via its substrate, acetylated microtubules. Host cells produce many proteins that have the natural ability to restrict influenza virus infection. Here, we discovered that another host protein, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), inhibits influenza virus infection. We demonstrate that HDAC6 exerts its anti-influenza virus function by negatively regulating the trafficking of viral components to the site of influenza virus assembly via its substrate, acetylated microtubules. HDAC6 is a multisubstrate enzyme and regulates multiple cellular pathways, including the ones leading to various cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory disorders. Therefore, several drugs targeting HDAC6 are under clinical development for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Influenza virus continues to be a major global public health problem due to regular emergence of drug-resistant and novel influenza virus strains in humans. As an alternative antiviral strategy, HDAC6 modulators could be employed to stimulate the anti-influenza virus potential of endogenous HDAC6 to inhibit influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of host protein HDAC6 in inhibiting influenza A virus release, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of H7N9 avian influenza virus based on a novel mathematical descriptor.
Abstract: A new mathematical descriptor was proposed based on 3D graphical representation. Using the method, we construct the phylogenetic trees of nine proteins of H7N9 influenza virus to analyze the originated source of H7N9. The results show that the evolution route of H7N9 avian influenza is from America through Europe to Asia. Furthermore, two samples collected from environment in Nanjing and Zhejiang and one sample collected from chicken are the sources of H7N9 influenza virus that infected human in China.

Title: Influenza a virus host shutoff disables antiviral stress-induced translation arrest.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase complexes function in the nucleus of infected cells, generating mRNAs that bear 5' caps and poly(A) tails, and which are exported to the cytoplasm and translated by host machinery. Host antiviral defences include mechanisms that detect the stress of virus infection and arrest cap-dependent mRNA translation, which normally results in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of translationally stalled mRNA-protein complexes known as stress granules (SGs). It remains unclear how IAV ensures preferential translation of viral gene products while evading stress-induced translation arrest. Here, we demonstrate that at early stages of infection both viral and host mRNAs are sensitive to drug-induced translation arrest and SG formation. By contrast, at later stages of infection, IAV becomes partially resistant to stress-induced translation arrest, thereby maintaining ongoing translation of viral gene products. To this end, the virus deploys multiple proteins that block stress-induced SG formation: 1) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) inactivates the antiviral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated kinase PKR, thereby preventing eIF2α phosphorylation and SG formation; 2) nucleoprotein (NP) inhibits SG formation without affecting eIF2α phosphorylation; 3) host-shutoff protein polymerase-acidic protein-X (PA-X) strongly inhibits SG formation concomitant with dramatic depletion of cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA and nuclear accumulation of poly(A)-binding protein. Recombinant viruses with disrupted PA-X host shutoff function fail to effectively inhibit stress-induced SG formation. The existence of three distinct mechanisms of IAV-mediated SG blockade reveals the magnitude of the threat of stress-induced translation arrest during viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates influenza A virus host shutoff mechanisms and stress granule formation, focusing on viral protein functions rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Glycan based detection and drug susceptibility of influenza virus.
Abstract: We have developed a panel of synthetic glycans as receptor mimics for the specific capture of influenza viruses. The glycans were printed onto commercial glass slides using a free amine at the end of a spacer to generate a small focused microarray. The microarray was evaluated for its ability to capture three different strains of influenza A virus, two H1N1, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and one H3N2, A/Aichi/2/1968. We observed an excellent detection ability with some compounds exhibiting clinically relevant (10(1) plaque forming units) limit of detection. We also tested the drug susceptibility of current antivirals, Zanamivir and Ostelamivir using this microarray and could determine antiviral resistance for these strains.

Title: Limited human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, Shanghai, China, March to April 2013.
Abstract: In April 2013, two members of one family were successively confirmed as cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in Shanghai, China. Respiratory specimens from the two cases and their close contacts were tested using real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR. Paired serum specimens from contacts were tested by haemagglutination inhibition assay and microneutralisation test. The index patient developed severe pneumonia. Her husband presented with pneumonia shortly thereafter. Both cases had highly similar clinical features and infection with A(H7N9) virus was confirmed in both cases by genetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high level of similarity between the sequences from the two patients and environmental samples collected from wet markets in Minhang and Changning districts. Six samples from the Changning wet market were confirmed as A(H7N9) positive. Of 27 close contacts, one developed mild respiratory symptoms and another tested positive for A(H7N9) antibodies, but both were negative by real-time RT-PCR. The other 25 close contacts of both cases were A(H7N9) negative. Limited human-to-human transmission of the virus most likely occurred in the family cluster. However, other close contacts did not test positive for the virus, suggesting limited potential for extensive human-to-human transmission of the virus.

Title: Transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from father to child: a report of limited person-to-person transmission, Guangzhou, China, January 2014.
Abstract: We investigated a possible person-to-person transmission within a family cluster of two confirmed influenza A(H7N9) patients in Guangzhou, China. The index case, a man in his late twenties, worked in a wet market that was confirmed to be contaminated by the influenza A(H7N9) virus. He developed a consistent fever and severe pneumonia after 4 January 2014. In contrast, the second case, his five-year-old child, who only developed a mild disease 10 days after disease onset of the index case, did not have any contact with poultry and birds but had unprotected and very close contact with the index case. The sequences of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of the virus stains isolated from the two cases were 100% identical. These findings strongly suggest that the second case might have acquired the infection via transmission of the virus from the sick father. Fortunately, all 40 close contacts, including the other four family members who also had unprotected and very close contact with the cases, did not acquire influenza A(H7N9) virus infection, indicating that the person-to-person transmissibility of the virus remained limited. Our finding underlines the importance of carefully, thoroughly and punctually following-up close contacts of influenza A(H7N9) cases to allow detection of any secondary cases, as these may constitute an early warning signal of the virus's increasing ability to transmit from person-to-person.
Relevant: False

Title: Verdinexor, a novel selective inhibitor of nuclear export, reduces influenza a virus replication in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza is a global health concern, causing death, morbidity, and economic losses. Chemotherapeutics that target influenza virus are available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains is common. Therapeutic targeting of host proteins hijacked by influenza virus to facilitate replication is an antiviral strategy to reduce the development of drug resistance. Nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) from infected cells has been shown to be mediated by exportin 1 (XPO1) interaction with viral nuclear export protein tethered to vRNP. RNA interference screening has identified XPO1 as a host proinfluenza factor where XPO1 silencing results in reduced influenza virus replication. The Streptomyces metabolite XPO1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) has been shown to limit influenza virus replication in vitro; however, LMB is toxic in vivo, which makes it unsuitable for therapeutic use. In this study, we tested the anti-influenza virus activity of a new class of orally available small-molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export, specifically, the XPO1 antagonist KPT-335 (verdinexor). Verdinexor was shown to potently and selectively inhibit vRNP export and effectively inhibited the replication of various influenza virus A and B strains in vitro, including pandemic H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, and the recently emerged H7N9 strain. In vivo, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of verdinexor protected mice against disease pathology following a challenge with influenza virus A/California/04/09 or A/Philippines/2/82-X79, as well as reduced lung viral loads and proinflammatory cytokine expression, while having minimal toxicity. These studies show that verdinexor acts as a novel anti-influenza virus therapeutic agent. Antiviral drugs represent important means of influenza virus control. However, substantial resistance to currently approved influenza therapeutic drugs has developed. New antiviral approaches are required to address drug resistance and reduce the burden of influenza virus-related disease. This study addressed critical preclinical studies for the development of verdinexor (KPT-335) as a novel antiviral drug. Verdinexor blocks progeny influenza virus genome nuclear export, thus effectively inhibiting virus replication. Verdinexor was found to limit the replication of various strains of influenza A and B viruses, including a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain, a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus strain, and a recently emerging H7N9 influenza virus strain. Importantly, oral verdinexor treatments, given prophylactically or therapeutically, were efficacious in limiting lung virus burdens in influenza virus-infected mice, in addition to limiting lung proinflammatory cytokine expression, pathology, and death. Thus, this study demonstrated that verdinexor is efficacious against influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo.

Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral activity of verdinexor against various influenza strains but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and B viruses in the tropical city of Managua, Nicaragua.
Abstract: Despite mounting evidence of the high disease burden of influenza in tropical regions, relatively little viral sequence data is available from tropical countries in the Western hemisphere. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and B viruses in Managua, Nicaragua, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 1956 influenza viruses, including 335 collected for this study during 2007-2010 from a population-based cohort in Managua. North America was consistently identified as the most significant source of influenza virus diversity in Managua, although South America and Mexico were important viral sources during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The low number of viral introductions of Central American origin may reflect differences in the seasonality of influenza in Nicaragua versus neighboring countries, and underscores the need for additional data in this understudied region.

Title: Epidemiology and viral etiology of the influenza-like illness in corsica during the 2012-2013 Winter: an analysis of several sentinel surveillance systems.
Abstract: Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is important to identify circulating and emerging/reemerging strains and unusual epidemiological trends. The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (<15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.

Title: Mucosal polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid improves protection elicited by replicating influenza vaccines via enhanced dendritic cell function and T cell immunity.
Abstract: Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have the potential to generate CD8 T cell immunity that may limit the virulence of an antigenically shifted influenza strain in a population lacking protective Abs. However, current LAIVs exert limited T cell immunity restricted to the vaccine strains. One approach to improve LAIV-induced T cell responses is the use of specific adjuvants to enhance T cell priming by respiratory dendritic cells, but this hypothesis has not been addressed. In this study, we assessed the effect of the TLR3 ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC) on CD8 T cell immunity and protection elicited by LAIVs. Mucosal treatment with poly IC shortly after vaccination enhanced respiratory dendritic cell function, CD8 T cell formation, and production of neutralizing Abs. This adjuvant effect of poly IC was dependent on amplification of TLR3 signaling by nonhematopoietic radioresistant cells and enhanced mouse protection to homosubtypic, as well as heterosubtypic, virus challenge. Our findings indicate that mucosal TLR3 ligation may be used to improve CD8 T cell responses to replicating vaccines, which has implications for protection in the absence of pre-existing Ab immunity.

Title: Response of mice and ferrets to a monovalent influenza A (H7N9) split vaccine.
Abstract: In early spring 2013, the emergence of the influenza A (H7N9) virus in humans in Eastern China raised concerns of a new influenza pandemic. Development of a safe and effective H7N9 influenza vaccine is urgently needed. To this end, we first synthesized the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the influenza A (H7N9) virus A/AnHui/1/2013. Using reverse genetics, we rescued a reassortant virus (H7N9/PR8) that contained the HA and NA genes from wild-type H7N9 and six genes encoding internal proteins from the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus. Next, the pathogenicity of the reassortant virus was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. We found that the virus was non-pathogenic in mice and was stable after serial passaging in eggs. Furthermore, we found that a monovalent influenza A (H7N9) split vaccine prepared from the virus was immunogenic in mice and ferrets. When given intramuscularly, the vaccine (two doses of at least 15-µg) completely protected mice from normally lethal wild-type H7N9 virus challenge. In summary, our H7N9 vaccine, developed over a short time, is a potential candidate for further clinical evaluation and human use.

Title: Influence of elastin-like polypeptide and hydrophobin on recombinant hemagglutinin accumulations in transgenic tobacco plants.
Abstract: Fusion protein strategies are useful tools to enhance expression and to support the development of purification technologies. The capacity of fusion protein strategies to enhance expression was explored in tobacco leaves and seeds. C-terminal fusion of elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) to influenza hemagglutinin under the control of either the constitutive CaMV 35S or the seed-specific USP promoter resulted in increased accumulation in both leaves and seeds compared to the unfused hemagglutinin. The addition of a hydrophobin to the C-terminal end of hemagglutinin did not significantly increase the expression level. We show here that, depending on the target protein, both hydrophobin fusion and ELPylation combined with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting induced protein bodies in leaves as well as in seeds. The N-glycosylation pattern indicated that KDEL sequence-mediated retention of leaf-derived hemagglutinins and hemagglutinin-hydrophobin fusions were not completely retained in the ER. In contrast, hemagglutinin-ELP from leaves contained only the oligomannose form, suggesting complete ER retention. In seeds, ER retention seems to be nearly complete for all three constructs. An easy and scalable purification method for ELPylated proteins using membrane-based inverse transition cycling could be applied to both leaf- and seed-expressed hemagglutinins.

Title: Diffusion of influenza viruses among migratory birds with a focus on the Southwest United States.
Abstract: The Southwest United States, including Arizona and New Mexico, has a diverse climate and is home to many different avian species. We sequenced the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of twenty influenza specimens for the years 2007-2009. This included four from Arizona, and sixteen from New Mexico. We analyzed the sequences and determined the following HA subtypes: H3, H4, H6, H8, and H11. For each subtype, we combined our virus sequences with those from a public database, and inferred phylogeographic models of influenza diffusion. Statistical phylogeography indicated that overall evolutionary diffusion of avian influenza viruses is geographically structured (p<0.05). In addition, we found that diffusion to the Southwest was often from nearby states including California. For H3, H4 and H6, the intra-flyway gene flow rates were significantly (p<0.001) higher than those of inter-flyway. Such rate difference was also observed in H8 and H11, yet, without statistical significance (p=0.132, p=0.190, respectively). Excluding any one flyway from the calculation generated similar results, suggesting that such barrier effect on gene flow rates is not exclusively produced by any single flyway. We also calculated the Bayes factor test for the significant non-zero rates between states and identified significant routes both within and across flyways. Such inter-flyway spread of influenza was probably the result of birds from four flyways co-mingling on breeding grounds in northern regions or marshaling on staging areas post breeding in Canada or Alaska, before moving south each fall. This study provides an initial analysis of evolutionary diffusion of avian influenza virus to and from the Southwest United States. However, more sequences from this region need to be generated to determine the role of host migration and other factors on influenza diffusion.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on diffusion and phylogeography of influenza viruses among migratory birds, analyzing HA gene sequences and geographic spread, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Oncolytic activity of avian influenza virus in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the most lethal form of human cancer, with dismal survival rates due to late-stage diagnoses and a lack of efficacious therapies. Building on the observation that avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a tropism for the pancreas in vivo, the present study was aimed at testing the efficacy of IAVs as oncolytic agents for killing human PDA cell lines. Receptor characterization confirmed that human PDA cell lines express the alpha-2,3- and the alpha-2,6-linked glycan receptor for avian and human IAVs, respectively. PDA cell lines were sensitive to infection by human and avian IAV isolates, which is consistent with this finding. Growth kinetic experiments showed preferential virus replication in PDA cells over that in a nontransformed pancreatic ductal cell line. Finally, at early time points posttreatment, infection with IAVs caused higher levels of apoptosis in PDA cells than gemcitabine and cisplatin, which are the cornerstone of current therapies for PDA. In the BxPC-3 PDA cell line, apoptosis resulted from the engagement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Importantly, IAVs did not induce apoptosis in nontransformed pancreatic ductal HPDE6 cells. Using a model based on the growth of a PDA cell line as a xenograft in SCID mice, we also show that a slightly pathogenic avian IAV significantly inhibited tumor growth following intratumoral injection. Taken together, these results are the first to suggest that IAVs may hold promise as future agents of oncolytic virotherapy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Despite intensive studies aimed at designing new therapeutic approaches, PDA still retains the most dismal prognosis among human cancers. In the present study, we provide the first evidence indicating that avian IAVs of low pathogenicity display a tropism for human PDA cells, resulting in viral RNA replication and a potent induction of apoptosis in vitro and antitumor effects in vivo. These results suggest that slightly pathogenic IAVs may prove to be effective for oncolytic virotherapy of PDA and provide grounds for further studies to develop specific and targeted viruses, with the aim of testing their efficacy in clinical contexts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the oncolytic activity of avian influenza viruses in human pancreatic cancer cells, focusing on virus tropism and apoptosis induction, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Trade-offs between and within scales: environmental persistence and within-host fitness of avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication and transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies have identified trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting the tension between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation and large-scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical in nature, with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs still rare. Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses across scales, focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent viral persistence. Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports both environmental virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics from duck challenge experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent environmental decay rate of a strain does not impact within-host virus load. Hence, for this phenotype, the scales of within-host infection dynamics and between-host environmental persistence do not seem to interact: viral fitness may be optimized on each scale without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we confirm the existence of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on a single scale, with some strains favouring environmental persistence in water at low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing temperatures. We show that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a robust phenomenon and does not depend on the details of data analysis. Our findings suggest that viruses might employ different environmental persistence strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse strains in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined ecological and within-host framework.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes environmental persistence and within-host fitness of avian influenza viruses, focusing on phenotypic traits across scales but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Nucleotide oligomerization and binding domain 2-dependent dendritic cell activation is necessary for innate immunity and optimal CD8+ T Cell responses to influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Nucleotide oligomerization and binding domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are important in the innate immune response to viral infection. Recent findings have implicated NLRP3, NOD2, and NLRX1 as important players in the innate antiviral response, but their roles in the generation of adaptive immunity to viruses are less clear. We demonstrate here that NOD2 is critical for both innate and adaptive immune responses necessary for controlling viral replication and survival during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Nod2(-/-) mice have reduced beta interferon (IFN-β) levels and fewer activated dendritic cells (DCs), and the DCs are more prone to cell death in the lungs of Nod2(-/-) mice during IAV infection. In agreement with the role for DCs in priming adaptive immunity, the generation of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and their activation and production of IFN-γ were lower in Nod2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Nod2(-/-) DCs, when cocultured with T cells in vitro, have a lower costimulatory capacity. Thus, Nod2(-/-) DCs are unable to efficiently prime CD8(+) T cells. These findings demonstrate that Nod2 is critical for the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses necessary for controlling IAV infection. The innate immune system is the host's first line of defense against invading pathogens and is also necessary for alerting and activating T and B cells to initiate the adaptive immune response. We demonstrate here that the innate immune receptor NOD2 is required for the production of antiviral type I interferons and the activation and survival of dendritic cells that, in turn, alert T cells to the presence of influenza A virus infection. In mice that are missing NOD2, interferon levels are lower, and the CD8(+) T cell response is impaired. As a result, the animals cannot control virus replication in their lungs as efficiently. This discovery helps us understand how the body naturally responds to virus infection and may help in the development of vaccines that use NOD2 to stimulate the CD8(+) T cell response, thus providing better protection against influenza A virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of host innate immune receptors (NOD2) in immune response to influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Lipidomics identifies a requirement for peroxisomal function during influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus acquires a host-derived lipid envelope during budding, yet a convergent view on the role of host lipid metabolism during infection is lacking. Using a mass spectrometry-based lipidomics approach, we provide a systems-scale perspective on membrane lipid dynamics of infected human lung epithelial cells and purified influenza virions. We reveal enrichment of the minor peroxisome-derived ether-linked phosphatidylcholines relative to bulk ester-linked phosphatidylcholines in virions as a unique pathogenicity-dependent signature for influenza not found in other enveloped viruses. Strikingly, pharmacological and genetic interference with peroxisomal and ether lipid metabolism impaired influenza virus production. Further integration of our lipidomics results with published genomics and proteomics data corroborated altered peroxisomal lipid metabolism as a hallmark of influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo. Influenza virus may therefore tailor peroxisomal and particularly ether lipid metabolism for efficient replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates host lipid metabolism during influenza virus replication, focusing on host factors rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: An ENU-induced splicing mutation reveals a role for Unc93b1 in early immune cell activation following influenza A H1N1 infection.
Abstract: Genetic and immunological analysis of host-pathogen interactions can reveal fundamental mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to infection. Modeling human infectious diseases among inbred mouse strains is a proven approach but is limited by naturally occurring genetic diversity. Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we created a recessive loss-of-function point mutation in Unc93b1 (unc-93 homolog B1 (C. elegans)), a chaperone for endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR9, which we termed Letr for 'loss of endosomal TLR response'. We used Unc93b1(Letr/Letr) mice to study the role of Unc93b1 in the immune response to influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), an important global respiratory pathogen. During the early phase of infection, Unc93b1(Letr/Letr) mice had fewer activated exudate macrophages and decreased expression of CXCL10, interferon (IFN)-γ and type I IFN. Mutation of Unc93b1 also led to reduced expression of the CD69 activation marker and a concomitant increase in the CD62L naive marker on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in infected lungs. Finally, loss of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in delayed viral clearance that coincided with increased tissue pathology during infection. Taken together, these findings establish a role for Unc93b1 and endosomal TLRs in the activation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells during the innate immune response to influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies a host gene mutation affecting immune response to influenza infection, focusing on host genetics and immune activation rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Shotgun glycomics of pig lung identifies natural endogenous receptors for influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza viruses bind to host cell surface glycans containing terminal sialic acids, but as studies on influenza binding become more sophisticated, it is becoming evident that although sialic acid may be necessary, it is not sufficient for productive binding. To better define endogenous glycans that serve as viral receptors, we have explored glycan recognition in the pig lung, because influenza is broadly disseminated in swine, and swine have been postulated as an intermediary host for the emergence of pandemic strains. For these studies, we used the technology of "shotgun glycomics" to identify natural receptor glycans. The total released N- and O-glycans from pig lung glycoproteins and glycolipid-derived glycans were fluorescently tagged and separated by multidimensional HPLC, and individual glycans were covalently printed to generate pig lung shotgun glycan microarrays. All viruses tested interacted with one or more sialylated N-glycans but not O-glycans or glycolipid-derived glycans, and each virus demonstrated novel and unexpected differences in endogenous N-glycan recognition. The results illustrate the repertoire of specific, endogenous N-glycans of pig lung glycoproteins for virus recognition and offer a new direction for studying endogenous glycan functions in viral pathogenesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies natural endogenous glycan receptors for influenza viruses in pig lung, focusing on host glycans and viral binding but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus-induced degradation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B contributes to viral replication by suppressing IFITM3 protein expression.
Abstract: Although alteration in host cellular translation machinery occurs in virus-infected cells, the role of such alteration and the precise pathogenic processes are not well understood. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection shuts off host cell gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we found that the protein level of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), an integral component of the translation initiation apparatus, was dramatically reduced in A549 cells as well as in the lung, spleen, and thymus of mice infected with IAV. The decrease in eIF4B level was attributed to lysosomal degradation of eIF4B, which was induced by viral NS1 protein. Silencing eIF4B expression in A549 cells significantly promoted IAV replication, and conversely, overexpression of eIF4B markedly inhibited the viral replication. Importantly, we observed that eIF4B knockdown transgenic mice were more susceptible to IAV infection, exhibiting faster weight loss, shorter survival time, and more-severe organ damage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eIF4B regulated the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a critical protein involved in immune defense against a variety of RNA viruses, including influenza virus. Taken together, our findings reveal that eIF4B plays an important role in host defense against IAV infection at least by regulating the expression of IFITM3, which restricts viral entry and thereby blocks early stages of viral production. These data also indicate that influenza virus has evolved a strategy to overcome host innate immunity by downregulating eIF4B protein. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection stimulates the host innate immune system, in part, by inducing interferons (IFNs). Secreted IFNs activate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, leading to elevated transcription of a large group of IFN-stimulated genes that have antiviral function. To circumvent the host innate immune response, influenza virus has evolved multiple strategies for suppressing the production of IFNs. Here, we show that IAV infection induces lysosomal degradation of eIF4B protein; and eIF4B inhibits IAV replication by upregulating expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a key protein that protects the host from virus infection. Our finding illustrates a critical role of eIF4B in the host innate immune response and provides novel insights into the complex mechanisms by which influenza virus interacts with its host.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host protein eIF4B's role in viral replication and host immune response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Importin-α7 is required for enhanced influenza A virus replication in the alveolar epithelium and severe lung damage in mice.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses recruit components of the nuclear import pathway to enter the host cell nucleus and promote viral replication. Here, we analyzed the role of the nuclear import factor importin-α7 in H1N1 influenza virus pulmonary tropism by using various ex vivo imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and correlative light-electron microscopy). We infected importin-α7 gene-deficient (α7(-/-)) mice with a recombinant H1N1 influenza virus and compared the in vivo viral kinetics with those in wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, influenza virus replication in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium already occurred a few days after infection. Accordingly, extensive mononuclear infiltration and alveolar destruction were present in the lungs of infected WT mice, followed by 100% lethality. Conversely, in α7(-/-) mice, virus replication was restricted mostly to the bronchial epithelium with marginal alveolar infection, resulting in significantly reduced lung damage and enhanced animal survival. To investigate the host immune response during alveolar virus replication, we studied the role of primary macrophages in virus propagation and clearance. The ability of macrophages to support or clear the virus infection, as well as the host cellular immune responses, did not significantly differ between WT and α7(-/-) mice. However, cytokine and chemokine responses were generally elevated in WT mice, likely reflective of increased viral replication in the lung. In summary, these data show that a cellular factor, importin-α7, is required for enhanced virus replication in the alveolar epithelium, resulting in elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, extensive mononuclear infiltration, and thus, severe pneumonia and enhanced virulence in mice. Importance: Influenza A viruses are respiratory pathogens that may cause pneumonia in humans. Viral infection and replication in the alveoli of the respiratory tract are believed to be crucial for the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with fatal outcomes in influenza virus-infected patients. Here, we report the requirement of a cellular factor, importin-α7, for efficient virus replication in the alveolar epithelium of mice. Using complementary ex vivo imaging approaches, we show that influenza virus replication is restricted to the bronchial epithelium, followed by enhanced survival in importin-α7-deficient mice. In contrast, the presence of this gene results in enhanced virus replication in the alveoli, elevated cytokine and chemokine responses, mononuclear infiltration, alveolar destruction, and 100% lethality in wild-type mice. Taken together, our results show that importin-α7 is particularly required for virus replication in the alveolar epithelium in association with severe pneumonia and death in mice.

Title: Novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus induces impaired interferon responses in human dendritic cells.
Abstract: In March 2013 a new avian influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged in China and infected humans with a case fatality rate of over 30%. Like the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, H7N9 virus is causing severe respiratory distress syndrome in most patients. Based on genetic analysis this avian influenza A virus shows to some extent adaptation to mammalian host. In the present study, we analyzed the activation of innate immune responses by this novel H7N9 influenza A virus and compared these responses to those induced by the avian H5N1 and seasonal H3N2 viruses in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). We observed that in H7N9 virus-infected cells, interferon (IFN) responses were weak although the virus replicated as well as the H5N1 and H3N2 viruses in moDCs. H7N9 virus-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines remained at a significantly lower level as compared to H5N1 virus-induced "cytokine storm" seen in human moDCs. However, the H7N9 virus was extremely sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-α and IFN-β in pretreated cells. Our data indicates that different highly pathogenic avian viruses may show considerable differences in their ability to induce host antiviral responses in human primary cell models such as moDCs. The unexpected appearance of the novel H7N9 virus clearly emphasizes the importance of the global influenza surveillance system. It is, however, equally important to systematically characterize in normal human cells the replication capacity of the new viruses and their ability to induce and respond to natural antiviral substances such as IFNs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host innate immune responses to H7N9 virus infection without explicit analysis of viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza A viral nucleoprotein interacts with cytoskeleton scaffolding protein α-actinin-4 for viral replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV), similar to other viruses, exploits the machinery of human host cells for its survival and replication. We identified α-actinin-4, a host cytoskeletal protein, as an interacting partner of IAV nucleoprotein (NP). We confirmed this interaction using co-immunoprecipitation studies, first in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation assay and then in cells either transiently co-expressing the two proteins or infected with whole IAV. Importantly, the NP-actinin-4 interaction was observed in several IAV subtypes, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both NP and actinin-4 co-localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus-infected A549 cells. Silencing of actinin-4 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in NP, M2 and NS1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both NP mRNA and viral RNA levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post-infection with IAV, suggesting that actinin-4 was critical for viral replication. Furthermore, actinin-4 depletion reduced the amount of NP localized in the nucleus. Treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin-4, led to a decrease in NP mRNA levels and also caused the nuclear retention of NP, further strengthening our previous observations. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin-4, a novel interacting partner of IAV NP, plays a crucial role in viral replication and this interaction may participate in nuclear localization of NP and/or viral ribonucleoproteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on interaction between viral nucleoprotein and host cytoskeletal protein affecting viral replication, without direct viral genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: NLRX1 prevents mitochondrial induced apoptosis and enhances macrophage antiviral immunity by interacting with influenza virus PB1-F2 protein.
Abstract: To subvert host immunity, influenza A virus (IAV) induces early apoptosis in innate immune cells by disrupting mitochondria membrane potential via its polymerase basic protein 1-frame 2 (PB1-F2) accessory protein. Whether immune cells have mechanisms to counteract PB1-F2-mediated apoptosis is currently unknown. Herein, we define that the host mitochondrial protein nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR)X1 binds to viral protein PB1-F2, preventing IAV-induced macrophage apoptosis and promoting both macrophage survival and type I IFN signaling. We initially observed that Nlrx1-deficient mice infected with IAV exhibited increased pulmonary viral replication, as well as enhanced inflammatory-associated pulmonary dysfunction and morbidity. Analysis of the lungs of IAV-infected mice revealed markedly enhanced leukocyte recruitment but impaired production of type I IFN in Nlrx1(-/-) mice. Impaired type I IFN production and enhanced viral replication was recapitulated in Nlrx1(-/-) macrophages and was associated with increased mitochondrial mediated apoptosis. Through gain- and loss-of-function strategies for protein interaction, we identified that NLRX1 directly bound PB1-F2 in the mitochondria of macrophages. Using a recombinant virus lacking PB1-F2, we confirmed that deletion of PB1-F2 abrogated NLRX1-dependent macrophage type I IFN production and apoptosis. Thus, our results demonstrate that NLRX1 acts as a mitochondrial sentinel protecting macrophages from PB1-F2-induced apoptosis and preserving their antiviral function. We further propose that NLRX1 is critical for macrophage immunity against IAV infection by sensing the extent of viral replication and maintaining a protective balance between antiviral immunity and excessive inflammation within the lungs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host protein NLRX1 interaction with viral PB1-F2 protein affecting immune response, focusing on host-virus interaction rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Simvastatin modulates cellular components in influenza A virus-infected cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is one of the most important health risks that lead to significant respiratory infections. Continuous antigenic changes and lack of promising vaccines are the reasons for the unsuccessful treatment of influenza. Statins are pleiotropic drugs that have recently served as anti-influenza agents due to their anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, the effect of simvastatin on influenza A-infected cells was investigated. Based on the MTT cytotoxicity test, hemagglutination (HA) assay and qPCR it was found that simvastatin maintained cell viability and decreased the viral load significantly as compared to virus-inoculated cells. The expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interferon-γ), which was quantified using ELISA showed that simvastatin decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines to an average of 2-fold. Furthermore, the modulation of actin filament polymerization was determined using rhodamine staining. Endocytosis and autophagy processes were examined by detecting Rab and RhoA GTPase protein prenylation and LC3 lipidation using western blotting. The results showed that inhibiting GTPase and LC3 membrane localization using simvastatin inhibits influenza replication. Findings of this study provide evidence that modulation of RhoA, Rabs and LC3 may be the underlying mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of simvastatin as an anti-influenza compound.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the effect of simvastatin on host cell components and influenza replication, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Early cytokine dysregulation and viral replication are associated with mortality during lethal influenza infection.
Abstract: Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) leads to acute lung injury and possibly fatal complications, especially in immunocompromised, elderly, or chronically infected individuals. Therefore, it is important to study the factors that lead to pathology and mortality in infected hosts. In this report, we analyze immune responses to infection at a sublethal (0.1 LD(50)) and lethal (1 LD(50)) dose of the highly pathogenic IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). Our experiments revealed that infection with a 1 LD(50) dose induced peak viral titers at day 2 compared to day 4 in the 0.1 LD(50) dose. Moreover, early cytokine dysregulation was observed in the lethal dose with significantly elevated levels of IFN-α, TNF-α, CXCL9, IL-6, and MCP-1 produced at day 2. Early inflammatory responses following infection with 1 LD(50) correlated with a greater influx of neutrophils into the lung. However, depletion of neutrophils enhanced morbidity following IAV infection. Though no differences in CD8+ cell function were observed, CD4+ effector responses were impaired in the lungs 8 days after infection with 1 LD(50). Histological analysis revealed significant pathology in lethally infected mice at day 2 and day 6 postinfection, when viral titers remained high. Treating lethally infected mice with oseltamivir inhibited viral titers to sublethal levels, and abrogated the pathology associated with the lethal dose. Together, these results suggest that early cytokine dysregulation and viral replication play a role in pulmonary damage and high mortality in lethally infected mice.
Relevant: False

Title: Regulatory roles of c-jun in H5N1 influenza virus replication and host inflammation.
Abstract: The cytokine storm which is a great burden on humanity in highly pathogenic influenza virus infections requires activation of multiple signaling pathways. These pathways, such as MAPK and JNK, are important for viral replication and host inflammatory response. Here we examined the roles of JNK downstream molecule c-jun in host inflammatory responses and H5N1 virus replication using a c-jun targeted DNAzyme (Dz13). Transfection of Dz13 significantly reduced H5N1 influenza virus replication in human lung epithelial cells. Concomitantly, there was a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-β and interleukin (IL)-6) in c-jun suppressed cells, while the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, was increased. In vivo, compared with control groups, suppression of c-jun improved the survival rate of mice infected with H5N1 virus (55.5% in Dz13 treated mice versus ≤11% of control mice) and decreased the CD8(+) T cell proliferation. Simultaneously, the pulmonary inflammatory response and viral burden also decreased in the Dz13 treated group. Thus, our data demonstrated a critical role for c-jun in the establishment of H5N1 infection and subsequent inflammatory reactions, which suggest that c-jun may be a potential therapeutic target for viral pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of c-jun in viral replication and host inflammation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A zanamivir dimer with prophylactic and enhanced therapeutic activity against influenza viruses.
Abstract: Emerging drug resistance to antiviral therapies is an increasing challenge for the treatment of influenza virus infections. One new antiviral compound, BTA938, a dimeric derivative of the viral neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, contains a 14-carbon linker bridging two zanamivir moieties. In these studies, we evaluated antiviral efficacy in cell cultures infected with influenza virus and in mouse models of lethal influenza using H1N1pdm09, H3N2 and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) viruses. In vitro activity was evaluated against 22 strains of influenza virus. Additionally, in vivo studies compared the efficacy of BTA938 or zanamivir after intranasal treatment. We also tested the hypothesis of a dual mode of action for BTA938 using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). BTA938 inhibited the viruses at nanomolar concentrations in vitro with a median 50% effective concentration value of 0.5 nM. In mouse models, the dimer provided ∼10-fold greater protection than zanamivir. The data also showed that a single low dose (3 mg/kg) protected 100% of mice from an otherwise lethal oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) influenza virus infection. Remarkably, a single prophylactic treatment (10 mg/kg) administered 7 days before the challenge protected 70% of mice and when administered 1 or 3 days before the challenge it protected 90% of mice. Additionally, SEM provides evidence that the increased antiviral potency may be mediated by an enhanced aggregation of virus on the cell surface. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed the high antiviral activity of BTA938 for the treatment of influenza virus infections. Moreover, we demonstrated that a single dose of BTA938 is sufficient for prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mouse models.

Title: β-catenin promotes the type I IFN synthesis and the IFN-dependent signaling response but is suppressed by influenza A virus-induced RIG-I/NF-κB signaling.
Abstract: The replication cycle of most pathogens, including influenza viruses, is perfectly adapted to the metabolism and signal transduction pathways of host cells. After infection, influenza viruses activate several cellular signaling cascades that support their propagation but suppress those that interfere with viral replication. Accumulation of viral RNA plays thereby a central role. Its sensing by the pattern recognition receptors of the host cells leads to the activation of several signal transduction waves that result in induction of genes, responsible for the cellular innate immune response. Type I interferon (IFN) genes and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) coding for antiviral-acting proteins, such as MxA, OAS-1 or PKR, are primary targets of these signaling cascades. β- and γ-catenin are closely related armadillo repeat-containing proteins with dual roles. At the cell membrane they serve as adapter molecules linking cell-cell contacts to microfilaments. In the cytosol and nucleus, the proteins form a transcriptional complex with the lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF), regulating the transcription of many genes, thereby controlling different cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that β- and γ-catenin are important regulators of the innate cellular immune response to influenza A virus (IAV) infections. They inhibit viral replication in lung epithelial cells by enhancing the virus-dependent induction of the IFNB1 gene and interferon-stimulated genes. Simultaneously, the prolonged infection counteracts the antiviral effect of β- and γ-catenin. Influenza viruses suppress β-catenin-dependent transcription by misusing the RIG-I/NF-κB signaling cascade that is induced in the course of infection by viral RNA. We identified β- and γ-catenin as novel antiviral-acting proteins. While these factors support the induction of common target genes of the cellular innate immune response, their functional activity is suppressed by pathogen evasion.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host cellular factors (β-catenin) affecting viral replication and immune response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: High-level systemic expression of conserved influenza epitope in plants on the surface of rod-shaped chimeric particles.
Abstract: Recombinant viruses based on the cDNA copy of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) genome carrying different versions of the conserved M2e epitope from influenza virus A cloned into the coat protein (CP) gene were obtained and partially characterized by our group previously; cysteines in the human consensus M2e sequence were changed to serine residues. This work intends to show some biological properties of these viruses following plant infections. Agroinfiltration experiments on Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed the efficient systemic expression of M2e peptides, and two point amino acid substitutions in recombinant CPs significantly influenced the symptoms and development of viral infections. Joint expression of RNA interference suppressor protein p19 from tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) did not affect the accumulation of CP-M2e-ser recombinant protein in non-inoculated leaves. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from either infected leaves or purified TMV-M2e particles proved the genetic stability of TMV‑based viral vectors. Immunoelectron microscopy of crude plant extracts demonstrated that foreign epitopes are located on the surface of chimeric virions. The rod‑shaped geometry of plant-produced M2e epitopes is different from the icosahedral or helical filamentous arrangement of M2e antigens on the carrier virus-like particles (VLP) described earlier. Thereby, we created a simple and efficient system that employs agrobacteria and plant viral vectors in order to produce a candidate broad-spectrum flu vaccine.

Title: Efficient Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent.
Abstract: Population structure significantly affects evolutionary dynamics. Such structure may be due to spatial segregation, but may also reflect any other gene-flow-limiting aspect of a model. In combination with the structured coalescent, this fact can be used to inform phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as to infer parameters such as migration rates and subpopulation sizes from annotated sequence data. However, conducting Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent is impeded by the difficulty of constructing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms (samplers) capable of efficiently exploring the state space. In this article, we present a new MCMC sampler capable of sampling from posterior distributions over structured trees: timed phylogenetic trees in which lineages are associated with the distinct subpopulation in which they lie. The sampler includes a set of MCMC proposal functions that offer significant mixing improvements over a previously published method. Furthermore, its implementation as a BEAST 2 package ensures maximum flexibility with respect to model and prior specification. We demonstrate the usefulness of this new sampler by using it to infer migration rates and effective population sizes of H3N2 influenza between New Zealand, New York and Hong Kong from publicly available hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences under the structured coalescent. The sampler has been implemented as a publicly available BEAST 2 package that is distributed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License at http://compevol.github.io/MultiTypeTree.

Title: Deletion of the complement C5a receptor alleviates the severity of acute pneumococcal otitis media following influenza A virus infection in mice.
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that influenza A virus (IAV) promotes adherence, colonization, and superinfection by S. pneumoniae (Spn) and contributes to the pathogenesis of otitis media (OM). The complement system is a critical innate immune defense against both pathogens. To assess the role of the complement system in the host defense and the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection, we employed a well-established transtympanically-induced mouse model of acute pneumococcal OM. We found that antecedent IAV infection enhanced the severity of acute pneumococcal OM. Mice deficient in complement C1qa (C1qa-/-) or factor B (Bf -/-) exhibited delayed viral and bacterial clearance from the middle ear and developed significant mucosal damage in the eustachian tube and middle ear. This indicates that both the classical and alternative complement pathways are critical for the oto-immune defense against acute pneumococcal OM following influenza infection. We also found that Spn increased complement activation following IAV infection. This was characterized by sustained increased levels of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a in serum and middle ear lavage samples. In contrast, mice deficient in the complement C5a receptor (C5aR) demonstrated enhanced bacterial clearance and reduced severity of OM. Our data support the concept that C5a-C5aR interactions play a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection. It is possible that targeting the C5a-C5aR axis might prove useful in attenuating acute pneumococcal OM in patients with influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host complement system roles in pathogenesis following influenza infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prevention of influenza by targeting host receptors using engineered proteins.
Abstract: There is a need for new approaches for the control of influenza given the burden caused by annual seasonal outbreaks, the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential, and the development of resistance to current antiviral drugs. We show that multivalent biologics, engineered using carbohydrate-binding modules specific for sialic acid, mask the cell-surface receptor recognized by the influenza virus and protect mice from a lethal challenge with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The most promising biologic protects mice when given as a single 1-μg intranasal dose 7 d in advance of viral challenge. There also is sufficient virus replication to establish an immune response, potentially protecting the animal from future exposure to the virus. Furthermore, the biologics appear to stimulate inflammatory mediators, and this stimulation may contribute to their protective ability. Our results suggest that this host-targeted approach could provide a front-line prophylactic that has the potential to protect against any current and future influenza virus and possibly against other respiratory pathogens that use sialic acid as a receptor.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on engineered proteins targeting host receptors to prevent influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Innate immune response to a H3N2 subtype swine influenza virus in newborn porcine trachea cells, alveolar macrophages, and precision-cut lung slices.
Abstract: Viral respiratory diseases remain of major importance in swine breeding units. Swine influenza virus (SIV) is one of the main known contributors to infectious respiratory diseases. The innate immune response to swine influenza viruses has been assessed in many previous studies. However most of these studies were carried out in a single-cell population or directly in the live animal, in all its complexity. In the current study we report the use of a trachea epithelial cell line (newborn pig trachea cells - NPTr) in comparison with alveolar macrophages and lung slices for the characterization of innate immune response to an infection by a European SIV of the H3N2 subtype. The expression pattern of transcripts involved in the recognition of the virus, interferon type I and III responses, and the host-response regulation were assessed by quantitative PCR in response to infection. Some significant differences were observed between the three systems, notably in the expression of type III interferon mRNA. Then, results show a clear induction of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways in infected NPTr cells. Conversely, PI3K/Akt signaling pathways was not activated. The inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway clearly reduced interferon type I and III responses and the induction of SOCS1 at the transcript level in infected NPTr cells. Similarly, the inhibition of MAPK pathway reduced viral replication and interferon response. All together, these results contribute to an increased understanding of the innate immune response to H3N2 SIV and may help identify strategies to effectively control SIV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on innate immune response to a specific H3N2 swine influenza virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mass spectrometry-based comparative sequence analysis for the genetic monitoring of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.
Abstract: The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus (pH1N1) contains novel gene segments of zoonotic origin that lack virulence and antiviral resistance markers. We aimed to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of mass spectrometry-based comparative sequence analysis (MSCSA) to detect genetic mutations associated with increased virulence or antiviral resistance in pH1N1. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, routine surveillance specimens and clinical antiviral resistance monitoring specimens were analyzed. Routine surveillance specimens obtained from 70 patients with pH1N1 infection were evaluated for mutations associated with increased virulence (PB1-F2, PB2 and NS1 genes) or antiviral resistance (neuraminidase gene, NA) using MSCSA and Sanger sequencing. MSCSA and Sanger sequencing results revealed a high concordance (nucleotides >99%, SNPs ∼ 94%). Virulence or resistance markers were not detected in routine surveillance specimens: all identified SNPs encoded for silent mutations or non-relevant amino acid substitutions. In a second study population, the presence of H275Y oseltamivir resistant virus was identified by real-time PCR in 19 of 35 clinical antiviral resistance monitoring specimens obtained from 4 immunocompromised patients with ≥ 14 days prolonged pH1N1 excretion. MSCSA detected H275Y in 24% (4/19) of positive specimens and Sanger sequencing in 89% (17/19). MSCSA only detected H275Y when the mutation was dominant in the analyzed specimens. In conclusion, MSCSA may be used as a rapid screening tool during molecular surveillance of pH1N1. The low sensitivity for the detection of H275Y mutation in mixed viral populations suggests that MSCSA is not suitable for antiviral resistance monitoring in the clinical setting.
Relevant: False

Title: Quantitative measurement of influenza virus replication using consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage in the lower respiratory tract of a ferret model.
Abstract: The ferret is an established animal model of influenza virus infection. Although viral replication in the upper respiratory tract is usually measured with consecutively collected nasal washes, daily evaluation of viral replication in the lung is limited because a large numbers of ferrets need to be sacrificed at consecutive time points. To overcome this limitation, we performed a virus quantification assay using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. This non-invasive BAL technique allows consecutive quantification of virus replication in the lungs of living ferrets. Our method can be used for the longitudinal evaluation of virus tropism in the lower respiratory tract.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes a method for measuring viral replication in ferrets but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Protective efficacy of a high-growth reassortant swine H3N2 inactivated vaccine constructed by reverse genetic manipulation.
Abstract: Novel reassortant H3N2 swine influenza viruses (SwIV) with the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus have been isolated in many countries as well as during outbreaks in multiple states in the United States, indicating that H3N2 SwIV might be a potential threat to public health. Since southern China is the world's largest producer of pigs, efficient vaccines should be developed to prevent pigs from acquiring H3N2 subtype SwIV infections, and thus limit the possibility of SwIV infection at agricultural fairs. In this study, a high-growth reassortant virus (GD/PR8) was generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics and tested as a candidate inactivated vaccine. The protective efficacy of this vaccine was evaluated in mice by challenging them with another H3N2 SwIV isolate [A/Swine/Heilongjiang/1/05 (H3N2) (HLJ/05)]. Prime and booster inoculation with GD/PR8 vaccine yielded high-titer serum hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies and IgG antibodies. Complete protection of mice against H3N2 SwIV was observed, with significantly reduced lung lesion and viral loads in vaccine-inoculated mice relative to mock-vaccinated controls. These results suggest that the GD/PR8 vaccine may serve as a promising candidate for rapid intervention of H3N2 SwIV outbreaks in China.

Title: Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-2 genetic variant rs708035 increases NF-κB activity through promoting TRAF6 ubiquitination.
Abstract: The IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are key regulators of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 signaling, which are critical regulators of mammalian inflammation and innate immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IRAK genes have been discovered recently. However, the functions of these IRAK SNPs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the non-synonymous IRAK2 variant rs708035 (coding D431E) increases NF-κB activity and leads to more expression of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines compared with IRAK2 wild type. Moreover, when IRAK2 knockdown cells reconstituted with siRNA-resistant WT-IRAK2 or D431E-IRAK2 were infected with influenza virus, a more obvious induction of IL-6 and a stronger anti-apoptosis effect were observed in D431E-IRAK2 expressing cells. Notably, we also found that the levels of proinflammatory cytokine-IL-6 were indeed higher in people carrying D431E-IRAK2 than those carrying WT-IRAK2. Further study demonstrated that elevated NF-κB activation mediated by the IRAK2 variant was due to increased TRAF6 ubiquitination and faster IκBα degradation. Our study provides important insight of IRAK2 SNP in the regulation of NF-κB activation and indicates that IRAK2 rs708035 might be associated with human diseases caused by hyper-activation of NF-κB.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates a host genetic variant affecting NF-κB activity and immune response but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Axl receptor blockade ameliorates pulmonary pathology resulting from primary viral infection and viral exacerbation of asthma.
Abstract: Viruses use Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases to infect and modulate the immune properties of various cell types, which led us to investigate whether TAM receptor activation affected primary viral infection and viral exacerbation of asthma in experimental models. In these lung-specific models, we observed that Axl was the most abundantly induced TAM receptor protein. During primary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, anti-Axl mAb treatment significantly increased the number of IFN-γ-producing T cells and NK cells and significantly suppressed RSV replication and whole lung levels of IL-4 and IL-13. Intrapulmonary H1N1 infection induced lethal pulmonary inflammation, but anti-Axl mAb treatment of infected mice significantly increased the number of IFN-β-producing macrophages and dendritic cells and significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration. Consequently, the lethal effect of H1N1 infection in this model was significantly reduced in the mAb-treated group compared with the IgG control-treated group. Targeting Axl also inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness, IL-4 and IL-13 production, and goblet cell metaplasia in an Aspergillus fumigatus-induced asthma model. Finally, infection of mice with RSV during fungal asthma significantly exacerbated airway inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and airway remodeling, but all of these features in this viral exacerbation model were ameliorated by anti-Axl mAb treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Axl modulates the pulmonary immune response during viral and/or allergic pathology, and they also suggest that targeting this TAM receptor might provide a novel therapeutic approach in these infectious diseases.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host receptor (Axl) blockade effects on viral infection and immune response, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Prevalence and molecular characterization of human metapneumovirus in influenza a negative sample in Thailand.
Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes respiratory tract infection in influenza-like illness. The role of hMPV infections in all age groups in Thailand has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine prevalence of hMPV infection in all age groups in Thailand during 2011. A total of 1,184 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized patients and sent to the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, for influenza A virus detection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hMPV infection. Partially, F gene from hMPV positive samples were sequenced and used for genotyping by phylogenetic tree analysis. The prevalence of hMPV for all age groups was 6.3%. The highest prevalence of hMPV infection was in children aged <2 years. Of 71 hMPV-positive patients, three (4.2%) were coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two with rhinovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), and one with RSV and adenovirus (1.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene revealed that 96.8% of hMPV detected was subgenotype B1, 1.6% was sublineage A2a, and 1.6% was A2b. Genetic variation of F gene was much conserved. We demonstrated the prevalence of hMPV subgenotype B1 circulating in Thailand during 2011.

Title: North Atlantic migratory bird flyways provide routes for intercontinental movement of avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds has been of increasing interest over the last decade due to the emergence of AIVs that cause significant disease and mortality in both poultry and humans. While research clearly demonstrates that AIVs can move across the Pacific or Atlantic Ocean, there has been no data to support the mechanism of how this occurs. In spring and autumn of 2010 and autumn of 2011 we obtained cloacal swab samples from 1078 waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds of various species in southwest and west Iceland and tested them for AIV. From these, we isolated and fully sequenced the genomes of 29 AIVs from wild caught gulls (Charadriiformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes) in Iceland. We detected viruses that were entirely (8 of 8 genomic segments) of American lineage, viruses that were entirely of Eurasian lineage, and viruses with mixed American-Eurasian lineage. Prior to this work only 2 AIVs had been reported from wild birds in Iceland and only the sequence from one segment was available in GenBank. This is the first report of finding AIVs of entirely American lineage and Eurasian lineage, as well as reassortant viruses, together in the same geographic location. Our study demonstrates the importance of the North Atlantic as a corridor for the movement of AIVs between Europe and North America.

Title: Inferring heterogeneous evolutionary processes through time: from sequence substitution to phylogeography.
Abstract: Molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic reconstructions generally assume time-homogeneous substitution processes. Motivated by computational convenience, this assumption sacrifices biological realism and offers little opportunity to uncover the temporal dynamics in evolutionary histories. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that explicitly relaxes the time-homogeneity assumption by allowing the specification of different infinitesimal substitution rate matrices across different time intervals, called epochs, along the evolutionary history. We focus on an epoch model implementation in a Bayesian inference framework that offers great modeling flexibility in drawing inference about any discrete data type characterized as a continuous-time Markov chain, including phylogeographic traits. To alleviate the computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we adopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain parallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch transitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units. Through synthetic examples, we assess model performance in recovering evolutionary parameters from data generated according to different evolutionary scenarios that comprise different numbers of epochs for both nucleotide and codon substitution processes. We illustrate the usefulness of our inference framework in two different applications to empirical data sets: the selection dynamics on within-host HIV populations throughout infection and the seasonality of global influenza circulation. In both cases, our epoch model captures key features of temporal heterogeneity that remained difficult to test using ad hoc procedures.

Title: Proteolytic enzymes in embryonated chicken eggs sustain the replication of egg-grown low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in cells in the absence of exogenous proteases.
Abstract: Low pathogenic influenza viruses grow readily in embryonated chicken eggs but require the addition of exogenous proteases to grow in MDCK cell culture. In this study, we found that the influenza viruses propagated previously in eggs, can grow for up to two passages in cell culture without the addition of exogenous proteolytic enzymes. These results indicate that the reason for virus propagation in cells during the first two passages may be due to proteases from egg allantoic fluid carried over from egg culture. The ability of influenza viruses to grow in cells in the absence of trypsin is currently considered as a hallmark of highly pathogenic influenza viruses. Our data indicate that differentiating between high and low pathogenicity using cell culture only is not appropriate and other indicators such as sequence analysis and in vitro pathogenicity index should be performed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines viral growth in cell culture related to proteolytic enzymes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cocirculation of three hemagglutinin and two neuraminidase subtypes of avian influenza viruses in Huzhou, China, April 2013: implication for the origin of the novel H7N9 virus.
Abstract: We detected three avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H7, H9, and H5) and two neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (N9 and N2), as well as H7N9-related H9N9 reassortant intermediates, cocirculating among poultry in Huzhou, China, during April 2013. The results of our study reveal not only that Huzhou is one of the geographic origins of the novel H7N9 virus but also that cocirculation poses a potential threat to humans in the future.

Title: Influenza a virus assembly intermediates fuse in the cytoplasm.
Abstract: Reassortment of influenza viral RNA (vRNA) segments in co-infected cells can lead to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential. Replication of influenza vRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, while progeny virions bud from the plasma membrane. However, the intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions is not well understood. Here we used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en route to the plasma membrane. Our data strongly support a model in which vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as complexes that assemble en route to the plasma membrane through dynamic colocalization events in the cytoplasm.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates intracellular viral RNA assembly dynamics but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Construction of recombinant Marek's disease virus (rMDV) co-expressing AIV-H9N2-NA and NDV-F genes under control of MDV's own bi-directional promoter.
Abstract: To qualitatively analyze and evaluate a bi-directional promoter transcriptional function in both transient and transgenic systems, several different plasmids were constructed and recombinant MDV type 1 strain GX0101 was developed to co-express a Neuraminidase (NA) gene from Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 strain and a Fusion (F) gene from the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The two foreign genes, NDV-F gene and AIV-NA gene, were inserted in the plasmid driven in each direction by the bi-directional promoter. To test whether the expression of pp38/pp24 heterodimers are the required activators for the expression of the foreign genes, the recombinant plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F containing expression cassette for the two foreign genes was co-transfected with a pp38/pp24 expression plasmid, pBud-pp38-pp24, in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Alternatively, plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F was transfected in GX0101-infected CEFs where the viral endogenous pp38/pp24 were expressed via virus infection. The expression of both foreign genes was activated by pp38/pp24 dimers either via virus infection, or co-expression. The CEFs transfected with pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F alone had no expression. We chose to insert the expression cassette of Ppp38-NA/1.8kb-F in the non-essential region of GX0101ΔMeq US2 gene, and formed a new rMDV named MZC13NA/F through homologous recombination. Indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) test, ELISA and Western blot analyses indicated that F and NA genes were expressed simultaneously under control of the bi-directional promoter, but in opposite directions. The data also indicated the activity of the promoter in the 1.8-kb mRNA transcript direction was higher than that in the direction for the pp38 gene. The expression of pp38/pp24 dimers either via co-tranfection of the pBud-pp38-pp24 plasmid, or by GX0101 virus infection were critical to activate the bi-directional promoter for expression of two foreign genes in both directions. Therefore, the confirmed function of the bi-directional promoter provides better feasibilities to insert multiple foreign genes in MDV genome based vectors.

Title: Pretreatment of epithelial cells with live Streptococcus pneumoniae has no detectable effect on influenza A virus replication in vitro.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are two major upper respiratory tract pathogens responsible for exacerbated disease in coinfected individuals. Despite several studies showing increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections following IAV infection, information on the direct effect of S. pneumoniae on IAV in vitro is unknown. This is an important area of investigation as S. pneumoniae is a common commensal of the human upper respiratory tract, present as an important coinfecting pathogen with IAV infection. A recent study showed that S. pneumoniae enhances human metapneumovirus infection in polarized bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. The aim of the current study was to determine whether treatment of epithelial cells with S. pneumoniae affects IAV replication using a standard immunofluorescence assay (IFA). For this study we used four IAV permissive epithelial cell lines including two human-derived cell lines, 12 pneumococcal strains including recent human clinical isolates which represent different genetic backgrounds and serotypes, and six IAV strains of varying genetic nature and pathogenic potential including the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. Our results suggested that pretreatment of MDCK cells with 7.5×10(6) colony-forming units (CFUs) of live S. pneumoniae resulted in gradual cell-death in a time-dependent manner (0.5 to 4 hr). But, pretreatment of cell lines with 7.5×10(5) and lower CFUs of S. pneumoniae had no detectable effect on either the morphology of cells or on the IAV replication. However, unlike in epithelial cell lines, due to influence of secreted host factors the effect of pneumococci on IAV replication may be different during coinfections in vivo in the human upper respiratory tract, and in vitro with primary human polarized bronchial epithelial cells.

Reason: The study examines the effect of bacterial pretreatment on influenza virus replication in vitro without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Suppression of immunodominant antitumor and antiviral CD8+ T cell responses by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
Abstract: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan-degrading enzyme known to suppress antitumor CD8(+) T cells (TCD8). The role of IDO in regulation of antiviral TCD8 responses is far less clear. In addition, whether IDO controls both immunodominant and subdominant TCD8 is not fully understood. This is an important question because the dominance status of tumor- and virus-specific TCD8 may determine their significance in protective immunity and in vaccine design. We evaluated the magnitude and breadth of cross-primed TCD8 responses to simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen as well as primary and recall TCD8 responses to influenza A virus (IAV) in the absence or presence of IDO. IDO(-/-) mice and wild-type mice treated with 1-methyl-D-tryptophan, a pharmacological inhibitor of IDO, exhibited augmented responses to immunodominant epitopes encoded by T antigen and IAV. IDO-mediated suppression of these responses was independent of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, which remained numerically and functionally intact in IDO(-/-) mice. Treatment with L-kynurenine failed to inhibit TCD8 responses, indicating that tryptophan metabolites are not responsible for the suppressive effect of IDO in our models. Immunodominant T antigen-specific TCD8 from IDO(-/-) mice showed increased Ki-67 expression, suggesting that they may have acquired a more vigorous proliferative capacity in vivo. In conclusion, IDO suppresses immunodominant TCD8 responses to tumor and viral antigens. Our work also demonstrates that systemic primary and recall TCD8 responses to IAV are controlled by IDO. Inhibition of IDO thus represents an attractive adjuvant strategy in boosting anticancer and antiviral TCD8 targeting highly immunogenic antigens.

Title: An investigational antiviral drug, DAS181, effectively inhibits replication of zoonotic influenza A virus subtype H7N9 and protects mice from lethality.
Abstract: Human infections caused by avian influenza A virus type subtype H7N9 have been associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Emergence of virus variants carrying markers of decreased susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was reported. Here we show that DAS181 (Fludase), an antiviral drug with sialidase activity, potently inhibited replication of wild-type influenza A(H7N9) and its oseltamivir-resistant R292K variants in mice. A once-daily administration initiated early after lethal infection hampered body weight loss and completely protected mice from lethality. We observed a time-dependent effect for 24-72-hour delayed DAS181 treatments on morbidity and mortality. The results warrant further investigation of DAS181 for influenza treatment.

Title: Acylation and cholesterol binding are not required for targeting of influenza A virus M2 protein to the hemagglutinin-defined budozone.
Abstract: Influenza virus assembles in the budozone, a cholesterol-/sphingolipid-enriched ("raft") domain at the apical plasma membrane, organized by hemagglutinin (HA). The viral protein M2 localizes to the budozone edge for virus particle scission. This was proposed to depend on acylation and cholesterol binding. We show that M2-GFP without these motifs is still transported apically in polarized cells. Employing FRET, we determined that clustering between HA and M2 is reduced upon disruption of HA's raft-association features (acylation, transmembranous VIL motif), but remains unchanged with M2 lacking acylation and/or cholesterol-binding sites. The motifs are thus irrelevant for M2 targeting in cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of acylation and cholesterol binding in M2 protein targeting but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The development and survival but not function of follicular B cells is dependent on IL-7Rα Tyr449 signaling.
Abstract: IL-7 is a critical cytokine for lymphocyte development. Recent work has highlighted critical roles for IL-7 signaling in mature T cell homeostasis and function, but its role in B cells is less well characterized. Using a knock-in mouse possessing a Tyr to Phe mutation at position 449 (IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mice) within the cytoplasmic SH2-binding motif of IL-7Rα, we evaluated the role of IL-7Rα Y449 motif in spleen B cells. IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mice had reduced numbers and increased death of follicular B cells compared to WT, but had significantly more follicular cells than IL-7Rα(-/-). The death of IL-7Rα(449F/449F) follicular cells was not due to a failure to respond to BAFF or lower levels of BAFF, a critical B cell survival factor. Marginal zone B cells were unaffected by the IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mutation. Any role for TSLP was ruled out, as TSLPR(-/-) mice had an identical B cell phenotype to wild-type mice. Bone marrow chimeras and the absence of IL-7Rα on B cells suggested that IL-7 did not directly regulate mature B cells, but that an IL-7-responsive cell was influencing B cells. IL-7 was also critical at the checkpoint between the T1 and T2 stages in the spleen. IL-7Rα(-/-) mice fail to develop T2 cells, but IL-7Rα(449F/449F) show a reduction compared to WT but not complete absence of T2 cells. We also tested the functional responses of IL-7Rα(449F/449F) to antigens and infection and found no difference in antibody responses to T-dependent or T-independent antigens, or to Influenza/A. IL-7 was important for generation of antibody responses to the intestinal worm H. polygyrus and for naive levels of IgA. Taken together, this suggests that IL-7 regulates follicular B cell numbers and survival in a cell-extrinsic manner, via a bone-marrow derived cell, but is not critical for antibody production outside the gut.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies IL-7Rα signaling in B cells and immune function, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Identification of an LGP2-associated MDA5 agonist in picornavirus-infected cells.
Abstract: The RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I, LGP2, and MDA5 initiate an antiviral response that includes production of type I interferons (IFNs). The nature of the RNAs that trigger MDA5 activation in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we purify and characterise LGP2/RNA complexes from cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 and LGP2 but not RIG-I. We show that those complexes contain RNA that is highly enriched for MDA5-stimulatory activity and for a specific sequence corresponding to the L region of the EMCV antisense RNA. Synthesis of this sequence by in vitro transcription is sufficient to generate an MDA5 stimulatory RNA. Conversely, genomic deletion of the L region in EMCV generates viruses that are less potent at stimulating MDA5-dependent IFN production. Thus, the L region antisense RNA of EMCV is a key determinant of innate immunity to the virus and represents an RNA that activates MDA5 in virally-infected cells. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01535.001.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies an RNA sequence activating MDA5 in picornavirus infection, unrelated to influenza viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of a swine influenza A(H3N2) virus isolated in Korea in 2012.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) can infect avian and mammalian species, including humans. The genome nature of IAVs may contribute to viral adaptation in different animal hosts, resulting in gene reassortment and the reproduction of variants with optimal fitness. As seen again in the 2009 swine-origin influenza A H1N1 pandemic, pigs are known to be susceptible to swine, avian, and human IAVs and can serve as a 'mixing vessel' for the generation of novel IAV variants. To this end, the emergence of swine influenza viruses must be kept under close surveillance. Herein, we report the isolation and phylogenetic study of a swine IAV, A/swine/Korea/PL01/2012 (swPL01, H3N2 subtype). After screening nasopharyngeal samples from pigs in the Gyeongsangnam-do region of Korea from December 2011 to May 2012, we isolated the swPL01 virus and sequenced its all of 8 genome segments (polymerase basic 2, PB2; polymerase basic 1, PB1; polymerase acidic, PA; hemagglutinin, HA; nucleocapsid protein, NP; neuraminidase, NA; matrix protein, M; and nonstructural protein, NS). The phylogenetic study, analyzed with reference strains registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, indicated that the swPL01 virus was similar to the North American triple-reassortant swine strains and that the HA gene of the swPL01 virus was categorized into swine H3 cluster IV. The swPL01 virus had the M gene of the triple-reassortant swine H3N2 viruses, whereas that of other contemporary strains in Korea was transferred from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. These data suggest the possibility that various swine H3N2 viruses may co-circulate in Korea, which underlines the importance of a sustained surveillance system against swine IAVs.

Title: Prospective surveillance and molecular characterization of seasonal influenza in a university cohort in Singapore.
Abstract: Southeast Asia is believed to be a potential locus for the emergence of novel influenza strains, and therefore accurate sentinel surveillance in the region is critical. Limited information exists on sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in young adults in Singapore in a University campus setting. The objective of the present study was to determine the proportion of ILI caused by influenza A and B viruses in a university cohort in Singapore. We conducted a prospective surveillance study from May through October 2007, at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Basic demographic information and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from students and staff with ILI. Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation were employed to detect influenza viruses. Sequencing of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of some representative isolates was also performed. Overall proportions of influenza A and B virus infections were 47/266 (18%) and 9/266 (3%) respectively. The predominant subtype was A/H3N2 (55%) and the rest were A/H1N1 (45%). The overall sensitivity difference for detection of influenza A viruses using RT-PCR and viral isolation was 53%. Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA gene sequences of Singapore strains showed identities higher than 98% within both the genes. The strains were more similar to strains included in the WHO vaccine recommendation for the following year (2008). Genetic markers of oseltamivir resistance were not detected in any of the sequenced Singapore isolates. HA and NA gene sequences of Singapore strains were similar to vaccine strains for the upcoming influenza season. No drug resistance was found. Sentinel surveillance on university campuses should make use of molecular methods to better detect emerging and re-emerging influenza viral threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and molecular characterization of influenza strains without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Preliminary success in the characterization and management of a sudden breakout of a novel H7N9 influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza has always been one of the major threats to human health. The Spanish influenza in 1918, the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 2009, and the avian influenza A/H5N1 have brought about great disasters or losses to mankind. More recently, a novel avian influenza A/H7N9 broke out in China and until December 2, 2013, it had caused 139 cases of infection, including 45 deaths. Its risk and pandemic potential attract worldwide attention. In this article, we summarize epidemiology, virology characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis methods, clinical treatment and preventive measures about the avian influenza A/H7N9 virus infection to provide a reference for a possible next wave of flu outbreak.

Title: Genetic structure of avian influenza viruses from ducks of the Atlantic flyway of North America.
Abstract: Wild birds, including waterfowl such as ducks, are reservoir hosts of influenza A viruses. Despite the increased number of avian influenza virus (AIV) genome sequences available, our understanding of AIV genetic structure and transmission through space and time in waterfowl in North America is still limited. In particular, AIVs in ducks of the Atlantic flyway of North America have not been thoroughly investigated. To begin to address this gap, we analyzed 109 AIV genome sequences from ducks in the Atlantic flyway to determine their genetic structure and to document the extent of gene flow in the context of sequences from other locations and other avian and mammalian host groups. The analyses included 25 AIVs from ducks from Newfoundland, Canada, from 2008-2011 and 84 available reference duck AIVs from the Atlantic flyway from 2006-2011. A vast diversity of viral genes and genomes was identified in the 109 viruses. The genetic structure differed amongst the 8 viral segments with predominant single lineages found for the PB2, PB1 and M segments, increased diversity found for the PA, NP and NS segments (2, 3 and 3 lineages, respectively), and the highest diversity found for the HA and NA segments (12 and 9 lineages, respectively). Identification of inter-hemispheric transmissions was rare with only 2% of the genes of Eurasian origin. Virus transmission between ducks and other bird groups was investigated, with 57.3% of the genes having highly similar (≥99% nucleotide identity) genes detected in birds other than ducks. Transmission between North American flyways has been frequent and 75.8% of the genes were highly similar to genes found in other North American flyways. However, the duck AIV genes did display spatial distribution bias, which was demonstrated by the different population sizes of specific viral genes in one or two neighbouring flyways compared to more distant flyways.

Reason: The paper focuses on genetic structure and transmission patterns of avian influenza viruses without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Novel phage display-derived H5N1-specific scFvs with potential use in rapid avian flu diagnosis.
Abstract: The highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype infect poultry and have also been spreading to humans. Although new antiviral drugs and vaccinations can be effective, rapid detection would be more efficient to control the outbreak of infections. In this study, a phage-display library was applied to select antibody fragments for HPAI strain A/Hubei/1/2010. As a result, three clones were selected and sequenced. A hemagglutinin inhibition assay of the three scFvs revealed that none exhibited hemagglutination inhibition activity towards the H5N1 virus, yet they showed a higher binding affinity for several HPAI H5N1 strains compared with other influenza viruses. An ELISA confirmed that the HA protein was the target of the scFvs, and the results of a protein structure simulation showed that all the selected scFvs bound to the HA2 subunit of the HA protein. In conclusion, the three selected scFVs could be useful for developing a specific detection tool for the surveillance of HPAI epidemic strains.

Title: Revised and updated nomenclature for highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses.
Abstract: The divergence of the hemagglutinin gene of A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-lineage H5N1 viruses during 2011 and 2012 (807 new sequences collected through December 31, 2012) was analyzed by phylogenetic and p-distance methods to define new clades using the pre-established nomenclature system. Eight new clade designations were recommended based on division of clade 1·1 (Mekong River Delta), 2·1·3·2 (Indonesia), 2·2·2 (India/Bangladesh), 2·2·1·1 (Egypt/Israel), and 2·3·2·1 (Asia). A simplification to the previously defined criteria, which adds a letter rather than number to the right-most digit of fifth-order clades, was proposed to facilitate this and future updates.

Title: LABEL: fast and accurate lineage assignment with assessment of H5N1 and H9N2 influenza A hemagglutinins.
Abstract: The evolutionary classification of influenza genes into lineages is a first step in understanding their molecular epidemiology and can inform the subsequent implementation of control measures. We introduce a novel approach called Lineage Assignment By Extended Learning (LABEL) to rapidly determine cladistic information for any number of genes without the need for time-consuming sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, or manual annotation. Instead, LABEL relies on hidden Markov model profiles and support vector machine training to hierarchically classify gene sequences by their similarity to pre-defined lineages. We assessed LABEL by analyzing the annotated hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic (H5N1) and low pathogenicity (H9N2) avian influenza A viruses. Using the WHO/FAO/OIE H5N1 evolution working group nomenclature, the LABEL pipeline quickly and accurately identified the H5 lineages of uncharacterized sequences. Moreover, we developed an updated clade nomenclature for the H9 hemagglutinin gene and show a similarly fast and reliable phylogenetic assessment with LABEL. While this study was focused on hemagglutinin sequences, LABEL could be applied to the analysis of any gene and shows great potential to guide molecular epidemiology activities, accelerate database annotation, and provide a data sorting tool for other large-scale bioinformatic studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on a computational method (LABEL) for rapid lineage assignment of influenza hemagglutinin genes without direct analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Environmental correlates of H5N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza outbreak heterogeneity in domestic poultry in Italy.
Abstract: Italy has experienced recurrent incursions of H5N2 avian influenza (AI) viruses in different geographical areas and varying sectors of the domestic poultry industry. Considering outbreak heterogeneity rather than treating all outbreaks of low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses equally is important given their interactions with the environment and potential to spread, evolve and increase pathogenicity. This study aims at identifying potential environmental drivers of H5N2 LPAI outbreak occurrence in time, space and poultry populations. Thirty-four environmental variables were tested for association with the characteristics of 27 H5N2 LPAI outbreaks (i.e. time, place, flock type, number and species of birds affected) occurred among domestic poultry flocks in Italy in 2010-2012. This was done by applying a recently proposed analytical approach based on a combined non-metric multidimensional scaling, clustering and regression analysis. Results indicated that the pattern of (dis)similarities among the outbreaks entailed an underlying structure that may be the outcome of large-scale, environmental interactions in ecological dimension. Increased densities of poultry breeders, and increased land coverage by industrial, commercial and transport units were associated with increased heterogeneity in outbreak characteristics. In areas with high breeder densities and with many infrastructures, outbreaks affected mainly industrial turkey/layer flocks. Outbreaks affecting ornamental, commercial and rural multi-species flocks occurred mainly in lowly infrastructured areas of northern Italy. Outbreaks affecting rural layer flocks occurred mainly in areas with low breeder densities in south-central Italy. In savannah-like environments, outbreaks affected mainly commercial flocks of galliformes. Suggestive evidence that ecological ordination makes sense genetically was also provided, as virus strains showing high genetic similarity clustered into ecologically similar outbreaks. Findings were informed by hypotheses about how ecological interactions among poultry populations, viruses and their environments can be related to the observed patterns of H5N2 LPAI occurrence. This may prove useful in enhancing future interventions by developing site-specific, ecologically-grounded strategies.

Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of a surface mutant of the middle domain of PB2 from human influenza A (H1N1) virus.
Abstract: In the last hundred years, four influenza pandemics have been experienced, beginning with that in Spain in 1918. Influenza A virus causes severe pneumonia and its RNA polymerase is an important target for drug design. The influenza A (H1N1) virus has eight ribonucleoprotein complexes, which are composed of viral RNA, RNA polymerases and nucleoproteins. PB2 forms part of the RNA polymerase complex and plays an important role in binding to the cap structure of host mRNA. The middle domain of PB2 includes a cap-binding site. The structure of PB2 from H1N1 complexed with m(7)GTP has not been reported. Plate-like crystals of the middle domain of PB2 from H1N1 were obtained, but the quality of these crystals was not good. An attempt was made to crystallize the middle domain of PB2 complexed with m(7)GTP using a soaking method; however, electron density for m(7)GTP was not observed on preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis. This protein has hydrophobic residues on its surface and is stable in the presence of high salt concentrations. To improve the solubility, a surface double mutant (P453H and I471T) was prepared. These mutations change the surface electrostatic potential drastically. The protein was successfully prepared at a lower salt concentration and good cube-shaped crystals were obtained using this protein. Here, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of this mutant of the middle domain of PB2 are reported.

Title: Identification of conserved RNA secondary structures at influenza B and C splice sites reveals similarities and differences between influenza A, B, and C.
Abstract: Influenza B and C are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause yearly epidemics and infections. Knowledge of RNA secondary structure generated by influenza B and C will be helpful in further understanding the role of RNA structure in the progression of influenza infection. All available protein-coding sequences for influenza B and C were analyzed for regions with high potential for functional RNA secondary structure. On the basis of conserved RNA secondary structure with predicted high thermodynamic stability, putative structures were identified that contain splice sites in segment 8 of influenza B and segments 6 and 7 of influenza C. The sequence in segment 6 also contains three unused AUG start codon sites that are sequestered within a hairpin structure. When added to previous studies on influenza A, the results suggest that influenza splicing may share common structural strategies for regulation of splicing. In particular, influenza 3' splice sites are predicted to form secondary structures that can switch conformation to regulate splicing. Thus, these RNA structures present attractive targets for therapeutics aimed at targeting one or the other conformation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on identifying conserved RNA secondary structures at influenza splice sites, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: ClassyFlu: classification of influenza A viruses with Discriminatively trained profile-HMMs.
Abstract: Accurate and rapid characterization of influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences with respect to subtype and clade is at the basis of extended diagnostic services and implicit to molecular epidemiologic studies. ClassyFlu is a new tool and web service for the classification of IAV sequences of the HA and NA gene into subtypes and phylogenetic clades using discriminatively trained profile hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for each subtype or clade. ClassyFlu merely requires as input unaligned, full-length or partial HA or NA DNA sequences. It enables rapid and highly accurate assignment of HA sequences to subtypes H1-H17 but particularly focusses on the finer grained assignment of sequences of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 according to the cladistics proposed by the H5N1 Evolution Working Group. NA sequences are classified into subtypes N1-N10. ClassyFlu was compared to semiautomatic classification approaches using BLAST and phylogenetics and additionally for H5 sequences to the new "Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Clade Classification Tool" (IRD-CT) proposed by the Influenza Research Database. Our results show that both web tools (ClassyFlu and IRD-CT), although based on different methods, are nearly equivalent in performance and both are more accurate and faster than semiautomatic classification. A retraining of ClassyFlu to altered cladistics as well as an extension of ClassyFlu to other IAV genome segments or fragments thereof is undemanding. This is exemplified by unambiguous assignment to a distinct cluster within subtype H7 of sequences of H7N9 viruses which emerged in China early in 2013 and caused more than 130 human infections. http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/ClassyFlu is a free web service. For local execution, the ClassyFlu source code in PERL is freely available.

Title: Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 viruses: coexistence in poultry linked to human H7N9 infection and genome characteristics.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so. Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans.

Title: Preexisting CD8+ T-cell immunity to the H7N9 influenza A virus varies across ethnicities.
Abstract: The absence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies specific for the novel A (H7N9) influenza virus indicates a lack of prior human exposure. As influenza A virus-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be broadly cross-reactive, we tested whether immunogenic peptides derived from H7N9 might be recognized by memory CTLs established following infection with other influenza strains. Probing across multiple ethnicities, we identified 32 conserved epitopes derived from the nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix-1 (M1) proteins. These NP and M1 peptides are presented by HLAs prevalent in 16-57% of individuals. Remarkably, some HLA alleles (A*0201, A*0301, B*5701, B*1801, and B*0801) elicit robust CTL responses against any human influenza A virus, including H7N9, whereas ethnicities where HLA-A*0101, A*6801, B*1501, and A*2402 are prominent, show limited CTL response profiles. By this criterion, some groups, especially the Alaskan and Australian Indigenous peoples, would be particularly vulnerable to H7N9 infection. This dissection of CTL-mediated immunity to H7N9 thus suggests strategies for both vaccine delivery and development.

Title: A historical perspective of influenza A(H1N2) virus.
Abstract: The emergence and transition to pandemic status of the influenza A(H1N1)A(H1N1)pdm09) virus in 2009 illustrated the potential for previously circulating human viruses to re-emerge in humans and cause a pandemic after decades of circulating among animals. Within a short time of the initial emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, novel reassortants were isolated from swine. In late 2011, a variant (v) H3N2 subtype was isolated from humans, and by 2012, the number of persons infected began to increase with limited person-to-person transmission. During 2012 in the United States, an A(H1N2)v virus was transmitted to humans from swine. During the same year, Australia recorded its first H1N2 subtype infection among swine. The A(H3N2)v and A(H1N2)v viruses contained the matrix protein from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, raising the possibility of increased transmissibility among humans and underscoring the potential for influenza pandemics of novel swine-origin viruses. We report on the differing histories of A(H1N2) viruses among humans and animals.

Title: Clinical assessment of a novel recombinant simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 as a vectored vaccine expressing conserved Influenza A antigens.
Abstract: Adenoviruses are potent vectors for inducing and boosting cellular immunity to encoded recombinant antigens. However, the widespread seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies to common human adenovirus serotypes limits their use. Simian adenoviruses do not suffer from the same drawbacks. We have constructed a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the conserved influenza antigens, nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix protein 1 (M1). Here, we report safety and T-cell immunogenicity following vaccination with this novel recombinant simian adenovirus, ChAdOx1 NP+M1, in a first in human dose-escalation study using a 3+3 study design, followed by boosting with modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the same antigens in some volunteers. We demonstrate ChAdOx1 NP+M1 to be safe and immunogenic. ChAdOx1 is a promising vaccine vector that could be used to deliver vaccine antigens where strong cellular immune responses are required for protection.

Title: Inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha with etanercept provides protection against lethal H1N1 influenza infection in mice.
Abstract: Factors implicated in influenza-mediated morbidity and mortality include robust cytokine production (cytokine storm), excessive inflammatory infiltrates, and virus-induced tissue destruction. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine present during influenza infection, but it is unclear whether direct inhibition of TNF-α can elicit protection against influenza infection. In this study, the commercially available TNF-α inhibitor etanercept was used to inhibit TNF-α induced by lethal A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) influenza virus infection of mice. The effects of TNF-α inhibition on mouse survival, pathologic changes, immune cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine secretion, Toll-like receptor expression, and activation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling pathway were evaluated. The intranasal delivery of etanercept provided significant protection against mortality (30% of mice survived up to 14 days after infection) in mice treated with etanercept. In contrast, no survivors were found beyond 6 days in mice treated with saline after lethal challenge with H1N1 influenza virus. It was observed that etanercept significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration (for example, macrophages and neutrophils), inflammatory cytokine secretion (for example, interleukin-6, TNF-α, and interferon gamma), and expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-7). Etanercept also downregulated and inhibited the cascade proteins of the NF-κB signaling pathway (for example, MyD88, TRIF, NF-κB, and p65), as well as enhanced host control of virus replication. These findings indicate that etanercept, by blocking TNF-α, can significantly downregulate excessive inflammatory immune responses and provide protection against lethal influenza infection, making its use a novel strategy for controlling severe influenza-induced viral pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study evaluates the effect of TNF-alpha inhibition on influenza infection outcomes but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of three live attenuated H2 pandemic influenza vaccine candidates in mice and ferrets.
Abstract: H2 influenza viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, and therefore a significant portion of the population would be susceptible to infection should H2 influenza viruses reemerge. H2 influenza viruses continue to circulate in avian reservoirs worldwide, and these reservoirs are a potential source from which these viruses could emerge. Three reassortant cold-adapted (ca) H2 pandemic influenza vaccine candidates with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes derived from the wild-type A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) (Jap/57), A/mallard/6750/1978 (H2N2) (mal/78), or A/swine/MO/4296424/2006 (H2N3) (sw/06) viruses and the internal protein gene segments from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca virus were generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics (Jap/57 ca, mal/78 ca, and sw/06 ca, respectively). The vaccine candidates exhibited the in vitro phenotypes of temperature sensitivity and cold adaptation and were restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of ferrets. In mice and ferrets, the vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against homologous wild-type virus challenge. Of the three candidates, the sw/06 ca vaccine elicited cross-reactive antibodies and provided significant protection against the greatest number of heterologous viruses. These observations suggest that the sw/06 ca vaccine should be further evaluated in a clinical trial as an H2 pandemic influenza vaccine candidate. Influenza pandemics arise when novel influenza viruses are introduced into a population with little prior immunity to the new virus and often result in higher rates of illness and death than annual seasonal influenza epidemics. An influenza H2 subtype virus caused a pandemic in 1957, and H2 viruses circulated in humans till 1968. H2 influenza viruses continue to circulate in birds, and the development of an H2 influenza vaccine candidate is therefore considered a priority in preparing for future pandemics. However, we cannot predict whether a human H2 virus will reemerge or a novel avian H2 virus will emerge. We identified three viruses as suitable candidates for further evaluation as vaccines to protect against H2 influenza viruses and evaluated the immune responses and protection that these three vaccines provided in mice and ferrets.

Title: Antiviral activity of lambda interferon in chickens.
Abstract: Interferons (IFNs) are essential components of the antiviral defense system of vertebrates. In mammals, functional receptors for type III IFN (lambda interferon [IFN-λ]) are found mainly on epithelial cells, and IFN-λ was demonstrated to play a crucial role in limiting viral infections of mucosal surfaces. To determine whether IFN-λ plays a similar role in birds, we produced recombinant chicken IFN-λ (chIFN-λ) and we used the replication-competent retroviral RCAS vector system to generate mosaic-transgenic chicken embryos that constitutively express chIFN-λ. We could demonstrate that chIFN-λ markedly inhibited replication of various virus strains, including highly pathogenic influenza A viruses, in ovo and in vivo, as well as in epithelium-rich tissue and cell culture systems. In contrast, chicken fibroblasts responded poorly to chIFN-λ. When applied in vivo to 3-week-old chickens, recombinant chIFN-λ strongly induced the IFN-responsive Mx gene in epithelium-rich organs, such as lungs, tracheas, and intestinal tracts. Correspondingly, these organs were found to express high transcript levels of the putative chIFN-λ receptor alpha chain (chIL28RA) gene. Transfection of chicken fibroblasts with a chIL28RA expression construct rendered these cells responsive to chIFN-λ treatment, indicating that receptor expression determines cell type specificity of IFN-λ action in chickens. Surprisingly, mosaic-transgenic chickens perished soon after hatching, demonstrating a detrimental effect of constitutive chIFN-λ expression. Our data highlight fundamental similarities between the IFN-λ systems of mammals and birds and suggest that type III IFN might play a role in defending mucosal surfaces against viral intruders in most if not all vertebrates.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates antiviral activity of lambda interferon in chickens without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: PhyloFlu, a DNA microarray for determining the phylogenetic origin of influenza A virus gene segments and the genomic fingerprint of viral strains.
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that most influenza A virus gene segments can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the hemagglutinin (HA) subtype of the circulating strains has been closely surveyed, but the reassortment of internal gene segments is usually not monitored as a potential source of an increased pathogenicity. In this work, an oligonucleotide DNA microarray (PhyloFlu) designed to determine the phylogenetic origins of the eight segments of the influenza virus genome was constructed and validated. Clades were defined for each segment and also for the 16 HA and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. Viral genetic material was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with primers specific to the conserved 5' and 3' ends of the influenza A virus genes, followed by PCR amplification with random primers and Cy3 labeling. The microarray unambiguously determined the clades for all eight influenza virus genes in 74% (28/38) of the samples. The microarray was validated with reference strains from different animal origins, as well as from human, swine, and avian viruses from field or clinical samples. In most cases, the phylogenetic clade of each segment defined its animal host of origin. The genomic fingerprint deduced by the combined information of the individual clades allowed for the determination of the time and place that strains with the same genomic pattern were previously reported. PhyloFlu is useful for characterizing and surveying the genetic diversity and variation of animal viruses circulating in different environmental niches and for obtaining a more detailed surveillance and follow up of reassortant events that can potentially modify virus pathogenicity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic origin determination of influenza gene segments and surveillance of genetic diversity, without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Impact of viral drift on vaccination dynamics and patterns of seasonal influenza.
Abstract: Much research has been devoted to the determination of optimal vaccination strategies for seasonal influenza epidemics. However, less attention has been paid to whether this optimization can be achieved within the context of viral drift. We developed a mathematical model that links different intra-seasonal dynamics of vaccination and infection to investigate the effect of viral drift on optimal vaccination for minimizing the total number of infections. The model was computationally implemented using a seasonal force of infection, with estimated parameters from the published literature. Simulation results show that the pattern of large seasonal epidemics is strongly correlated with the duration of specific cross-protection immunity induced by natural infection. Considering a random vaccination, our simulations suggest that the effect of vaccination on epidemic patterns is largely influenced by the duration of protection induced by strain-specific vaccination. We found that the protection efficacy (i.e., reduction of susceptibility to infection) of vaccine is a parameter that could influence these patterns, particularly when the duration of vaccine-induced cross-protection is lengthened. Given the uncertainty in the timing and nature of antigenically drifted variants, the findings highlight the difficulty in determining optimal vaccination dynamics for seasonal epidemics. Our study suggests that the short- and long-term impacts of vaccination on seasonal epidemics should be evaluated within the context of population-pathogen landscape for influenza evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study on vaccination dynamics and viral drift without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Anti-influenza activity of Alchemilla mollis extract: possible virucidal activity against influenza virus particles.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is a major public health problem that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. The emergence of resistance to the currently available anti-influenza agents has necessitated the development of new drugs with novel targets. Studying known ethno-medicinal plants is a promising approach for the discovery of new antiviral compounds. Alchemilla mollis is used in traditional medicine in Europe for different indications, including minimizing the symptoms of a sore throat. In this study, we found that A. mollis extract has anti-influenza activity, and investigated the mechanism underlying its inhibition of influenza virus replication. Plaque assays demonstrated that treatment of cells with A. mollis extract prior to infection did not inhibit influenza virus infection. However, plaque formation was markedly reduced when infected cells were overlaid with an agarose gel containing A. mollis extract. In addition, exposure of the virus to A. mollis extract prior to infection and treatment of cells during virus infection significantly suppressed plaque formation. Influenza virus-induced hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells was inhibited by A. mollis extract treatment. The inhibitory effect was observed against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and H5N2. These findings suggest that A. mollis extract has virucidal or neutralizing activity against influenza virus particles. Furthermore, inhibitory effect of zanamivir synergistically increased after combination with A. mollis extract. Our results suggest that A. mollis extract has the potential to be developed as an antiinfluenza agent.

Title: Characterization of innate responses to influenza virus infection in a novel lung type I epithelial cell model.
Abstract: Type I alveolar epithelial cells are a replicative niche for influenza in vivo, yet their response to infection is not fully understood. To better characterize their cellular responses, we have created an immortalized murine lung epithelial type I cell line (LET1). These cells support spreading influenza virus infection in the absence of exogenous protease and thus permit simultaneous analysis of viral replication dynamics and host cell responses. LET1 cells can be productively infected with human, swine and mouse-adapted strains of influenza virus and exhibit expression of an antiviral transcriptional programme and robust cytokine secretion. We characterized influenza virus replication dynamics and host responses of lung type I epithelial cells and identified the capacity of epithelial cell-derived type I IFN to regulate specific modules of antiviral effectors to establish an effective antiviral state. Together, our results indicate that the type I epithelial cell can play a major role in restricting influenza virus infection without contribution from the haematopoietic compartment.

Title: Characterization of the noncoding regions of the 1918 influenza A H1N1 virus.
Abstract: The terminal noncoding region (NCR) sequences of the eight gene segments of the influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) virus were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Chimeric viruses encoding the open reading frames of the 1918 virus but flanked by either the wild-type 1918 NCR sequences or the NCR sequences of two other H1N1 virus strains, A/WSN/1933 and A/New York/312/2001, were produced. No growth differences between the NCR variant 1918 influenza viruses were noted.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on noncoding regions of the 1918 virus and their effect on viral growth, but no differences in growth were observed, so no explicit genotype-phenotype link is established.

Title: Epidemiological surveillance of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) from poultry in Guangxi Province, Southern China.
Abstract: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) usually causes mild disease or asymptomatic infection in poultry. However, some LPAIV strains can be transmitted to humans and cause severe infection. Genetic rearrangement and recombination of even low pathogenic influenza may generate a novel virus with increased virulence, posing a substantial risk to public health. Southern China is regarded as the world "influenza epicenter", due to a rash of outbreaks of influenza in recent years. In this study, we conducted an epidemiological survey of LPAIV at different live bird markets (LBMs) in Guangxi province, Southern China. From January 2009 to December 2011, we collected 3,121 cotton swab samples of larynx, trachea and cloaca from the poultry at LBMs in Guangxi. Virus isolation, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and RT-PCR were used to detect and subtype LPAIV in the collected samples. Of the 3,121 samples, 336 samples (10.8%) were LPAIV positive, including 54 (1.7%) in chicken and 282 (9.1%) in duck. The identified LPAIV were H3N1, H3N2, H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, H6N8, and H9N2, which are combinations of seven HA subtypes (H1, H3, H4, H6, H9, H10 and H11) and five NA subtypes (N1, N2, N5, N6 and N8). The H3 and H9 subtypes are predominant in the identified LPAIVs. Among the 336 cases, 29 types of mixed infection of different HA subtypes were identified in 87 of the cases (25.9%). The mixed infections may provide opportunities for genetic recombination. Our results suggest that the LPAIV epidemiology in poultry in the Guangxi province in southern China is complicated and highlights the need for further epidemiological and genetic studies of LPAIV in this area.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports epidemiological surveillance and genetic subtyping of LPAIV but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Evaluation of alignment algorithms for discovery and identification of pathogens using RNA-Seq.
Abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an unparallelled opportunity for the characterization and discovery of known and novel viruses. Because viruses are known to have the highest mutation rates when compared to eukaryotic and bacterial organisms, we assess the extent to which eleven well-known alignment algorithms (BLAST, BLAT, BWA, BWA-SW, BWA-MEM, BFAST, Bowtie2, Novoalign, GSNAP, SHRiMP2 and STAR) can be used for characterizing mutated and non-mutated viral sequences--including those that exhibit RNA splicing--in transcriptome samples. To evaluate aligners objectively we developed a realistic RNA-Seq simulation and evaluation framework (RiSER) and propose a new combined score to rank aligners for viral characterization in terms of their precision, sensitivity and alignment accuracy. We used RiSER to simulate both human and viral read sequences and suggest the best set of aligners for viral sequence characterization in human transcriptome samples. Our results show that significant and substantial differences exist between aligners and that a digital-subtraction-based viral identification framework can and should use different aligners for different parts of the process. We determine the extent to which mutated viral sequences can be effectively characterized and show that more sensitive aligners such as BLAST, BFAST, SHRiMP2, BWA-SW and GSNAP can accurately characterize substantially divergent viral sequences with up to 15% overall sequence mutation rate. We believe that the results presented here will be useful to researchers choosing aligners for viral sequence characterization using next-generation sequencing data.

Reason: The study evaluates alignment algorithms for viral sequence characterization but does not address genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: The effects of linkage on comparative estimators of selection.
Abstract: A major goal of molecular evolution is to determine how natural selection has shaped the evolution of a gene. One approach taken by methods such as KA/KS and the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test is to compare the frequency of non-synonymous and synonymous changes. These methods, however, rely on the assumption that a change in frequency of one mutation will not affect changes in frequency of other mutations. We demonstrate that linkage between sites can bias measures of selection based on synonymous and non-synonymous changes. Using forward simulation of a Wright-Fisher process, we show that hitch-hiking of deleterious mutations with advantageous mutations can lead to overestimation of the number of adaptive substitutions, while background selection and clonal interference can distort the site frequency spectrum to obscure the signal for positive selection. We present three diagnostics for detecting these effects of linked selection and apply them to the human influenza (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene. Various forms of linked selection have characteristic effects on MK-type statistics. The extent of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference can be evaluated using the diagnostic statistics presented here. The diagnostics can also be used to determine how well we expect the MK statistics to perform and whether one form of the statistic may be preferable to another.

Title: Migration and persistence of human influenza A viruses, Vietnam, 2001-2008.
Abstract: Understanding global influenza migration and persistence is crucial for vaccine strain selection. Using 240 new human influenza A virus whole genomes collected in Vietnam during 2001-2008, we looked for persistence patterns and migratory connections between Vietnam and other countries. We found that viruses in Vietnam migrate to and from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. We attempted to reduce geographic bias by generating phylogenies subsampled at the year and country levels. However, migration events in these phylogenies were still driven by the presence or absence of sequence data, indicating that an epidemiologic study design that controls for prevalence is required for robust migration analysis. With whole-genome data, most migration events are not detectable from the phylogeny of the hemagglutinin segment alone, although general migratory relationships between Vietnam and other countries are visible in the hemagglutinin phylogeny. It is possible that virus lineages in Vietnam persisted for >1 year.

Title: Topology of viral evolution.
Abstract: The tree structure is currently the accepted paradigm to represent evolutionary relationships between organisms, species or other taxa. However, horizontal, or reticulate, genomic exchanges are pervasive in nature and confound characterization of phylogenetic trees. Drawing from algebraic topology, we present a unique evolutionary framework that comprehensively captures both clonal and reticulate evolution. We show that whereas clonal evolution can be summarized as a tree, reticulate evolution exhibits nontrivial topology of dimension greater than zero. Our method effectively characterizes clonal evolution, reassortment, and recombination in RNA viruses. Beyond detecting reticulate evolution, we succinctly recapitulate the history of complex genetic exchanges involving more than two parental strains, such as the triple reassortment of H7N9 avian influenza and the formation of circulating HIV-1 recombinants. In addition, we identify recurrent, large-scale patterns of reticulate evolution, including frequent PB2-PB1-PA-NP cosegregation during avian influenza reassortment. Finally, we bound the rate of reticulate events (i.e., 20 reassortments per year in avian influenza). Our method provides an evolutionary perspective that not only captures reticulate events precluding phylogeny, but also indicates the evolutionary scales where phylogenetic inference could be accurate.
Relevant: False

Title: Immune activation and viral replication after vaccination with an influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccine in HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Abstract: Immunization with a pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 was recommended for HIV-infected patients. However, there is limited information concerning the impact of immunization with this vaccine on immune activation and HIV viral replication. In this study, 45 HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving antiretroviral therapy were immunized with a 2-dose series of nonadjuvated monovalent influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccine upon enrollment and approximately 1 month later. Immunogenicity was determined by haemagglutination inhibition assay. The level of immune activation was determined by identification of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ T cells. Patients were divided into 2 groups which include patients who had an undetectable HIV viral load (HIV detectable group) and patients who show virological failure (HIV nondetectable group). The results showed seroconversion rate of 55.2% in HIV nondetectable group, whereas 31.3% was found in HIV detectable group. Both groups of patients showed no major increase in immune activation after immunization. Interestingly, a decrease in the frequency of CD8+ T cells that coexpressed CD38 and HLA-DR was observed after immunization in both groups of patients. We suggested that immunization with influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccine can induce immune response to the pandemic virus without major impact on HIV viral replication and immune activation.

Title: A new piece in the puzzle of the novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus.
Abstract: Using phylogenetic analysis on newly available sequences, we characterize A/chicken/Jiangsu/RD5/2013(H10N9) as currently closest precursor strain for the NA segment in the novel avian-origin H7N9 virus responsible for an outbreak in China. We also show that the internal segments of this precursor strain are closely related to those of the presumed precursor for the HA segment, A/duck/Zhejiang/12/2011(H7N3), which indicates that the sources of both HA and NA donors for the reassortant virus are of regional and not migratory-bird origin and highlights the role of chicken already in the early reassortment events.

Title: Activation of influenza A viruses by host proteases from swine airway epithelium.
Abstract: Pigs are important natural hosts of influenza A viruses, and due to their susceptibility to swine, avian, and human viruses, they may serve as intermediate hosts supporting adaptation and genetic reassortment. Cleavage of the influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. Most influenza viruses, including human and swine viruses, are activated at a monobasic HA cleavage site, and we previously identified TMPRSS2 and HAT to be relevant proteases present in human airways. We investigated the proteolytic activation of influenza viruses in primary porcine tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells (PTEC and PBEC, respectively). Human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses replicated efficiently in PTECs and PBECs, and viruses containing cleaved HA were released from infected cells. Moreover, the cells supported the proteolytic activation of HA at the stage of entry. We found that swine proteases homologous to TMPRSS2 and HAT, designated swTMPRSS2 and swAT, respectively, were expressed in several parts of the porcine respiratory tract. Both proteases cloned from primary PBECs were shown to activate HA with a monobasic cleavage site upon coexpression and support multicycle replication of influenza viruses. swAT was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, where it was present as an active protease that mediated activation of incoming virus. In contrast, swTMPRSS2 accumulated in the trans-Golgi network, suggesting that it cleaves HA in this compartment. In conclusion, our data show that HA activation in porcine airways may occur by similar proteases and at similar stages of the viral life cycle as in human airways.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes host proteases activating influenza virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Newly emerging mutations in the matrix genes of the human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses reduce the detection sensitivity of real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
Abstract: New variants of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were detected in Taiwan between 2012 and 2013. Some of these variants were not detected in clinical specimens using a common real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay that targeted the conserved regions of the viral matrix (M) genes. An analysis of the M gene sequences of the new variants revealed that several newly emerging mutations were located in the regions where the primers or probes of the real-time RT-PCR assay bind; these included three mutations (G225A, T228C, and G238A) in the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, as well as one mutation (C163T) in the A(H3N2) virus. These accumulated mismatch mutations, together with the previously identified C154T mutation of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and the C153T and G189T mutations of the A(H3N2) virus, result in a reduced detection sensitivity for the real-time RT-PCR assay. To overcome the loss of assay sensitivity due to mismatch mutations, we established a real-time RT-PCR assay using degenerate nucleotide bases in both the primers and probe and successfully increased the sensitivity of the assay to detect circulating variants of the human influenza A viruses. Our observations highlight the importance of the simultaneous use of different gene-targeting real-time RT-PCR assays for the clinical diagnosis of influenza.
Relevant: False

Title: Molecular epidemiology of influenza A virus infection in Cyprus in four consecutive seasons (2009 pandemic-2013).
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of influenza A virus infection in Cyprus from the 2009 pandemic until 2013. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus infections outnumbered infections with other respiratory viruses until the end of 2009. The pandemic virus was also the prevalent influenza strain during influenza season 2010-2011; however, it was completely replaced by H3N2 subtype in the next season. During the most recent influenza season, 2012-2013, the pandemic strain was once again the only influenza A virus circulating in Cyprus. Full-length neuraminidase gene sequencing revealed mutations that had previously been identified as permissive. No significant difference in the expression of the IFN-inducible genes OAS and IFIT1 were observed. The phylogenetic analysis of the neuraminidase gene sequences revealed a picture of continuous importation of influenza strains in the island of Cyprus with local circulation playing only a minor role in determining the prevalent strain of the next influenza season.

Title: Inhibition of influenza A virus infection in vitro by peptides designed in silico.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are enveloped, segmented negative single-stranded RNA viruses, capable of causing severe human respiratory infections. Currently, only two types of drugs are used to treat influenza A infections, the M2 H(+) ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Moreover, the emergence of drug-resistant influenza A virus strains has emphasized the need to develop new antiviral agents to complement or replace the existing drugs. Influenza A virus has on the surface a glycoprotein named hemagglutinin (HA) which due to its important role in the initial stage of infection: receptor binding and fusion activities of viral and endosomal membranes, is a potential target for new antiviral drugs. In this work we designed nine peptides using several bioinformatics tools. These peptides were derived from the HA1 and HA2 subunits of influenza A HA with the aim to inhibit influenza A virus infection. The peptides were synthetized and their antiviral activity was tested in vitro against several influenza A viral strains: Puerto Rico/916/34 (H1N1), (H1N1)pdm09, swine (H1N1) and avian (H5N2). We found these peptides were able to inhibit the influenza A viral strains tested, without showing any cytotoxic effect. By docking studies we found evidence that all the peptides were capable to bind to the viral HA, principally to important regions on the viral HA stalk, thus could prevent the HA conformational changes required to carry out its membranes fusion activity.

Title: Treatment with the reactive oxygen species scavenger EUK-207 reduces lung damage and increases survival during 1918 influenza virus infection in mice.
Abstract: The 1918 influenza pandemic caused over 40 million deaths worldwide, with 675,000 deaths in the United States alone. Studies in several experimental animal models showed that 1918 influenza virus infection resulted in severe lung pathology associated with dysregulated immune and cell death responses. To determine if reactive oxygen species produced by host inflammatory responses play a central role in promoting severity of lung pathology, we treated 1918 influenza virus-infected mice with the catalytic catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic, salen-manganese complex EUK-207 beginning 3 days postinfection. Postexposure treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of the 1918 influenza virus with EUK-207 resulted in significantly increased survival and reduced lung pathology without a reduction in viral titers. In vitro studies also showed that EUK-207 treatment did not affect 1918 influenza viral replication. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduction in the detection of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 and the oxidative stress marker 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in lungs of EUK-207-treated animals compared to vehicle controls. High-throughput sequencing and RNA expression microarray analysis revealed that treatment resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory response genes and increased lung metabolic and repair responses. These results directly demonstrate that 1918 influenza virus infection leads to an immunopathogenic immune response with excessive inflammatory and cell death responses that can be limited by treatment with the catalytic antioxidant EUK-207.

Title: Targeting cell division cycle 25 homolog B to regulate influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a worldwide global health concern causing seasonal morbidity mortality and economic burden. Chemotherapeutics is available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant influenza virus strains has reduced its efficacy. Thus, there is a need to discover novel antiviral agents. In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to screen host genes required for influenza virus replication. One pro-influenza virus host gene identified was dual-specificity phosphatase cell division cycle 25 B (CDC25B). RNAi screening of CDC25B resulted in reduced influenza A virus replication, and a CDC25B small-molecule inhibitor (NSC95397) inhibited influenza A virus replication in a dose-dependent fashion. Viral RNA synthesis was reduced by NSC95397 in favor of increased beta interferon (IFN-β) expression, and NSC95397 was found to interfere with nuclear localization and chromatin association of NS1, an influenza virus protein. As NS1 has been shown to be chromatin associated and to suppress host transcription, it is likely that CDC25B supports NS1 nuclear function to hijack host transcription machinery in favor of viral RNA synthesis, a process that is blocked by NSC95397. Importantly, NSC95397 treatment protects mice against lethal influenza virus challenge. The findings establish CDC25B as a pro-influenza A virus host factor that may be targeted as a novel influenza A therapeutic strategy.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host gene CDC25B's role in influenza virus replication and antiviral strategies, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Pooled RNAi screen identifies ubiquitin ligase Itch as crucial for influenza A virus release from the endosome during virus entry.
Abstract: Influenza viruses, like other viruses, rely on host factors to support their life cycle as viral proteins usually "hijack," or collaborate with, cellular proteins to execute their functions. Identification and understanding of these factors can increase the knowledge of molecular mechanisms manipulated by the viruses and facilitate development of antiviral drugs. To this end, we developed a unique genome-wide pooled shRNA screen to search for cellular factors important for influenza A virus (IAV) replication. We identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Itch, as an essential factor for an early step in the viral life cycle. In Itch knockdown cells, the incorporation of viral ribonucleoprotein complex into endosomes was normal, but its subsequent release from endosomes and transport to the nucleus was retarded. In addition, upon virus infection, Itch was phosphorylated and recruited to the endosomes, where virus particles were located. Furthermore, Itch interacted with viral M1 protein and ubiquitinated M1 protein. Collectively, our findings unravel a critical role of Itch in mediating IAV release from the endosome and offer insights into the mechanism for IAV uncoating during virus entry. These findings also highlight the feasibility of pooled RNAi screening for exploring the cellular cofactors of lytic viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host ubiquitin ligase Itch's role in influenza virus entry and uncoating, without explicit analysis of viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Abstract: Influenza is a common infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Annual epidemics cause severe illnesses, deaths, and economic loss around the world. To better defend against influenza viral infection, it is essential to understand its mechanisms and associated host responses. Many studies have been conducted to elucidate these mechanisms, however, the overall picture remains incompletely understood. A systematic understanding of influenza viral infection in host cells is needed to facilitate the identification of influential host response mechanisms and potential drug targets. We constructed a comprehensive map of the influenza A virus ('IAV') life cycle ('FluMap') by undertaking a literature-based, manual curation approach. Based on information obtained from publicly available pathway databases, updated with literature-based information and input from expert virologists and immunologists, FluMap is currently composed of 960 factors (i.e., proteins, mRNAs etc.) and 456 reactions, and is annotated with ~500 papers and curation comments. In addition to detailing the type of molecular interactions, isolate/strain specific data are also available. The FluMap was built with the pathway editor CellDesigner in standard SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format and visualized as an SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation) diagram. It is also available as a web service (online map) based on the iPathways+ system to enable community discussion by influenza researchers. We also demonstrate computational network analyses to identify targets using the FluMap. The FluMap is a comprehensive pathway map that can serve as a graphically presented knowledge-base and as a platform to analyze functional interactions between IAV and host factors. Publicly available webtools will allow continuous updating to ensure the most reliable representation of the host-virus interaction network. The FluMap is available at http://www.influenza-x.org/flumap/.

Reason: Presents a comprehensive map of influenza A virus replication cycle and host interactions, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Pathogenicity of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in immunocompromised cynomolgus macaques.
Abstract: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus spread throughout the world since most people did not have immunity against the virus. In the post pandemic phase when many humans might possess immunity against the pandemic virus, one of the concerns is infection in immunocompromised people. Therefore, we used an immunosuppressed macaque model to examine pathogenicity of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus under an immunocompromised condition. The virus in nasal samples of immunosuppressed macaques infected with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was detected longer after infection than was the virus in nasal samples of immunocompetent macaques. As expected, not only virus amounts but also virus propagation sites in the immunosuppressed macaques were larger than those in lungs of the immunocompetent macaques when they were infected with the pandemic virus. Immunosuppressed macaques possessed low levels of immune cells producing cytokines and chemokines, but levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokine interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in lungs of the immunosuppressed macaques were higher than those in lungs of the immunocompetent macaques, though the differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, under an immunosuppressive condition, the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus might cause more severe morbidity with high cytokine/chemokine production by the host innate immune system than that seen in macaques under the immunocompetent condition.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on pathogenicity of pandemic H1N1 virus in immunocompromised macaques but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Population susceptibility to North American and Eurasian swine influenza viruses in England, at three time points between 2004 and 2011.
Abstract: Age-stratified sera collected in 2004, 2008 and 2010 in England were evaluated for antibody to swine influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses from the United States or Europe as a measure of population susceptibility to the emergence of novel viruses. Children under 11 years of age had little or no measurable antibody to recent swine H3N2 viruses despite their high levels of antibody to recent H3N2 seasonal human strains. Adolescents and young adults (born 1968–1999) had higher antibody levels to swine H3N2 viruses. Antibody levels to swine H3N2 influenza show little correlation with exposure to recent seasonal H3N2 (A/Perth/16/2009) strains, but with antibody to older H3N2 strains represented by A/Wuhan/359/1995. Children had the highest seropositivity to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and young adults had the lowest antibody levels to A/Perth/16/2009. No age group showed substantial antibody levels to A/Aragon/RR3218/2008, a European swine H1N1 virus belonging to the Eurasian lineage. After vaccination with contemporary trivalent vaccine we observed evidence of boosted reactivity to swine H3N2 viruses in children and adults, while only a limited boosting effect on antibody levels to A/Aragon/RR3218/2008 was observed in both groups. Overall, our results suggest that different vaccination strategies may be necessary according to age if swine viruses emerge as a significant pandemic threat.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper assesses population antibody susceptibility to swine influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Severe influenza outbreak in Western Ukraine in 2009--a molecular-epidemiological study.
Abstract: In the autumn of 2009 the authors participated in a humanitarian operation in Western Ukraine by undertaking an epidemiological investigation of an influenza-like-illness (ILI) in the L'viv Oblast region. Mobile biological survey teams took samples from civilian patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, rapid transportation of the samples, and their molecular analysis in Poland to provide accurate results. The aim of the study was the molecular and epidemiological analysis of the biological samples collected. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), multiplex PCR techniques, traditional Sanger Sequencing and classical viral culture methods were used. Among the 124 influenza-like illness cases, ~50% (58) were positive for influenza A virus in WHO-CDC molecular assay, including subtyping. The specimens were further analyzed to confirm results and determine the genetic sequence. Phylogenetically, the nucleotide similarity of both the Ukraine specimens and reference A/California/7/2009 (pH1N1) was 99.2-99.3%. Oseltamivir resistance was not registered. HA1 region characterization showed an overall protein identity of 98.5-99.4%. An unexpected high contribution of influenza A was confirmed among ILI patients, as well as a very limited number of other detected viruses, indicate that the 2009 epidemic in western Ukraine was strongly related to novel influenza A/H1N1. The importance of swift sharing of information and reference laboratories networking in surveillance, as well as serving governments and international agencies in pursuing adequate actions, should be stressed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study is a molecular-epidemiological investigation of influenza outbreak without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Heterogeneity of the MDCK cell line and its applicability for influenza virus research.
Abstract: Single-cell clones have been established from the MDCK cell line, characterized for their morphology and evaluated for their suitability for influenza virus research. Three discrete cell morphotypes were identified using light microscopy. Besides morphological features, the cell types can be distinguished by the level of expression of surface glycans recognized by peanut agglutinin (PNA). All clones were susceptible to infection by influenza viruses of different subtypes of influenza A virus (H1N1, H1N1pdm09, H3N2, H5N1) and influenza B virus, and all possessed on their surface terminally sialylated glycans with both types of glycosidic linkage (α2-3 and α2-6). The Type-1 cell lines were able to support a multicycle replication of influenza A and B viruses without help of an exogenous trypsin. In contrast, cell lines exhibiting Type-2 morphology were unable to support multicycle replication of influenza A viruses without trypsin supplementation. Western blot analysis of the hemagglutinin of H1N1 strains demonstrated that Type-2 cells were deficient in production of proteolytically activated hemagglutinin (no cleavage between HA1/HA2 was observed). HA1/HA2 cleavage of influenza B viruses in the Type-2 cells was also significantly impaired, but not completely abrogated, producing sufficient amount of activated HA to support efficient virus replication without trypsin. In contrast, all clones of Type-1 cells were able to produce proteolytically activated hemagglutinin of influenza A and B viruses. However, the growth kinetics and plaque size of influenza A viruses varied significantly in different clones. Influenza B virus also showed different plaque size, with the biggest plaque formation in the Type-2 cells, although the growth kinetics and peak infectivity titers were similar in all clones. Taken together, the study demonstrates that the population of original MDCK cells is represented by various types of cells that differ in their capacities to support replication of influenza A and B viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes heterogeneity of MDCK cell lines for influenza virus research but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Effectiveness of influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza, in the late 2011-2012 season in Spain, among population targeted for vaccination.
Abstract: In Spain, the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated in the last three seasons using the observational study cycEVA conducted in the frame of the existing Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System. The objective of the study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) among the target groups for vaccination in Spain in the 2011-2012 season. We also studied influenza VE in the early (weeks 52/2011-7/2012) and late (weeks 8-14/2012) phases of the epidemic and according to time since vaccination. Medically attended patients with ILI were systematically swabbed to collect information on exposure, laboratory outcome and confounding factors. Patients belonging to target groups for vaccination and who were swabbed <8 days after symptom onset were included. Cases tested positive for influenza and controls tested negative for any influenza virus. To examine the effect of a late season, analyses were performed according to the phase of the season and according to the time between vaccination and symptoms onset. The overall adjusted influenza VE against A(H3N2) was 45% (95% CI, 0-69). The estimated influenza VE was 52% (95% CI, -3 to 78), 40% (95% CI, -40 to 74) and 22% (95% CI, -135 to 74) at 3.5 months, 3.5-4 months, and >4 months, respectively, since vaccination. A decrease in VE with time since vaccination was only observed in individuals aged ≥ 65 years. Regarding the phase of the season, decreasing point estimates were only observed in the early phase, whereas very low or null estimates were obtained in the late phase for the shortest time interval. The 2011-2012 influenza vaccine showed a low-to-moderate protective effect against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in the target groups for vaccination, in a late season and with a limited match between the vaccine and circulating strains. The suggested decrease in influenza VE with time since vaccination was mostly observed in the elderly population. The decreasing protective effect of the vaccine in the late part of the season could be related to waning vaccine protection because no viral changes were identified throughout the season.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness in a population without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Identification and expression profiling analysis of goose melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) gene.
Abstract: Melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) is an important cytoplasmic receptor that recognizes long molecules of viral double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA with 5' triphosphate and mediates type I interferon secretion. In this study, the full-length MDA5 gene in the goose was identified and characterized. The cDNA of goose MDA5 was 3,306 bp in length with an open reading frame of 3,018 bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 1,005 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 6 main structure domains including 2 caspase activation and recruitment domains, one DExD/H-box helicase domain, one type III restriction enzyme domain, one helicase conserved C-terminal domain, and one RIG-I C-terminal domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that goose MDA5 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all sampled tissues. It was highly expressed in the jejunum, trachea, ileum, colon, and kidney, and lowly expressed in the muscular stomach, glandular stomach, and muscle. A significant increase in the transcription of MDA5 was detected in the brain, spleen, and lungs of geese after infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus compared with uninfected tissues. These findings indicated that goose MDA5 was an important receptor, involved in the antiviral innate immune defense to H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in geese.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies and profiles expression of the MDA5 gene in geese and its response to H5N1 infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Continuous influenza virus production in cell culture shows a periodic accumulation of defective interfering particles.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are a major public health burden during seasonal epidemics and a continuous threat due to their potential to cause pandemics. Annual vaccination provides the best protection against the contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. However, the current production capacities for influenza vaccines are insufficient to meet the increasing demands. We explored the possibility to establish a continuous production process for influenza viruses using the duck-derived suspension cell line AGE1.CR. A two-stage bioreactor setup was designed in which cells were cultivated in a first stirred tank reactor where an almost constant cell concentration was maintained. Cells were then constantly fed to a second bioreactor where virus infection and replication took place. Using this two-stage reactor system, it was possible to continuously produce influenza viruses. Surprisingly, virus titers showed a periodic increase and decrease during the run-time of 17 days. These titer fluctuations were caused by the presence of defective interfering particles (DIPs), which we detected by PCR. Mathematical modeling confirmed this observation showing that constant virus titers can only emerge in the absence of DIPs. Even with very low amounts of DIPs in the seed virus and very low rates for de novo DIP generation, defective viruses rapidly accumulate and, therefore, represent a serious challenge for continuous vaccine production. Yet, the continuous replication of influenza virus using a two-stage bioreactor setup is a novel tool to study aspects of viral evolution and the impact of DIPs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on continuous virus production and defective interfering particles but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Visualizing influenza virus infection in living mice.
Abstract: Preventing and treating influenza virus infection remain a challenge because of incomplete understanding of the host-pathogen interactions, limited therapeutics and lack of a universal vaccine. So far, methods for monitoring the course of infection with influenza virus in real time in living animals are lacking. Here we report the visualization of influenza viral infection in living mice using an engineered replication-competent influenza A virus carrying luciferase reporter gene. After intranasal inoculation, bioluminescence can be detected in the chest and nasopharyngeal passage of living mice. The intensity of bioluminescence in the chest correlates with the dosage of infection and the viral load in the lung. Bioluminescence in the chest of infected mice diminishes on antiviral treatment. This work provides a novel approach that enables real-time study of influenza virus infection and effects of antiviral therapeutics in living animals.

Title: Human (α2→6) and avian (α2→3) sialylated receptors of influenza A virus show distinct conformations and dynamics in solution.
Abstract: Differential interactions between influenza A virus protein hemagglutinin (HA) and α2→3 (avian) or α2→6 (human) sialylated glycan receptors play an important role in governing host specificity and adaptation of the virus. Previous analysis of HA-glycan interactions with trisaccharides showed that, in addition to the terminal sialic acid linkage, the conformation and topology of the glycans, while they are bound to HA, are key factors in regulating these interactions. Here, the solution conformation and dynamics of two representative avian and human glycan pentasaccharide receptors [LSTa, Neu5Ac-α(2→3)-Gal-β(1→3)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc; LSTc, (Neu5Ac-α(2→6)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc] have been explored using nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulation. Analyses demonstrate that, in solution, human and avian receptors sample distinct conformations, topologies, and dynamics. These unique features of avian and human receptors in solution could represent distinct molecular characteristics for recognition by HA, thereby providing the HA-glycan interaction specificity in influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes conformations of sialylated receptors in solution but does not directly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Engaging the normative question in the H5N1 avian influenza mutation experiments.
Abstract: In recent time there has been ample discussion concerning censorship of research conducted in two labs involved in avian influenza virus research. Much of the debate has centered on the question whether the methods and results should reach to open disclosure given the "dual use" nature of this research which can be used for nefarious purposes. This paper reviews the discussion to date but centers on epistemological issues associated with initial justification of this research and what this entails for continuation of this research despite US governmental biosecurity concerns. The question here is whether there was reasonable moral warrant for genetic alteration of the H5N1 influenza virus. The paper concludes with philosophical (ethical) justification for continuation of this research.

Reason: This is a philosophical/ethical discussion about H5N1 mutation experiments, not reporting genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Genome-wide fitness profiling reveals adaptations required by Haemophilus in coinfection with influenza A virus in the murine lung.
Abstract: Bacterial coinfection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in epidemics of influenza A virus (IAV). The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae typically colonizes the human upper respiratory tract without causing disease, and yet in individuals infected with IAV, it can cause debilitating or lethal secondary pneumonia. Studies in murine models have detected immune components involved in susceptibility and pathology, and yet few studies have examined bacterial factors contributing to coinfection. We conducted genome-wide profiling of the H. influenzae genes that promote its fitness in a murine model of coinfection with IAV. Application of direct, high-throughput sequencing of transposon insertion sites revealed fitness phenotypes of a bank of H. influenzae mutants in viral coinfection in comparison with bacterial infection alone. One set of virulence genes was required in nonvirally infected mice but not in coinfection, consistent with a defect in anti-bacterial defenses during coinfection. Nevertheless, a core set of genes required in both in vivo conditions indicated that many bacterial countermeasures against host defenses remain critical for coinfection. The results also revealed a subset of genes required in coinfection but not in bacterial infection alone, including the iron-sulfur cluster regulator gene, iscR, which was required for oxidative stress resistance. Overexpression of the antioxidant protein Dps in the iscR mutant restored oxidative stress resistance and ability to colonize in coinfection. The results identify bacterial stress and metabolic adaptations required in an IAV coinfection model, revealing potential targets for treatment or prevention of secondary bacterial pneumonia after viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper profiles bacterial gene fitness during coinfection with influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of three influenza neuraminidase inhibition assays for use in a public health laboratory setting during the 2011-2012 influenza season.
Abstract: We evaluated the implementation of three commercially available neuraminidase inhibition assays in a public health laboratory (PHL) setting. We also described the drug susceptibility patterns of human influenza A and B circulating in Maryland during the 2011-2012 influenza season. From January to May 2012, 169 influenza virus isolates were tested for phenotypic susceptibility to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir using NA-Fluor(TM), NA-Star®, and NA-XTD(TM) concurrently. A 50% neuraminidase inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated to determine drug susceptibility. We used the standard deviation based on the median absolute deviation of the median analysis to determine the potential for reduced drug susceptibility. We evaluated each assay for the use of resources in high- and low-volume testing scenarios. One of the 25 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic isolates tested was resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir, and sensitive to zanamivir, on all three platforms. Eighty-two influenza A (H3N2) and 62 B isolates were sensitive to all three drugs in all three assays. For a low-volume scenario, NA-Star and NA-XTD took 120 minutes to complete, while NA-Fluor required 300 minutes to complete. The lowest relative cost favored NA-Star. In a high-volume scenario, NA-Fluor had the highest throughput. Reagent use was most efficient when maximizing throughput. Cost efficiency from low- to high-volume testing improved the most for NA-Star. Our evaluation showed that both chemiluminescent and fluorescent neuraminidase inhibition assays can be successfully implemented in a PHL setting to screen circulating influenza strains for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. For improved PHL influenza surveillance, it may be essential to develop guidelines for phenotypic drug-resistance testing that take into consideration a PHL's workload and available resources.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates neuraminidase inhibition assays and drug susceptibility patterns but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bacterial lipopolysaccharide inhibits influenza virus infection of human macrophages and the consequent induction of CD8+ T cell immunity.
Abstract: It is well established that infection with influenza A virus (IAV) facilitates secondary bacterial disease. However, there is a growing body of evidence that the microbial context in which IAV infection occurs can affect both innate and adaptive responses to the virus. To date, these studies have been restricted to murine models of disease and the relevance of these findings in primary human cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that pre-stimulation of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with the bacterial ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduces the ability of IAV to infect these cells. The inhibition of IAV infection was associated with a reduced transcription of viral RNA and the ability of LPS to induce an anti-viral/type I interferon response in human MDMs. We demonstrated that this reduced rate of viral infection is associated with a reduced ability to present a model antigen to autologous CD8+ T cells. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that exposure to bacterial ligands like LPS can play an important role in modulating the immune response of primary human immune cells towards IAV infection, which may then have important consequences for the development of the host's adaptive immune response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on how bacterial lipopolysaccharide affects influenza virus infection and immune response in human macrophages, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance of human influenza A(H3N2) virus from 1999 to 2009 in southern Italy.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of influenza virus co-infections in humans and changes in the genetic variability of A(H3N2) virus strains in southern Italy from 1999 to 2009. A partial sequence of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene by human influenza H3N2 strains identified in oropharyngeal swabs from patients with influenza-like illness was analysed by DNA sequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. During the seasons 1999-2000, 2002-2003, 2004-2005 and 2008-2009, the influenza viruses circulating belonged to subtype H3N2. However, A(H1N1) subtype virus and B type were respectively prevalent during the 2000-2001, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006 seasons. The HA sequences appeared to be closely related to the sequence of the influenza A vaccine strain. Only the 2002-2003 season was characterized by co-circulation of two viral lineages: A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like virus of the previous season and A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like virus, a new H3 variant. In this study, over the decade analysed, no significant change was seen in the sequences of the HA gene of H3 viruses isolated.

Title: Influenza infection results in local expansion of memory CD8(+) T cells with antigen non-specific phenotype and function.
Abstract: Primary viral infections induce activation of CD8(+) T cells responsible for effective resistance. We sought to characterize the nature of the CD8(+) T cell expansion observed after primary viral infection with influenza. Infection of naive mice with different strains of influenza resulted in the rapid expansion of memory CD8(+) T cells exhibiting a unique bystander phenotype with significant up-regulation of natural killer group 2D (NKG2D), but not CD25, on the CD44(high) CD8(+) T cells, suggesting an antigen non-specific phenotype. We further confirmed the non-specificity of this phenotype on ovalbumin-specific (OT-I) CD8(+) T cells, which are not specific to influenza. These non-specific CD8(+) T cells also displayed increased lytic capabilities and were observed primarily in the lung. Thus, influenza infection was shown to induce a rapid, antigen non-specific memory T cell expansion which is restricted to the specific site of inflammation. In contrast, CD8(+) T cells of a similar phenotype could be observed in other organs following administration of systemic agonistic anti-CD40 and interleukin-2 immunotherapy, demonstrating that bystander expansion in multiple sites is possible depending on whether the nature of activation is either acute or systemic. Finally, intranasal blockade of NKG2D resulted in a significant increase in viral replication early during the course of infection, suggesting that NKG2D is a critical mediator of anti-influenza responses prior to the initiation of adaptive immunity. These results characterize further the local bystander expansion of tissue-resident, memory CD8(+) T cells which, due to their early induction, may play an important NKG2D-mediated, antigen non-specific role during the early stages of viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on CD8+ T cell responses to influenza infection without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antigen-activated dendritic cells ameliorate influenza A infections.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need for alternative or adjunct therapies, as resistance to currently used antiviral drugs is emerging rapidly. We tested ligand epitope antigen presentation system (LEAPS) technology as a new immune-based treatment for influenza virus infection in a mouse model. Influenza-J-LEAPS peptides were synthesized by conjugating the binding ligand derived from the β2-microglobulin chain of the human MHC class I molecule (J-LEAPS) with 15 to 30 amino acid-long peptides derived from influenza virus NP, M, or HA proteins. DCs were stimulated with influenza-J-LEAPS peptides (influenza-J-LEAPS) and injected intravenously into infected mice. Antigen-specific LEAPS-stimulated DCs were effective in reducing influenza virus replication in the lungs and enhancing survival of infected animals. Additionally, they augmented influenza-specific T cell responses in the lungs and reduced the severity of disease by limiting excessive cytokine responses, which are known to contribute to morbidity and mortality following influenza virus infection. Our data demonstrate that influenza-J-LEAPS-pulsed DCs reduce virus replication in the lungs, enhance survival, and modulate the protective immune responses that eliminate the virus while preventing excessive cytokines that could injure the host. This approach shows promise as an adjunct to antiviral treatment of influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study tests dendritic cell-based immunotherapy against influenza infection without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Host genetic determinants of influenza pathogenicity.
Abstract: Despite effective vaccines, influenza remains a major global health threat due to the morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal epidemics, as well as the 2009 pandemic. Also of profound concern are the rare but potentially catastrophic transmissions of avian influenza to humans, highlighted by a recent H7N9 influenza outbreak. Murine and human studies reveal that the clinical course of influenza is the result of a combination of both host and viral genetic determinants. While viral pathogenicity has long been the subject of intensive efforts, research to elucidate host genetic determinants, particularly human, is now in the ascendant, and the goal of this review is to highlight these recent insights.

Title: The genome-packaging signal of the influenza A virus genome comprises a genome incorporation signal and a genome-bundling signal.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome comprises eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments (vRNAs). All eight vRNAs are selectively packaged into each progeny virion via so-called segment-specific genome-packaging signal sequences that are located in the noncoding and terminal coding regions of both the 3' and the 5' ends of the vRNAs. However, it remains unclear how these signals ensure that eight different vRNAs are packaged. Here, by using a reverse genetics system, we demonstrated that, in the absence of the other seven vRNAs, a recombinant NP vRNA bearing only a reporter gene flanked by the noncoding NP regions was incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) as efficiently as a recombinant NP vRNA bearing the reporter gene flanked by the complete NP packaging signals (i.e., the noncoding sequences and the terminal coding regions). Viruses that comprised a recombinant NP vRNA whose packaging signal was disrupted, and the remaining seven authentic vRNAs, did not undergo multiple cycles of replication; however, a recombinant NP vRNA with only the noncoding regions was readily incorporated into VLPs, suggesting that the packaging signal as currently defined is not necessarily essential for the packaging of the vRNA in which it resides; rather, it is required for the packaging of the full set of vRNAs. We propose that the 3' and 5' noncoding regions of each vRNA bear a virion incorporation signal for that vRNA and that the terminal coding regions serve as a bundling signal that ensures the incorporation of the complete set of eight vRNAs into the virion.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genome-packaging signals and their role in viral RNA incorporation and bundling, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes such as virulence or replication efficiency.

Title: Efficient influenza A virus replication in the respiratory tract requires signals from TLR7 and RIG-I.
Abstract: Induction of a proinflammatory response is the hallmark of host innate defense against invading pathogens. Host recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) infection relies on pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) for the activation of innate-immune responses. Here, we show that following a physiological low dose of IAV infection, viral sensing by either TLR7 or RIG-I induces a proinflammatory program that promotes viral replication. Transfer of bronchoalveolar lavage from infected wild-type mice into the airway of mice deficient in TLR7 and RIG-I pathways was sufficient to restore viral replication efficiency. Comparison of IAV-infected cells revealed that inflammatory mediators elicited by TLR7 and RIG-I signaling recruit viral target cells to the airway, thereby enhancing viral load within the respiratory tract. Our data suggest that IAV uses physiological levels of inflammatory responses for its replicative advantage and highlight the complex interplay between viruses and the host innate-immune responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host innate immune receptors (TLR7 and RIG-I) and their role in viral replication, without direct analysis of viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Bioluminescence-based neuraminidase inhibition assay for monitoring influenza virus drug susceptibility in clinical specimens.
Abstract: The QFlu prototype bioluminescence-based neuraminidase (NA) inhibition (NI) assay kit was designed to detect NA inhibitor (NAI)-resistant influenza viruses at point of care. Here, we evaluated its suitability for drug susceptibility assessment at a surveillance laboratory. A comprehensive panel of reference viruses (n = 14) and a set of 90 seasonal influenza virus A and B isolates were included for testing with oseltamivir and/or zanamivir in the QFlu assay using the manufacturer-recommended protocol and a modified version attuned to surveillance requirements. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) generated were compared with those of NI assays currently used for monitoring influenza drug susceptibility, the fluorescent (FL) and chemiluminescent (CL) assays. To provide proof of principle, clinical specimens (n = 235) confirmed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to contain influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 and prescreened for the oseltamivir resistance marker H275Y using pyrosequencing were subsequently tested in the QFlu assay. All three NI assays were able to discriminate the reference NA variants and their matching wild-type viruses based on the difference in their IC50s. Unless the antigenic types were first identified, certain NA variants (e.g., H3N2 with E119V) could be detected among seasonal viruses using the FL assays only. Notably, the QFlu assay identified oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses carrying the H275Y marker directly in clinical specimens, which is not feasible with the other two phenotypic assays, which required prior virus culturing in cells. Furthermore, The QFlu assay allows detection of the influenza virus A and B isolates carrying established and potential NA inhibitor resistance markers and may become a useful tool for monitoring drug resistance in clinical specimens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes a neuraminidase inhibition assay for drug susceptibility monitoring but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond assay detection.

Title: Preliminary crystallographic analysis of neuraminidase N2 from a new influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a major viral respiratory pathogen that causes yearly epidemics in temperate climates. The H3N2 subtype is one of the major causative agents of severe epidemics and plays a critical role in vaccine development. The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are two commercially available NA-targeted competitive antiviral drugs. However, their effectiveness has been compromised by the rapid emergence of resistance. Q136K is a novel mutation in NA which confers resistance to zanamivir. In this study, a Q136K mutant N2 protein was expressed in a baculovirus system and crystals were obtained. The crystal of N2 belonged to space group P2₁2₁2₁, with unit-cell parameters a = 109.5, b = 112.8, c = 165.2 Å. Data were collected to 2.4 Å resolution. Four monomers were found in the asymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient and solvent content were calculated to be 3.0 Å³ Da⁻¹ and 59.0%, respectively.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports crystallographic analysis of neuraminidase protein and a mutation conferring drug resistance but does not explicitly link genotype to phenotypic outcomes like virulence or replication.

Title: Hemagglutinin stalk-based universal vaccine constructs protect against group 2 influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Current influenza virus vaccines contain H1N1 (phylogenetic group 1 hemagglutinin), H3N2 (phylogenetic group 2 hemagglutinin), and influenza B virus components. These vaccines induce good protection against closely matched strains by predominantly eliciting antibodies against the membrane distal globular head domain of their respective viral hemagglutinins. This domain, however, undergoes rapid antigenic drift, allowing the virus to escape neutralizing antibody responses. The membrane proximal stalk domain of the hemagglutinin is much more conserved compared to the head domain. In recent years, a growing collection of antibodies that neutralize a broad range of influenza virus strains and subtypes by binding to this domain has been isolated. Here, we demonstrate that a vaccination strategy based on the stalk domain of the H3 hemagglutinin (group 2) induces in mice broadly neutralizing anti-stalk antibodies that are highly cross-reactive to heterologous H3, H10, H14, H15, and H7 (derived from the novel Chinese H7N9 virus) hemagglutinins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these antibodies confer broad protection against influenza viruses expressing various group 2 hemagglutinins, including an H7 subtype. Through passive transfer experiments, we show that the protection is mediated mainly by neutralizing antibodies against the stalk domain. Our data suggest that, in mice, a vaccine strategy based on the hemagglutinin stalk domain can protect against viruses expressing divergent group 2 hemagglutinins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on vaccine constructs targeting the hemagglutinin stalk domain and antibody-mediated protection, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage of viral variants.

Title: Towards a better understanding of the novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus in China.
Abstract: Recently, a highly dangerous bird flu has infected over 130 patients in China, and the outbreak was attributed to a novel avian-origin H7N9 virus. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of the virus. We clarified the controversial viewpoint on neuraminidase (NA) origin and confirmed it was reassorted from Korean wild birds with higher confidence, whereas common ancestors of pathogenic H7N9 genes existed only one or two years ago. Further analysis of NA sequences suggested that most variations are not drug resistant and current drugs are still effective for the therapy. We also identified a potentially optimal 9-mer epitope, which can be helpful for vaccine development. The interaction of hemagglutinin (HA) and human receptor analog was confirmed by structural modeling, while NA might influence cellular processes through a PDZ-binding motif. A simplified virus infection model was proposed. Taken together, our studies provide a better understanding of the newly reassorted H7N9 viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study provides phylogenetic and structural analyses of the novel H7N9 virus but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits such as virulence or transmissibility.

Title: Epidemiology of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus during 2009-2010 in Taiwan.
Abstract: Outbreak of swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (pdmH1N1) occurred in 2009. Taiwanese authorities implemented nationwide vaccinations with pdmH1N1-specific inactivated vaccine as of November 2009. This study evaluates prevalence, HA phylogenetic relationship, and transmission dynamic of influenza A and B viruses in Taiwan in 2009-2010. Respiratory tract specimens were analyzed for influenza A and B viruses. The pdmH1N1 peaked in November 2009, was predominant from August 2009 to January 2010, then sharply dropped in February 2010. Significant prevalence peaks of influenza B in April-June of 2010 and H3N2 virus in July and August were observed. Highest percentage of pdmH1N1- and H3N2-positive cases appeared among 11-15-year-olds; influenza B-positive cases were dominant among those 6-10 years old. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees showed 11 unique clusters of pdmH1N1, seasonal H3N2 influenza A and B viruses, as well as transmission clusters and mixed infections of influenza strains in Taiwan. The 2009 pdmH1N1 virus was predominant in Taiwan from August 2009 to January 2010; seasonal H3N2 influenza A and B viruses exhibited small prevalence peaks after nationwide vaccinations. Phylogenetic evidence indicated transmission clusters and multiple independent clades of co-circulating influenza A and B strains in Taiwan.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on epidemiology, prevalence, and phylogenetic relationships of influenza strains without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Cyclosporin A inhibits the propagation of influenza virus by interfering with a late event in the virus life cycle.
Abstract: Influenza is a global public health problem that causes a serious respiratory disease. Influenza virus frequently undergoes amino acid substitutions, which result in the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. To control influenza viruses that are resistant to currently available drugs, it is essential to develop new antiviral drugs with a novel molecular target. Here, we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits the propagation of influenza virus in A549 cells by interfering with a late event in the virus life cycle. CsA did not affect adsorption, internalization, viral RNA replication, or synthesis of viral proteins in A549 cells, but inhibited the step(s) after viral protein synthesis, such as assembly or budding. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of the major CsA targets, namely cyclophilin A (CypA), cyclophilin B (CypB), and P-glycoprotein (Pgp), did not inhibit influenza virus propagation. These results suggest that CsA inhibits virus propagation by mechanism(s) independent of the inhibition of the function of CypA, CypB, and Pgp. CsA may target an unknown molecule that works as a positive regulator in the propagation of influenza virus. Our findings would contribute to the development of a novel anti-influenza virus therapy and clarification of the regulatory mechanism of influenza virus multiplication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the antiviral effect of cyclosporin A on influenza virus propagation without explicit analysis of viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Increased transmissibility explains the third wave of infection by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus in England.
Abstract: In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the United Kingdom experienced two waves of infection, the first in the late spring and the second in the autumn. Given the low level of susceptibility to the pandemic virus expected to be remaining in the population after the second wave, it was a surprise that a substantial third epidemic occurred in the UK population between November 2010 and February 2011, despite no evidence for any significant antigenic evolution of the pandemic virus. Here, we use a mathematical model of influenza transmission embedded within a Bayesian synthesis inferential framework to jointly analyze syndromic, virological, and serological surveillance data collected in England in 2009-2011 and thereby assess epidemiological mechanisms which might have generated the third wave. We find that substantially increased transmissibility of the H1N1pdm09 virus is required to reproduce the third wave, suggesting that the virus evolved and increased fitness in the human host by the end of 2010, or that the very cold weather experienced in the United Kingdom at that time enhanced transmission rates. We also find some evidence that the preexisting heterologous immunity which reduced attack rates in adults during 2009 had substantially decayed by the winter of 2010, thus increasing the susceptibility of the adult population to infection. Finally, our analysis suggests that a pandemic vaccination campaign targeting adults and school-age children could have mitigated or prevented the third wave even at moderate levels of coverage.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study of epidemiological data to explain increased transmissibility without direct analysis of viral genotypes or specific genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza risk management: lessons learned from an A(H1N1) pdm09 outbreak investigation in an operational military setting.
Abstract: At the onset of an influenza pandemic, when the severity of a novel strain is still undetermined and there is a threat of introduction into a new environment, e.g., via the deployment of military troops, sensitive screening criteria and conservative isolation practices are generally recommended. In response to elevated rates of influenza-like illness among U.S. military base camps in Kuwait, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 partnered with local U.S. Army medical units to conduct an A(H1N1) pdm09 outbreak investigation. Initial clinical data and nasal specimens were collected via the existent passive surveillance system and active surveillance was conducted using a modified version of the World Health Organization/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness case definition [fever (T > 100.5˚F/38˚C) in addition to cough and/or sore throat in the previous 72 hours] as the screening criteria. Samples were tested via real-time reverse-transcription PCR and sequenced for comparison to global A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses from the same time period. The screening criteria used in Kuwait proved insensitive, capturing only 16% of A(H1N1) pdm09-positive individuals. While still not ideal, using cough as the sole screening criteria would have increased sensitivity to 73%. The results of and lessons learned from this outbreak investigation suggest that pandemic influenza risk management should be a dynamic process (as information becomes available regarding true attack rates and associated mortality, screening and isolation criteria should be re-evaluated and revised as appropriate), and that military operational environments present unique challenges to influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on outbreak investigation, screening criteria, and surveillance of A(H1N1) pdm09 without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A high diversity of Eurasian lineage low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses circulate among wild birds sampled in Egypt.
Abstract: Surveillance for influenza A viruses in wild birds has increased substantially as part of efforts to control the global movement of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Studies conducted in Egypt from 2003 to 2007 to monitor birds for H5N1 identified multiple subtypes of low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses isolated primarily from migratory waterfowl collected in the Nile Delta. Phylogenetic analysis of 28 viral genomes was performed to estimate their nearest ancestors and identify possible reassortants. Migratory flyway patterns were included in the analysis to assess gene flow between overlapping flyways. Overall, the viruses were most closely related to Eurasian, African and/or Central Asian lineage low pathogenicity viruses and belonged to 15 different subtypes. A subset of the internal genes seemed to originate from specific flyways (Black Sea-Mediterranean, East African-West Asian). The remaining genes were derived from a mixture of viruses broadly distributed across as many as 4 different flyways suggesting the importance of the Nile Delta for virus dispersal. Molecular clock date estimates suggested that the time to the nearest common ancestor of all viruses analyzed ranged from 5 to 10 years, indicating frequent genetic exchange with viruses sampled elsewhere. The intersection of multiple migratory bird flyways and the resulting diversity of influenza virus gene lineages in the Nile Delta create conditions favoring reassortment, as evident from the gene constellations identified by this study. In conclusion, we present for the first time a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating in Egypt, underscoring the significance of the region for viral reassortment and the potential emergence of novel avian influenza A viruses, as well as representing a highly diverse influenza A virus gene pool that merits continued monitoring.

Title: High-content analysis of sequential events during the early phase of influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) represents a worldwide threat to public health by causing severe morbidity and mortality every year. Due to high mutation rate, new strains of IAV emerge frequently. These IAVs are often drug-resistant and require vaccine reformulation. A promising approach to circumvent this problem is to target host cell determinants crucial for IAV infection, but dispensable for the cell. Several RNAi-based screens have identified about one thousand cellular factors that promote IAV infection. However, systematic analyses to determine their specific functions are lacking. To address this issue, we developed quantitative, imaging-based assays to dissect seven consecutive steps in the early phases of IAV infection in tissue culture cells. The entry steps for which we developed the assays were: virus binding to the cell membrane, endocytosis, exposure to low pH in endocytic vacuoles, acid-activated fusion of viral envelope with the vacuolar membrane, nucleocapsid uncoating in the cytosol, nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins, and expression of the viral nucleoprotein. We adapted the assays to automated microscopy and optimized them for high-content screening. To quantify the image data, we performed both single and multi-parametric analyses, in combination with machine learning. By time-course experiments, we determined the optimal time points for each assay. Our quality control experiments showed that the assays were sufficiently robust for high-content analysis. The methods we describe in this study provide a powerful high-throughput platform to understand the host cell processes, which can eventually lead to the discovery of novel anti-pathogen strategies.

Title: Geographical distribution of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses of domestic poultry in Vietnam and their genetic relevance with Asian isolates.
Abstract: From the avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks and market surveillances in Vietnam during November 2011 and March 2012, a total of 196 AIV were isolated. Although H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was the most prevalent subtype in Vietnam, 57 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were identified from mainly domestic ducks and some chickens. Of note, various subtypes of LPAI viruses were isolated from domestic ducks in Vietnam: H3 (n = 16), H4 (n = 4), H6 (n = 24), H7 (n = 1), and H9 (n = 10). Geographically, the LPAI viruses were identified in different regions of Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes in LPAIV in Vietnam showed that some H3 (group I) and H4 subtypes AIV clustered with the viruses of several Asian isolates from domestic poultry and wild birds. However, the H6, H9, and some H3 (group II and III) subtypes AIV were closely related to isolates from domestic poultry in Southern China. In addition, whereas the N2 and N6 subtypes AIV belonged to the Eurasian lineage, the N8 subtype AIV was classified to be both of Eurasian and American lineage. These findings revealed that the regional trade and wild birds play a key role transmission of LPAIV in domestic ducks in Vietnam. Further surveillance at the intercountry level is needed to understand the epidemiology of these viruses and to cope with emergence of novel AIV types.

Title: The recent establishment of North American H10 lineage influenza viruses in Australian wild waterfowl and the evolution of Australian avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A H10N7 virus with a hemagglutinin gene of North American origin was detected in Australian chickens and poultry abattoir workers in New South Wales, Australia, in 2010 and in chickens in Queensland, Australia, on a mixed chicken and domestic duck farm in 2012. We investigated their genomic origins by sequencing full and partial genomes of H10 viruses isolated from wild aquatic birds and poultry in Australia and analyzed them with all available avian influenza virus sequences from Oceania and representative viruses from North America and Eurasia. Our analysis showed that the H10N7 viruses isolated from poultry were similar to those that have been circulating since 2009 in Australian aquatic birds and that their initial transmission into Australia occurred during 2007 and 2008. The H10 viruses that appear to have developed endemicity in Australian wild aquatic birds were derived from several viruses circulating in waterfowl along various flyways. Their hemagglutinin gene was derived from aquatic birds in the western states of the United States, whereas the neuraminidase was closely related to that from viruses previously detected in waterfowl in Japan. The remaining genes were derived from Eurasian avian influenza virus lineages. Our analysis of virological data spanning 40 years in Oceania indicates that the long-term evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses in Australia may be determined by climatic changes. The introduction and long-term persistence of avian influenza virus lineages were observed during periods with increased rainfall, whereas bottlenecks and extinction were observed during phases of widespread decreases in rainfall. These results extend our understanding of factors affecting the dynamics of avian influenza and provide important considerations for surveillance and disease control strategies.

Title: Influenza viruses: breaking all the rules.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant pathogens able to repeatedly switch hosts to infect multiple avian and mammalian species, including humans. The unpredictability of IAV evolution and interspecies movement creates continual public health challenges, such as the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus from swine, as well as pandemic threats from the ongoing H5N1 and the recent H7N9 epizootics. In the last decade there has been increased concern about the "dual use" nature of microbiology, and a set of guidelines covering "dual use research of concern" includes seven categories of potentially problematic scientific experiments. In this Perspective, we consider how in nature IAV continually undergo "dual use experiments" as a matter of evolution and selection, and we conclude that studying these properties of IAV is critical for mitigating and preventing future epidemics and pandemics.

Title: Interleukin-6 limits influenza-induced inflammation and protects against fatal lung pathology.
Abstract: Balancing the generation of immune responses capable of controlling virus replication with those causing immunopathology is critical for the survival of the host and resolution of influenza-induced inflammation. Based on the capacity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to govern both optimal T-cell responses and inflammatory resolution, we hypothesised that IL-6 plays an important role in maintaining this balance. Comparison of innate and adaptive immune responses in influenza-infected wild-type control and IL-6-deficient mice revealed striking differences in virus clearance, lung immunopathology and generation of heterosubtypic immunity. Mice lacking IL-6 displayed a profound defect in their ability to mount an anti-viral T-cell response. Failure to adequately control virus was further associated with an enhanced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the lung and an elevated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-α and TNF-α. These events were associated with severe lung damage, characterised by profound vascular leakage and death. Our data highlight an essential role for IL-6 in orchestrating anti-viral immunity through an ability to limit inflammation, promote protective adaptive immune responses and prevent fatal immunopathology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of IL-6 in immune response and pathology during influenza infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multi-target parallel processing approach for gene-to-structure determination of the influenza polymerase PB2 subunit.
Abstract: Pandemic outbreaks of highly virulent influenza strains can cause widespread morbidity and mortality in human populations worldwide. In the United States alone, an average of 41,400 deaths and 1.86 million hospitalizations are caused by influenza virus infection each year (1). Point mutations in the polymerase basic protein 2 subunit (PB2) have been linked to the adaptation of the viral infection in humans (2). Findings from such studies have revealed the biological significance of PB2 as a virulence factor, thus highlighting its potential as an antiviral drug target. The structural genomics program put forth by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) provides funding to Emerald Bio and three other Pacific Northwest institutions that together make up the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID). The SSGCID is dedicated to providing the scientific community with three-dimensional protein structures of NIAID category A-C pathogens. Making such structural information available to the scientific community serves to accelerate structure-based drug design. Structure-based drug design plays an important role in drug development. Pursuing multiple targets in parallel greatly increases the chance of success for new lead discovery by targeting a pathway or an entire protein family. Emerald Bio has developed a high-throughput, multi-target parallel processing pipeline (MTPP) for gene-to-structure determination to support the consortium. Here we describe the protocols used to determine the structure of the PB2 subunit from four different influenza A strains.

Title: Characterization of the upper respiratory tract microbiomes of patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza.
Abstract: The upper respiratory tract microbiome has an important role in respiratory health. Influenza A is a common viral infection that challenges that health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia. Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics. We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60 universal target amplification and sequencing. Profiles were examined at the phylum and nearest neighbor "species" levels using the characteristics of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences. At the nearest neighbor "species" level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 "species" and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age. Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota. A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables. To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study. A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute bacterial quantification was observed. This study represents the first examination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome using a target other than the 16S rRNA gene and to our knowledge, the first thorough examination of this microbiome during a viral infection.

Title: H7N9 avian influenza A virus and the perpetual challenge of potential human pandemicity.
Abstract: ABSTRACT The ongoing H7N9 influenza epizootic in China once again presents us questions about the origin of pandemics and how to recognize them in early stages of development. Over the past ~135 years, H7 influenza viruses have neither caused pandemics nor been recognized as having undergone human adaptation. Yet several unusual properties of these viruses, including their poultry epizootic potential, mammalian adaptation, and atypical clinical syndromes in rarely infected humans, suggest that they may be different from other avian influenza viruses, thus questioning any assurance that the likelihood of human adaptation is low. At the same time, the H7N9 epizootic provides an opportunity to learn more about the mammalian/human adaptational capabilities of avian influenza viruses and challenges us to integrate virologic and public health research and surveillance at the animal-human interface.

Title: Detection of genetic markers related to high pathogenicity in influenza by SERS.
Abstract: We have developed a method for the detection of genetic markers associated with high pathogenicity in influenza. The assay consists of an array of 5'-thiolated ssDNA oligonucleotides immobilized on the surface of a Ag nanorod substrate that serve as capture probes for the detection of synthetic RNA sequences coding for a genetic mutation in the influenza PB1-F2 protein. Hybridization of the DNA probes to their complementary RNA sequences was detected using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Multivariate statistical analysis was used to differentiate the spectra of the complementary DNA probe-RNA target hybrids from those of the non-complementary DNA probes containing a single base pair polymorphism. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was able to distinguish with 100% accuracy the spectra of the complementary DNA probe-RNA target from the spectra of the immobilized DNA probes alone, or the DNA probes incubated with non-complementary RNA sequences. Linearity of response and limits of sensitivity of the SERS-based assays were determined using a partial least squares (PLS) regression model; detection limits computed by PLS was determined to be ~10 nM. The binding affinity of the DNA probes to their complementary RNA sequences was confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, the detection limits observed using ELISA were approximately 10× higher (~100 nM) than those determined by PLS analysis of the SERS spectra.
Relevant: False

Title: Linezolid decreases susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia postinfluenza infection in mice through its effects on IFN-γ.
Abstract: Influenza infection predisposes patients to secondary bacterial pneumonia that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Although this association is well documented, the mechanisms that govern this synergism are poorly understood. A window of hyporesponsiveness following influenza infection has been associated with a substantial increase in local and systemic IFN-γ concentrations. Recent data suggest that the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid decreases IFN-γ and TNF-α production in vitro from stimulated PBMCs. We therefore sought to determine whether linezolid would reverse immune hyporesponsiveness after influenza infection in mice through its effects on IFN-γ. In vivo dose-response studies demonstrated that oral linezolid administration sufficiently decreased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of IFN-γ at day 7 postinfluenza infection in a dose-dependent manner. The drug also decreased morbidity as measured by weight loss compared with vehicle-treated controls. When mice were challenged intranasally with Streptococcus pneumoniae 7 d postinfection with influenza, linezolid pretreatment led to decreased IFN-γ and TNF-α production, decreased weight loss, and lower bacterial burdens at 24 h postbacterial infection in comparison with vehicle-treated controls. To determine whether these effects were due to suppression of IFN-γ, linezolid-treated animals were given intranasal instillations of rIFN-γ before challenge with S. pneumoniae. This partially reversed the protective effects observed in the linezolid-treated mice, suggesting that the modulatory effects of linezolid are mediated partially by its ability to blunt IFN-γ production. These results suggest that IFN-γ, and potentially TNF-α, may be useful drug targets for prophylaxis against secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection.

Title: Influenza virus A(H3N2) strain isolated from cerebrospinal fluid from a patient presenting myelopathy post infectious.
Abstract: Neurological involvement during influenza infection has been described during epidemics and is often consistent with serious sequelae or death. To investigate the etiologic agent involved in myelopathy post influenza-like syndrome. This investigation focuses on virus isolation from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from a 19-year-old male student presenting with clinical diagnosis of myelopathy post influenza-like syndrome. To achieve this goal, different cell cultures and molecular methodologies were carried out. Influenza virus A(H3N2) strain was isolated in MDCK cell culture; virus particles were observed under electron microscopy. Phylogenetics analyses showed that the Brazilian influenza A(H3N2) strains were closely related to the A/Perth/16/2009-like. This study demonstrates that influenza virus A(H3N2) strain was the cause of illness of the students. According to the Brazilian influenza virus sentinel surveillance data A/Perth/16/2009-LIKE (H3N2) strain has predominated during the 2010 influenza virus season in Brasília-DF.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis of an H3N2 strain from CSF but does not explicitly link viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: Viral evolution from one generation of human influenza infection to the next.
Abstract: 1. In a sub-tropical epidemic, most of the apparent household secondary cases are actually secondary infections. 2. The consensus sequence for the entire influenza virus genome is not usually identical within the same household sample. Rather, there are commonly one or two nucleotide changes. 3. These results hint at an obvious generational threshold for adaptation at the level of the consensus sequence.
Relevant: False

Title: Biogenesis, assembly, and export of viral messenger ribonucleoproteins in the influenza A virus infected cell.
Abstract: The flow of genetic information from sites of transcription within the nucleus to the cytoplasmic translational machinery of eukaryotic cells is obstructed by a physical blockade, the nuclear double membrane, which must be overcome in order to adhere to the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA makes RNA makes protein. Advancement in the field of cellular and molecular biology has painted a detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms from transcription of genes to mRNAs and their processing that is closely coupled to export from the nucleus. The rules that govern delivering messenger transcripts from the nucleus must be obeyed by influenza A virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae that has adopted a nuclear replication cycle. The negative-sense genome of influenza A virus is segmented into eight individual viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes containing the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and single-stranded RNA encapsidated in viral nucleoprotein. Influenza A virus mRNAs fall into three major categories, intronless, intron-containing unspliced and spliced. During evolutionary history, influenza A virus has conceived a way of negotiating the passage of viral transcripts from the nucleus to cytoplasmic sites of protein synthesis. The major mRNA nuclear export NXF1 pathway is increasingly implicated in viral mRNA export and this review considers and discusses the current understanding of how influenza A virus exploits the host mRNA export pathway for replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of viral mRNA biogenesis and export mechanisms without explicit links between viral genotype and phenotype.

Title: Identification of Host Kinase Genes Required for Influenza Virus Replication and the Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs.
Abstract: Human protein kinases (HPKs) have profound effects on cellular responses. To better understand the role of HPKs and the signaling networks that influence influenza virus replication, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of 720 HPKs was performed. From the screen, 17 HPKs (NPR2, MAP3K1, DYRK3, EPHA6, TPK1, PDK2, EXOSC10, NEK8, PLK4, SGK3, NEK3, PANK4, ITPKB, CDC2L5 (CDK13), CALM2, PKN3, and HK2) were validated as essential for A/WSN/33 influenza virus replication, and 6 HPKs (CDK13, HK2, NEK8, PANK4, PLK4 and SGK3) were identified as vital for both A/WSN/33 and A/New Caledonia/20/99 influenza virus replication. These HPKs were found to affect multiple host pathways and regulated by miRNAs induced during infection. Using a panel of miRNA agonists and antagonists, miR-149* was found to regulate NEK8 expression, miR-548d-3p was found to regulate MAPK1 transcript expression, and miRs -1228 and -138 to regulate CDK13 expression. Up-regulation of miR-34c induced PLK4 transcript and protein expression and enhanced influenza virus replication, while miR-34c inhibition reduced viral replication. These findings identify HPKs important for influenza viral replication and show the miRNAs that govern their expression.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host kinase genes and miRNAs affecting influenza replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antiviral activity of Jinchai capsule against influenza virus.
Abstract: To evaluate the effect on influenza virus of Jinchai, a capsule made of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with the FM1 strain of influenza virus A (subtype H1N1) in vitro. They were used to explore how Jinchai affected cell adsorption, cell membrane fusion, transcription and replication of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, intracellular pH, and influenza virus protein acid (PA) polymerase subunit were detected with confocal microscopy and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Jinchai significantly reduced the expression of HA and PA polymerase subunit mRNA in infected MDCK cells. Jinchai also significantly decreased intracellular pH in infected cells. Jinchai had strong anti-influenza activity against the influenza virus. It weakened the ability of the influenza virus to adsorb to cell wall and fuse with cell membranes in the early infection stage, and inhibited the transcription and replication of the virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral activity of a traditional medicine on influenza virus infection but does not explicitly link viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: [Phylogenetic analysis and genotyping of A/H3N2 Influenza viruses isolated from patients hospitalised with influenza-like illness symptoms in the na bulovce hospital in the season 2011/2012].
Abstract: Influenza A virus is an important cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Clinical manifestations of ARI vary from mild or moderate to life-threatening conditions requiring intensive care. Given the segmented genome, a large natural reservoir of other influenza virus subtypes, and antibody selection pressure in the population, the virus is variable and genetically unstable. The phylogenetic analysis and genotyping of A/H3N2 influenza viruses isolated from patients hospitalised with influenza-like illness symptoms in the Na Bulovce Hospital in the season 2011/2012 support the assumption that the pathogenicity is a polygenic trait modifiable by the host health status and seems not to be unambiguously associated with any specific mutations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study performs phylogenetic analysis and genotyping but concludes that pathogenicity is a polygenic trait not unambiguously associated with specific mutations, thus no explicit genotype-phenotype link.

Title: A global model of avian influenza prediction in wild birds: the importance of northern regions.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is enzootic to wild birds, which are its natural reservoir. The virus exhibits a large degree of genetic diversity and most of the isolated strains are of low pathogenicity to poultry. Although AIV is nearly ubiquitous in wild bird populations, highly pathogenic H5N1 subtypes in poultry have been the focus of most modeling efforts. To better understand viral ecology of AIV, a predictive model should 1) include wild birds, 2) include all isolated subtypes, and 3) cover the host's natural range, unbounded by artificial country borders. As of this writing, there are few large-scale predictive models of AIV in wild birds. We used the Random Forests algorithm, an ensemble data-mining machine-learning method, to develop a global-scale predictive map of AIV, identify important predictors, and describe the environmental niche of AIV in wild bird populations. The model has an accuracy of 0.79 and identified northern areas as having the highest relative predicted risk of outbreak. The primary niche was described as regions of low annual rainfall and low temperatures. This study is the first global-scale model of low-pathogenicity avian influenza in wild birds and underscores the importance of largely unstudied northern regions in the persistence of AIV.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a predictive ecological model of avian influenza occurrence in wild birds based on environmental factors, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza activity--United States, 2012-13 season and composition of the 2013-14 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2012-13 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity* increased through November and December before peaking in late December. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated overall, but influenza B viruses and, to a lesser extent, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) viruses also were reported in the United States. This influenza season was moderately severe, with a higher percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), higher rates of hospitalization, and more reported deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza compared with recent years. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2012-13 influenza season (September 30, 2012-May 18, 2013) as of June 7, 2013, and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2013-14 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: Evolution of a reassortant North American gull influenza virus lineage: drift, shift and stability.
Abstract: The role of gulls in the ecology of avian influenza (AI) is different than that of waterfowl. Different constellations of subtypes circulate within the two groups of birds and AI viruses isolated from North American gulls frequently possess reassortant genomes with genetic elements from both North America and Eurasian lineages. A 2008 isolate from a Newfoundland Great Black-backed Gull contained a mix of North American waterfowl, North American gull and Eurasian lineage genes. We isolated, sequenced and phylogenetically compared avian influenza viruses from 2009 Canadian wild birds. We analyzed six 2009 virus isolates from Canada and found the same phylogenetic lineage had persisted over a larger geographic area, with an expanded host range that included dabbling and diving ducks as well as gulls. All of the 2009 virus isolates contained an internal protein coding set of genes of the same Eurasian lineage genes except PB1 that was from a North American lineage, and these genes continued to evolve by genetic drift. We show evidence that the 2008 Great Black-backed Gull virus was derived from this lineage with a reassortment of a North American PA gene into the more stable core set of internal protein coding genes that has circulated in avian populations for at least 2 years. From this core, the surface glycoprotein genes have switched several times creating H13N6, H13N2, and H16N3 subtypes. These gene segments were from North American lineages except for the H16 and N3 vRNAs. This process appears similar to genetic shifts seen with swine influenza where a stable "triple reassortant internal gene" core has circulated in swine populations with genetic shifts occurring with hemaggluttinin and neuraminidase proteins getting periodically switched. Thus gulls may serve as genetic mixing vessels for different lineages of avian influenza, similar to the role of swine with regards to human influenza. These findings illustrate the need for continued surveillance in gull and waterfowl populations, both on the Pacific and especially Atlantic coasts of North America, to document virus intercontinental movement and the role of gull species in the evolution and epidemiology of AI.

Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and genetic reassortment of influenza viruses in gulls and waterfowl, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Is low pathogenic avian influenza virus virulent for wild waterbirds?
Abstract: Although low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is traditionally considered to have adapted to its wild waterbird host to become avirulent, recent studies have suggested that LPAIV infection might after all have clinical effects. Therefore, I reviewed the literature on LPAIV infections in wild waterbirds. The virulence of LPAIV was assessed in 17 studies on experimental infections and nine studies on natural infections. Reported evidence for virulence were reductions in return rate, feeding rate, body weight, long-range movement and reproductive success, as well as pathological changes in infected organs. However, major caveats in studies of experimental infections were unnatural route of LPAIV inoculation, animal husbandry not simulating natural stressors and low sensitivity of clinical assessment. Major caveats in studies of natural infections were incomplete measurement of LPAIV infection burden, quasi-experimental design and potential misclassification of birds. After taking these caveats into account, the only remaining evidence for virulence was that presence and intensity of LPAIV infection were negatively correlated with body weight. Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews virulence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus in wild waterbirds but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The emergence and diversification of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses.
Abstract: The Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus was first detected in the goose population of Guangdong, China in 1996. The viruses in this lineage are unique in their ecological success, demonstrating an extremely broad host range and becoming established in poultry over much of Asia and in Africa. H5N1 viruses have also diverged into multiple clades and subclades that generally do not cross neutralize, which has greatly confounded control measures in poultry and pre-pandemic vaccine strain selection. Although H5N1 viruses currently cannot transmit efficiently between mammals they exhibit high mortality in humans and recent experimental studies have shown that it is possible to generate an H5N1 virus that is transmissible in mammals. In addition to causing unprecedented economic losses, the long-term presence of the H5N1 virus in poultry and its frequent introductions to humans continue to pose a significant pandemic threat. Here we provide a summary of the genesis, molecular epidemiology and evolution of this H5N1 lineage, particularly the factors that have contributed to the continued diversification and ecological success of H5N1 viruses, with particular reference to the poultry production systems they have emerged from.

Title: The autoimmune basis of narcolepsy.
Abstract: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagonic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed nocturnal sleep patterns. Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin (orexin)-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Evidence, such as a strong association with HLA DQB1*06:02, strongly suggests an autoimmune basis targeting hypocretin neurons. Genome-wide association studies have strengthened the association between narcolepsy and immune system gene polymorphisms, including the identification of polymorphisms in the T cell receptor alpha locus, TNFSF4 (also called OX40L), Cathepsin H (CTSH) the purinergic receptor P2RY11, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Recently, attention has been raised regarding a spike in cases of childhood narcolepsy in 2010 following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) in China and vaccination with Pandemrix, an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine that was used in Europe. How the immune system may be involved in disease initiation and/or progression remains a challenge to researchers. Potential immunological pathways that could lead to the specific elimination of hypocretin producing neurons include molecular mimicry or bystander activation, and are likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as upper airway infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses autoimmune basis of narcolepsy and possible links to H1N1 infection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Frequency and patterns of reassortment in natural influenza A virus infection in a reservoir host.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) can dramatically alter both genotype and phenotype at a rapid rate as a product of co-infection and reassortment. Avian IAV exhibit high levels of phylogenetic incongruence, suggesting high levels of reassortment in the virus reservoir. Using a natural-experimental system, we reconstructed relationships amongst 92 viruses across 15 subtypes from 10 Mallards in an autumn season. Phylogenetic analyses estimated that 56% of the isolated viruses were reassorted. Network analysis demonstrated different patterns of reassortment and limited exchange of segments between primary and secondary infections. No clear patterns of linkage between segments were found, and patterns within a season were likely the consequence of continued introduction of new constellations, high viral load and diversity in the wild bird reservoir, and co-infections. This is the first IAV study to implement multiple tools available for elucidating factors governing reassortment patterns in naturally infected Mallards.

Title: A plant extract of Ribes nigrum folium possesses anti-influenza virus activity in vitro and in vivo by preventing virus entry to host cells.
Abstract: Infections with influenza A viruses (IAV) are still amongst the major causes of highly contagious severe respiratory diseases not only bearing a devastating effect to human health, but also significantly impact the economy. Besides vaccination that represents the best option to protect from IAV infections, only two classes of anti-influenza drugs, inhibitors of the M2 ion channel and the neuraminidase, often causing resistant IAV variants have been approved. That is why the need for effective and amply available antivirals against IAV is of high priority. Here we introduce LADANIA067 from the leaves of the wild black currant (Ribes nigrum folium) as a potent compound against IAV infections in vitro and in vivo. LADANIA067 treatment resulted in a reduction of progeny virus titers in cell cultures infected with prototype avian and human influenza virus strains of different subtypes. At the effective dose of 100 µg/ml the extract did not exhibit apparent harming effects on cell viability, metabolism or proliferation. Further, viruses showed no tendency to develop resistance to LADANIA067 when compared to amantadine that resulted in the generation of resistant variants after only a few passages. On a molecular basis the protective effect of LADANIA067 appears to be mainly due to interference with virus internalisation. In the mouse infection model LADANIA067 treatment reduces progeny virus titers in the lung upon intranasal application. In conclusion, an extract from the leaves of the wild black currant might be a promising source for the development of new antiviral compounds to fight IAV infections.

Title: Harnessing alveolar macrophages for sustained mucosal T-cell recall confers long-term protection to mice against lethal influenza challenge without clinical disease.
Abstract: Vaccines that induce T cells, which recognize conserved viral proteins, could confer universal protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. An effective vaccine should generate sufficient mucosal T cells to ensure rapid viral control before clinical disease. However, T cells may also cause lung injury in influenza, so this approach carries inherent risks. Here we describe intranasal immunization of mice with a lentiviral vector expressing influenza nucleoprotein (NP), together with an NFκB activator, which transduces over 75% of alveolar macrophages (AM). This strategy recalls and expands NP-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung and airway of mice that have been immunized subcutaneously, or previously exposed to influenza. Granzyme B-high, lung-resident T-cell populations persist for at least 4 months and can control a lethal influenza challenge without harmful cytokine responses, weight loss, or lung injury. These data demonstrate that AM can be harnessed as effective antigen-presenting cells for influenza vaccination.

Title: Colocalization of different influenza viral RNA segments in the cytoplasm before viral budding as shown by single-molecule sensitivity FISH analysis.
Abstract: The Influenza A virus genome consists of eight negative sense, single-stranded RNA segments. Although it has been established that most virus particles contain a single copy of each of the eight viral RNAs, the packaging selection mechanism remains poorly understood. Influenza viral RNAs are synthesized in the nucleus, exported into the cytoplasm and travel to the plasma membrane where viral budding and genome packaging occurs. Due to the difficulties in analyzing associated vRNPs while preserving information about their positions within the cell, it has remained unclear how and where during cellular trafficking the viral RNAs of different segments encounter each other. Using a multicolor single-molecule sensitivity fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach, we have quantitatively monitored the colocalization of pairs of influenza viral RNAs in infected cells. We found that upon infection, the viral RNAs from the incoming particles travel together until they reach the nucleus. The viral RNAs were then detected in distinct locations in the nucleus; they are then exported individually and initially remain separated in the cytoplasm. At later time points, the different viral RNA segments gather together in the cytoplasm in a microtubule independent manner. Viral RNAs of different identities colocalize at a high frequency when they are associated with Rab11 positive vesicles, suggesting that Rab11 positive organelles may facilitate the association of different viral RNAs. Using engineered influenza viruses lacking the expression of HA or M2 protein, we showed that these viral proteins are not essential for the colocalization of two different viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. In sum, our smFISH results reveal that the viral RNAs travel together in the cytoplasm before their arrival at the plasma membrane budding sites. This newly characterized step of the genome packaging process demonstrates the precise spatiotemporal regulation of the infection cycle.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates intracellular colocalization of viral RNA segments but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular detection of human H7N9 influenza A virus causing outbreaks in China.
Abstract: A novel subtype of influenza A virus (H7N9) was recently identified in humans. The virus is a reassortant of avian viruses, but these human isolates contain mutations [hemagglutinin (HA) Q226L and PB2 E627K] that might make it easier for the virus to adapt to mammalian hosts. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed. We developed a 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assay to detect the novel human H7N9 virus. The primer set was specific to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the H7N9 viruses currently causing the outbreak in China and had mismatches to all previously known avian or mammalian H7 HA sequences. In addition, the assay was evaluated using influenza A viruses of various genetic backgrounds and other negative controls. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 0.04 TCID50 (median tissue culture infective dose) per reaction. The assay specificity was high and all negative control samples, including 8 H7 viruses not closely related to the human H7N9 virus, tested negative. The established assay allows rapid detection of the novel human H7N9 virus, thereby allowing better pandemic preparedness.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops a molecular detection assay for H7N9 virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A perspective on multiple waves of influenza pandemics.
Abstract: A striking characteristic of the past four influenza pandemic outbreaks in the United States has been the multiple waves of infections. However, the mechanisms responsible for the multiple waves of influenza or other acute infectious diseases are uncertain. Understanding these mechanisms could provide knowledge for health authorities to develop and implement prevention and control strategies. We exhibit five distinct mechanisms, each of which can generate two waves of infections for an acute infectious disease. The first two mechanisms capture changes in virus transmissibility and behavioral changes. The third mechanism involves population heterogeneity (e.g., demography, geography), where each wave spreads through one sub-population. The fourth mechanism is virus mutation which causes delayed susceptibility of individuals. The fifth mechanism is waning immunity. Each mechanism is incorporated into separate mathematical models, and outbreaks are then simulated. We use the models to examine the effects of the initial number of infected individuals (e.g., border control at the beginning of the outbreak) and the timing of and amount of available vaccinations. Four models, individually or in any combination, reproduce the two waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States, both qualitatively and quantitatively. One model reproduces the two waves only qualitatively. All models indicate that significantly reducing or delaying the initial numbers of infected individuals would have little impact on the attack rate. Instead, this reduction or delay results in a single wave as opposed to two waves. Furthermore, four of these models also indicate that a vaccination program started earlier than October 2009 (when the H1N1 vaccine was initially distributed) could have eliminated the second wave of infection, while more vaccine available starting in October would not have eliminated the second wave.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study of influenza pandemic waves focusing on epidemiological mechanisms rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Towards multiscale modeling of influenza infection.
Abstract: Aided by recent advances in computational power, algorithms, and higher fidelity data, increasingly detailed theoretical models of infection with influenza A virus are being developed. We review single scale models as they describe influenza infection from intracellular to global scales, and, in particular, we consider those models that capture details specific to influenza and can be used to link different scales. We discuss the few multiscale models of influenza infection that have been developed in this emerging field. In addition to discussing modeling approaches, we also survey biological data on influenza infection and transmission that is relevant for constructing influenza infection models. We envision that, in the future, multiscale models that capitalize on technical advances in experimental biology and high performance computing could be used to describe the large spatial scale epidemiology of influenza infection, evolution of the virus, and transmission between hosts more accurately.

Title: Molecular assays for quantitative and qualitative detection of influenza virus and oseltamivir resistance mutations.
Abstract: Sensitive and reproducible molecular assays are essential for influenza virus diagnostics. This manuscript describes the design, validation, and evaluation of a set of real-time RT-PCR assays for quantification and subtyping of human influenza viruses from patient respiratory material. Four assays are included for detection of oseltamivir resistance mutations H275Y in prepandemic and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and E119V and R292K in influenza A/H3N2 neuraminidase. The lower limits of detection of the quantification assay were determined to be 1.7 log(10) virus particles per milliliter (vp/mL) for influenza A and 2.2 log(10) vp/mL for influenza B virus. The lower limits of quantification were 2.1 and 2.3 log(10) vp/mL, respectively. The RT-PCR efficiencies and lower limits of detection of the quantification assays were only marginally affected when tested on the most dissimilar target sequences found in the GenBank database. Finally, the resistance RT-PCR assays detected at least 5% mutant viruses present in mixtures containing both wild-type and mutant viruses with approximated limits of detection of 2.4 log(10) vp/mL. Overall, this set of RT-PCR assays is a powerful tool for enhanced influenza virus surveillance.

Title: Nox1 oxidase suppresses influenza a virus-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection is an ongoing clinical problem and thus, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms that regulate the lung inflammation in order to unravel novel generic pharmacological strategies. Evidence indicates that the Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase enzyme promotes influenza A virus-induced lung oxidative stress, inflammation and dysfunction via ROS generation. In addition, lung epithelial and endothelial cells express the Nox1 isoform of NADPH oxidase, placing this enzyme at key sites to regulate influenza A virus-induced lung inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Nox1 oxidase regulates the inflammatory response and the oxidative stress to influenza infection in vivo in mice. Male WT and Nox1-deficient (Nox1(-/y)) mice were infected with the moderately pathogenic HkX-31 (H3N2, 1×10(4) PFU) influenza A virus for analysis of bodyweight, airways inflammation, oxidative stress, viral titre, lung histopathology, and cytokine/chemokine expression at 3 and 7 days post infection. HkX-31 virus infection of Nox1(-/y) mice resulted in significantly greater: loss of bodyweight (Day 3); BALF neutrophilia, peri-bronchial, peri-vascular and alveolar inflammation; Nox2-dependent inflammatory cell ROS production and peri-bronchial, epithelial and endothelial oxidative stress. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, GM-CSF and TNF-α was higher in Nox1(-/y) lungs compared to WT mice at Day 3, however, the expression of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, IFN-γ and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were lower in lungs of Nox1(-/y) mice vs. WT mice at Day 7. Lung viral titre, and airways infiltration of active CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and of Tregs were similar between WT and Nox1(-/y) mice. In conclusion, Nox1 oxidase suppresses influenza A virus induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in mice particularly at the early phases of the infection. Nox1 and Nox2 oxidases appear to have opposing roles in the regulation of inflammation caused by influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host factors (Nox1 oxidase) regulating lung inflammation and oxidative stress during influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Plasminogen controls inflammation and pathogenesis of influenza virus infections via fibrinolysis.
Abstract: Detrimental inflammation of the lungs is a hallmark of severe influenza virus infections. Endothelial cells are the source of cytokine amplification, although mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. Here, using combined pharmacological and gene-deletion approaches, we show that plasminogen controls lung inflammation and pathogenesis of infections with influenza A/PR/8/34, highly pathogenic H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Reduction of virus replication was not responsible for the observed effect. However, pharmacological depletion of fibrinogen, the main target of plasminogen reversed disease resistance of plasminogen-deficient mice or mice treated with an inhibitor of plasminogen-mediated fibrinolysis. Therefore, plasminogen contributes to the deleterious inflammation of the lungs and local fibrin clot formation may be implicated in host defense against influenza virus infections. Our studies suggest that the hemostatic system might be explored for novel treatments against influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host plasminogen's role in inflammation and pathogenesis during influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Tools to detect influenza virus.
Abstract: In 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1 09) started to spread quickly in many countries. It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of diagnostic tools for influenza virus detection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The role of polymorphisms in host immune genes in determining the severity of respiratory illness caused by pandemic H1N1 influenza.
Abstract: Following the influenza epidemics, it has become clear that severity of illness is not uniform. Comorbidities and immunocompromise account for only a fraction of severe cases and do not explain the differential severity among the otherwise healthy during pandemics. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a focus has been placed on better understanding of the determinants and pathogenesis of severe influenza infections. Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly within the H1N1 pandemic). The improved understanding of the cellular mechanisms and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of severe disease along with technological advances have allowed a more systematic approach to the exploration of the host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severe respiratory illness. By better defining the role of genetic variability in the immune responses to influenza, and identifying key polymorphisms that either protect against severe manifestation or those that impair the host immune response, it is possible to envision better methods to identify at-risk populations and new targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines. This review will summarize the accumulated literature examining the immunogenetic factors associated with propensity for the development of severe pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) manifestations. We will focus on novel and key insights gained through study of ethnic populations that appeared more vulnerable to severe disease during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The review focuses on host immune gene polymorphisms affecting severity of influenza illness, emphasizing host genetics rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Tyrosine 132 phosphorylation of influenza A virus M1 protein is crucial for virus replication by controlling the nuclear import of M1.
Abstract: Phosphorylation of viral proteins plays important roles in the influenza A virus (IAV) life cycle. By using mass spectrometry, we identified tyrosine 132 (Y132) as a phosphorylation site of the matrix protein (M1) of the influenza virus A/WSN/1933(H1N1). Phosphorylation at this site is essential to the process of virus replication by controlling the nuclear import of M1. We further demonstrated that the phosphorylated tyrosine is crucial for the binding of M1 to the nuclear import factor importin-α1, since any substitutions at this site severely reduce this protein-protein interaction and damage the importin-α1-mediated nuclear import of M1. Additionally, the tyrosine phosphorylation which leads to the nuclear import of M1 is blocked by a Janus kinase inhibitor. The present study reveals a pivotal role of this tyrosine phosphorylation in the intracellular transportation of M1, which controls the process of viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phosphorylation of a specific viral protein (M1) and its role in virus replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes (e.g., sequence variants) to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus surveillance in wild birds in Georgia: 2009-2011.
Abstract: The Caucasus, at the border of Europe and Asia, is important for migration and over-wintering of wild waterbirds. Three flyways, the Central Asian, East Africa-West Asia, and Mediterranean/Black Sea flyways, converge in the Caucasus region. Thus, the Caucasus region might act as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in the post-breeding, migrating and overwintering periods. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, using five sample areas geographically spread throughout suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh feces samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 orders of birds, of which 84 were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1.6%. We observed peak prevalence in large gulls during the autumn migration (5.3-9.8%), but peak prevalence in Black-headed Gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed increased AIV prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregations and migration stop-over period (6.3%) but at lower levels to those observed in other more northerly post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the overwintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of a breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive on arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and virologically negative for AIV throughout their time on the breeding grounds, in contrast to gull AIV data from other geographic regions. We show that close phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia are sourced from a wide geographic area throughout Western and Central Eurasia, and from areas that are represented by multiple different flyways, likely linking different host sub-populations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes surveillance and phylogenetic relationships of avian influenza viruses in wild birds but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Glycomic analysis of human respiratory tract tissues and correlation with influenza virus infection.
Abstract: The first step in influenza infection of the human respiratory tract is binding of the virus to sialic (Sia) acid terminated receptors. The binding of different strains of virus for the receptor is determined by the α linkage of the sialic acid to galactose and the adjacent glycan structure. In this study the N- and O-glycan composition of the human lung, bronchus and nasopharynx was characterized by mass spectrometry. Analysis showed that there was a wide spectrum of both Sia α2-3 and α2-6 glycans in the lung and bronchus. This glycan structural data was then utilized in combination with binding data from 4 of the published glycan arrays to assess whether these current glycan arrays were able to predict replication of human, avian and swine viruses in human ex vivo respiratory tract tissues. The most comprehensive array from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics contained the greatest diversity of sialylated glycans, but was not predictive of productive replication in the bronchus and lung. Our findings indicate that more comprehensive but focused arrays need to be developed to investigate influenza virus binding in an assessment of newly emerging influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes glycan structures in human respiratory tissues and correlates with influenza virus binding, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Structure and assembly of the influenza A virus ribonucleoprotein complex.
Abstract: The genome of influenza A viruses consists of eight segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA that are encapsidated as individual rod-shaped ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). Each RNP contains a viral RNA, a viral polymerase and multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Influenza A virus RNPs play important roles during virus infection by directing viral RNA replication and transcription, intracellular transport of the viral RNA, gene reassortment as well as viral genome packaging into progeny particles. As a unique genomic entity, the influenza A virus RNP has been extensively studied since the 1960s. Recently, exciting progress has been made in studying the RNP structure and its assembly, leading to a better understanding of the structural basis of various RNP functions.
Relevant: False

Title: The lipid mediator protectin D1 inhibits influenza virus replication and improves severe influenza.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are a major cause of mortality. Given the potential for future lethal pandemics, effective drugs are needed for the treatment of severe influenza such as that caused by H5N1 viruses. Using mediator lipidomics and bioactive lipid screen, we report that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediator protectin D1 (PD1) markedly attenuated influenza virus replication via RNA export machinery. Production of PD1 was suppressed during severe influenza and PD1 levels inversely correlated with the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses. Suppression of PD1 was genetically mapped to 12/15-lipoxygenase activity. Importantly, PD1 treatment improved the survival and pathology of severe influenza in mice, even under conditions where known antiviral drugs fail to protect from death. These results identify the endogenous lipid mediator PD1 as an innate suppressor of influenza virus replication that protects against lethal influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a lipid mediator that inhibits influenza virus replication but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antigen-specific memory regulatory CD4+Foxp3+ T cells control memory responses to influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Regulatory CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells (Tregs) are key regulators of inflammatory responses and control the magnitude of cellular immune responses to viral infections. However, little is known about how Tregs contribute to immune regulation during memory responses to previously encountered pathogens. In this study, we used MHC class II tetramers specific for the 311-325 peptide from influenza nucleoprotein (NP311-325/IA(b)) to track the Ag-specific Treg response to primary and secondary influenza virus infections. During secondary infections, Ag-specific memory Tregs showed accelerated accumulation in the lung-draining lymph node and lung parenchyma relative to a primary infection. Memory Tregs effectively controlled the in vitro proliferation of memory CD8(+) cells in an Ag-specific fashion that was MHC class II dependent. When memory Tregs were depleted before secondary infection, the magnitude of the Ag-specific memory CD8(+) T cell response was increased, as was pulmonary inflammation and airway cytokine/chemokine expression. Replacement of memory Tregs with naive Tregs failed to restore the regulation of the memory CD8 T cell response during secondary infection. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed population of Ag-specific memory Tregs that shape the cellular immune response to secondary influenza virus challenges and offer an additional parameter to consider when determining the efficacy of vaccinations.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on immune regulatory T cells controlling memory responses to influenza infection, no explicit link between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Structure-based discovery of the novel antiviral properties of naproxen against the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus.
Abstract: The nucleoprotein (NP) binds the viral RNA genome and associates with the polymerase in a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) required for transcription and replication of influenza A virus. NP has no cellular counterpart, and the NP sequence is highly conserved, which led to considering NP a hot target in the search for antivirals. We report here that monomeric nucleoprotein can be inhibited by a small molecule binding in its RNA binding groove, resulting in a novel antiviral against influenza A virus. We identified naproxen, an anti-inflammatory drug that targeted the nucleoprotein to inhibit NP-RNA association required for NP function, by virtual screening. Further docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified in the RNA groove two NP-naproxen complexes of similar levels of interaction energy. The predicted naproxen binding sites were tested using the Y148A, R152A, R355A, and R361A proteins carrying single-point mutations. Surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence, and other in vitro experiments supported the notion that naproxen binds at a site identified by MD simulations and showed that naproxen competed with RNA binding to wild-type (WT) NP and protected active monomers of the nucleoprotein against proteolytic cleavage. Naproxen protected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells against viral challenges with the H1N1 and H3N2 viral strains and was much more effective than other cyclooxygenase inhibitors in decreasing viral titers of MDCK cells. In a mouse model of intranasal infection, naproxen treatment decreased the viral titers in mice lungs. In conclusion, naproxen is a promising lead compound for novel antivirals against influenza A virus that targets the nucleoprotein in its RNA binding groove.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes antiviral properties of naproxen targeting nucleoprotein, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza viruses with rearranged genomes as live-attenuated vaccines.
Abstract: H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza virus subtypes top the World Health Organization's list for the greatest pandemic potential. Inactivated H5N1 vaccines induce limited immune responses and, in the case of live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV), there are safety concerns regarding the possibility of reassortment between the H5 gene segment and circulating influenza viruses. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we rearranged the genome of an avian H9N2 influenza virus and expressed the entire H5 hemagglutinin open reading frame (ORF) from the segment 8 viral RNA. These vectors had reduced polymerase activities as well as viral replication in vitro and excellent safety profiles in vivo. Immunization with the dual H9-H5 influenza virus resulted in protection against lethal H5N1 challenge in mice and ferrets, and also against a potentially pandemic H9 virus. Our studies demonstrate that rearranging the influenza virus genome has great potential for the development of improved vaccines against influenza virus as well as other pathogens.

Title: Development of a neutralization assay for influenza virus using an endpoint assessment based on quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.
Abstract: A microneutralization assay using an ELISA-based endpoint assessment (ELISA-MN) is widely used to measure the serological response to influenza virus infection and vaccination. We have developed an alternative microneutralization assay for influenza virus using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR-based endpoint assessment (qPCR-MN) in order to improve upon technical limitations associated with ELISA-MN. For qPCR-MN, infected MDCK-London cells in 96-well cell-culture plates are processed with minimal steps such that resulting samples are amenable to high-throughput analysis by downstream one-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; SYBR Green chemistry with primers targeting a conserved region of the M1 gene of influenza A viruses). The growth curves of three recent vaccine strains demonstrated that the qRT-PCR signal detected at 6 hours post-infection reflected an amplification of at least 100-fold over input. Using ferret antisera, we have established the feasibility of measuring virus neutralization at 6 hours post-infection, a duration likely confined to a single virus-replication cycle. The neutralization titer for qPCR-MN was defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution necessary to achieve a 90% inhibition of the qRT-PCR signal; this endpoint was found to be in agreement with ELISA-MN using the same critical reagents in each assay. qPCR-MN was robust with respect to assay duration (6 hours vs. 12 hours). In addition, qPCR-MN appeared to be compliant with the Percentage Law (i.e., virus neutralization results appear to be consistent over an input virus dose ranging from 500 to 12,000 TCID(50)). Compared with ELISA-MN, qPCR-MN might have inherent properties conducive to reducing intra- and inter-laboratory variability while affording suitability for automation and high-throughput uses. Finally, our qRT-PCR-based approach may be broadly applicable to the development of neutralization assays for a wide variety of viruses.

Title: An extract from the earthworm Eisenia fetida non-specifically inhibits the activity of influenza and adenoviruses.
Abstract: To test the in vitro antiviral activity of a crude tissue extract (CTE) from the earthworm Eisenia fetida, determine any effective components in the CTE, and elucidate possible mechanisms of action. A CTE was made by homogenizing earthworms, followed by treatment with ammonium sulfate, then thermal denaturation. Inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was used to assess antiviral activity. Chromatographic analysis was used to identify effective components in the CTE. The CTE inhibited viral CPE at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Chromatography indicated that antiviral components corresponded to three active peaks indicative of proteases, nucleases and lysozymes. For adenoviruses, reduction in viral activity occurred for 100 microg/mL CTE. The reduction in adenoviral activity for four fractions was 100%, 91.8%, 86.9%, and 94.7%. For influenza viruses, reduction in viral activity of 100%, 86.6%, 69.1% and 88.3% was observed for 37 microg/mL CTE. In addition, three active fractions mixture had stronger antiviral activity (98.7% and 96.7%) than three fractions alone. Gel electrophoresis results indicated that nucleases from E. fetida could degrade the genome of influenza viruses and adenoviruses. The earthworm CTE displayed non-specific antiviral properties, possibly mediated by a combination of proteases, nucleases and lysozymes. Nucleases likely participate in the antiviral process, and degrade the genome of the virus thereby preventing further replication.

Title: Viral population analysis and minority-variant detection using short read next-generation sequencing.
Abstract: RNA viruses within infected individuals exist as a population of evolutionary-related variants. Owing to evolutionary change affecting the constitution of this population, the frequency and/or occurrence of individual viral variants can show marked or subtle fluctuations. Since the development of massively parallel sequencing platforms, such viral populations can now be investigated to unprecedented resolution. A critical problem with such analyses is the presence of sequencing-related errors that obscure the identification of true biological variants present at low frequency. Here, we report the development and assessment of the Quality Assessment of Short Read (QUASR) Pipeline (http://sourceforge.net/projects/quasr) specific for virus genome short read analysis that minimizes sequencing errors from multiple deep-sequencing platforms, and enables post-mapping analysis of the minority variants within the viral population. QUASR significantly reduces the error-related noise in deep-sequencing datasets, resulting in increased mapping accuracy and reduction of erroneous mutations. Using QUASR, we have determined influenza virus genome dynamics in sequential samples from an in vitro evolution of 2009 pandemic H1N1 (A/H1N1/09) influenza from samples sequenced on both the Roche 454 GSFLX and Illumina GAIIx platforms. Importantly, concordance between the 454 and Illumina sequencing allowed unambiguous minority-variant detection and accurate determination of virus population turnover in vitro.

Title: Contrasting the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza spatial transmission.
Abstract: In the past decade, rapid increases in the availability of high-resolution molecular and epidemiological data, combined with developments in statistical and computational methods to simulate and infer migration patterns, have provided key insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza A viruses in humans. In this review, we contrast findings from epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission at different spatial scales. We show that findings are broadly consistent in large-scale studies of inter-regional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions, revealing intense epidemics associated with multiple viral introductions, followed by deep troughs driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, aspects of the global transmission dynamics of influenza viruses are still debated, especially with respect to the existence of tropical source populations experiencing high levels of genetic diversity and the extent of prolonged viral persistence between epidemics. At the scale of a country or community, epidemiological studies have revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, which were not identified in molecular studies. We discuss the role of sampling issues in generating these conflicting results, and suggest strategies for future research that may help to fully integrate the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus over space and time.

Title: Anti-influenza A virus characteristics of a fucoidan from sporophyll of Undaria pinnatifida in mice with normal and compromised immunity.
Abstract: Undaria pinnatifida, an edible brown alga, contains fucoidan (FuC), a sulfated polysaccharide, that inhibited the in vitro replication of influenza A virus, and stimulated both innate and adaptive immune defense functions in virus-infected mice. In the present study, the effects of oral administration of FuC were evaluated on influenza virus infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice, where the efficacy of FuC was demonstrated in reducing viral replication, decreasing weight loss and mortality, and prolonging survival. Oral FuC resulted in increased neutralizing antibody production in the mucosa and blood. In contrast, while suppressing virus yields in mice more markedly than FuC, oseltamivir significantly reduced the neutralizing antibody titers in both the mucosa and blood. In immunocompromised mice, drug-resistant viruses frequently recovered after oseltamivir treatment; no resistant viruses were isolated from FuC-treated mice. FuC could be a candidate for the development of new therapeutic options including its combination with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir.

Title: Sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc)-bearing liposomal decoys capture influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza is a severe disease in humans and animals with few effective therapies available. All strains of influenza virus are prone to developing drug resistance due to the high mutation rate in the viral genome. A therapeutic agent that targets a highly conserved region of the virus could bypass resistance and also be effective against multiple strains of influenza. Influenza uses many individually weak ligand binding interactions for a high avidity multivalent attachment to sialic acid-bearing cells. Polymerized sialic acid analogs can form multivalent interactions with influenza but are not ideal therapeutics due to solubility and toxicity issues. We used liposomes as a novel means for delivery of the glycan sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc). LSTc-bearing decoy liposomes form multivalent, polymer-like interactions with influenza virus. Decoy liposomes competitively bind influenza virus in hemagglutination inhibition assays and inhibit infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition is specific for influenza virus, as inhibition of Sendai virus and respiratory syncytial virus is not observed. In contrast, monovalent LSTc does not bind influenza virus or inhibit infectivity. LSTc decoy liposomes prevent the spread of influenza virus during multiple rounds of replication in vitro and extend survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of virus. LSTc decoy liposomes co-localize with fluorescently tagged influenza virus, whereas control liposomes do not. Considering the conservation of the hemagglutinin binding pocket and the ability of decoy liposomes to form high avidity interactions with influenza hemagglutinin, our decoy liposomes have potential as a new therapeutic agent against emerging influenza strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes development of liposomal decoys targeting conserved viral regions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Drivers and consequences of influenza antiviral resistant-strain emergence in a capacity-constrained pandemic response.
Abstract: Antiviral agents remain a key component of most pandemic influenza preparedness plans, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding their optimal use. In particular, concerns exist regarding the likelihood of wide-scale distribution to select for drug-resistant variants. We used a model that considers the influence of logistical constraints on diagnosis and drug delivery to consider achievable 'reach' of alternative antiviral intervention strategies targeted at cases of varying severity, with or without pre-exposure prophylaxis of contacts. To identify key drivers of epidemic mitigation and resistance emergence, we used Latin hypercube sampling to explore plausible ranges of parameters describing characteristics of wild type and resistant viruses, along with intervention efficacy, target coverage and distribution capacity. Within our model framework, 'real world' constraints substantially reduced achievable drug coverage below stated targets as the epidemic progressed. In consequence, predictions of both intervention impact and selection for resistance were more modest than earlier work that did not consider such limitations. Definitive containment of transmission was unlikely but, where observed, achieved through early liberal post-exposure prophylaxis of known contacts of treated cases. Predictors of resistant strain dominance were high intrinsic fitness relative to the wild type virus, and early emergence in the course of the epidemic into a largely susceptible population, even when drug use was restricted to severe case treatment. Our work demonstrates the importance of consideration of 'real world' constraints in scenario analysis modeling, and highlights the utility of models to guide surveillance activities in preparedness and response.

Reason: Modeling study on antiviral resistance emergence and pandemic response; focuses on epidemiological and intervention parameters rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A cell-based screening system for influenza A viral RNA transcription/replication inhibitors.
Abstract: Although two classes of antivirals, NA inhibitors and M2 ion channel blockers, are licensed for influenza treatment, dual resistant mutants, including highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, have appeared. Alternative treatment options are, therefore, needed. Influenza A viral RNA (vRNA) transcription/replication is a promising target for antiviral development, since it is essential for virus replication. Accordingly, an efficient and reliable method to identify vRNA transcription/replication inhibitors is desirable. Here, we developed a cell-based screening system by establishing a cell line that stably expresses influenza viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Compound library screening using this cell line allowed us to identify a compound that inhibits vRNA transcription/replication by using reporter protein expression from virus-like RNA as a readout and virus replication in vitro. vRNP-expressing cells have potential as a simple and convenient high-throughput screening (HTS) system, and, thus, are promising to identify vRNA transcription/replication inhibitors for various RNA viruses, especially for primary screens.

Title: An assay suitable for high throughput screening of anti-influenza drugs.
Abstract: We developed a novel drug screening system for anti-influenza A virus by targeting the M2 proton channel. In the SPP (Single Protein Production) system, E. coli cell growth occurs only in the presence of effective M2 channel inhibitors, and thus simple measurement of cell growth was used as readouts for drug screening. Two potential inhibitors for M2 (V27A) mutant were verified using this method, which inhibit both the mutant and wild-type M2 channels.

Title: An overview of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.
Abstract: Since the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection was reported in 1997, this highly pathogenic virus has infected hundreds of people around the world and resulted in many deaths. The ability of H5N1 to cross species boundaries, and the presence of polymorphisms that enhance virulence, present challenges to developing clear strategies to prevent the pandemic spread of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. This review summarizes the current understanding of, and recent research on, the avian influenza H5N1 virus, including transmission, virulence, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention.

Title: Antibody repertoire development in fetal and neonatal piglets. XVI. Influenza stimulates adaptive immunity, class switch and diversification of the IgG repertoire encoded by downstream Cγ genes.
Abstract: Infection of germ-free isolator piglets with swine influenza (S-FLU) that generates dsRNA during replication causes elevation of immunoglobulins in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage, a very weak response to trinitrophenyl conjugates but an immune response to S-FLU. The increased immunoglobulin levels result mainly from the polyclonal activation of B cells during the infection, but model antigen exposure may contribute. The 10-fold increase in local and serum IgG accompanies a 10-fold decrease in the transcription of IgG3 in the tracheal-bronchial lymph nodes and in the ileal Peyer's patches. Infection results in class switch recombination to downstream Cγ genes, which diversify their repertoire; both features are diagnostic of adaptive immunity. Meanwhile the repertoires of IgM and IgG3 remain undiversified suggesting that they encode innate, natural antibodies. Whereas IgG3 may play an initial protective role, antibodies encoded by downstream Cγ genes with diversified repertoires are predicted to be most important in long-term protection against S-FLU.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antibody repertoire development in piglets after influenza infection, emphasizing immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenza--future perspectives.
Abstract: Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.

Title: Surveillance for antiviral resistance.
Abstract: In the 10 years since licensure of neuraminidase inhibitor drugs, their use has steadily increased, especially during the pandemic of 2009. Experience now indicates that factors which influence the emergence of high level resistance include the nature of drug binding to target, viral subtype, the use of post exposure prophylaxis and a lack of immunity in the host as seen in children and immunocompromised individuals. These factors point towards targetted surveillance programmes for the early identification of transmissible drug resistance.

Abstract: Influenza A viruses circulating in pigs in Brazil are still not characterized, and only limited data are available about swine influenza epidemiology in the country. Therefore, we characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza viruses isolated from Brazilian pigs. We also evaluated one case of probable swine-to-human transmission. Twenty influenza viruses isolated from pigs during 2009-2010 in five Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso) were used. One human isolate, from a technician who became ill after visiting a swineherd going through a respiratory disease outbreak, was also used in the study. Phylogenetic analysis for the HA and NA genes and hemagglutinin amino acid sequence alignment were performed. All isolates clustered with pandemic H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) viruses and appeared to have a common ancestor. Genetic diversity was higher in the HA than in the NA gene, and the amino acid substitution S203T in one of HA's antigenic sites was found in most of the samples. The human isolate was more related to swine isolates from the same herd visited by the technician than to other human isolates, suggesting swine-to-human transmission. Our results show that pH1N1 was disseminated and the predominant subtype in Brazilian pigs in 2009-2010.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes genetic sequences of influenza viruses in pigs but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: New approaches for unravelling reassortment pathways.
Abstract: Every year the human population encounters epidemic outbreaks of influenza, and history reveals recurring pandemics that have had devastating consequences. The current work focuses on the development of a robust algorithm for detecting influenza strains that have a composite genomic architecture. These influenza subtypes can be generated through a reassortment process, whereby a virus can inherit gene segments from two different types of influenza particles during replication. Reassortant strains are often not immediately recognised by the adaptive immune system of the hosts and hence may be the source of pandemic outbreaks. Owing to their importance in public health and their infectious ability, it is essential to identify reassortant influenza strains in order to understand the evolution of this virus and describe reassortment pathways that may be biased towards particular viral segments. Phylogenetic methods have been used traditionally to identify reassortant viruses. In many studies up to now, the assumption has been that if two phylogenetic trees differ, it is because reassortment has caused them to be different. While phylogenetic incongruence may be caused by real differences in evolutionary history, it can also be the result of phylogenetic error. Therefore, we wish to develop a method for distinguishing between topological inconsistency that is due to confounding effects and topological inconsistency that is due to reassortment. The current work describes the implementation of two approaches for robustly identifying reassortment events. The algorithms rest on the idea of significance of difference between phylogenetic trees or phylogenetic tree sets, and subtree pruning and regrafting operations, which mimic the effect of reassortment on tree topologies. The first method is based on a maximum likelihood (ML) framework (MLreassort) and the second implements a Bayesian approach (Breassort) for reassortment detection. We focus on reassortment events that are found by both methods. We test both methods on a simulated dataset and on a small collection of real viral data isolated in Hong Kong in 1999. The nature of segmented viral genomes present many challenges with respect to disease. The algorithms developed here can effectively identify reassortment events in small viral datasets and can be applied not only to influenza but also to other segmented viruses. Owing to computational demands of comparing tree topologies, further development in this area is necessary to allow their application to larger datasets.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on computational methods to detect reassortment events (genotype changes) but does not explicitly link these to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza monitoring in Sardinia, Italy identifies H3 subtype in Mediterranean wild migratory birds.
Abstract: Wild migratory birds are global distributors of pathogens. Sardinia, Italy, is the second largest Island in the Mediterranean and is a land bridge between Europe and Africa. We designed a surveillance protocol to investigate wild migratory birds for presence, frequency, and type of avian influenza viruses. We collected over 4,000 avian samples and compared three sampling methods, fecal, cloacal, and tracheal, to determine the most productive for virus identification. To determine frequency of infection, RNA was extracted and RT-PCRs for avian influenza virus genes were run. Positive samples were cultivated for live virus, sub typed and sequenced. Forty-four samples were positive for influenza nucleoprotein gene. We identified two previously unidentified H3 subtype strains and found cloacae to have the highest rate of virus identification and fecal sampling to provide quality RNA and repeatable results for determination of virus presence. Our investigation provides information on the frequency of Mediterranean avian influenza viruses, and validates the initiation of an avian influenza surveillance protocol.  Taken together with global avian influenza findings, these results give insight into infectious disease distributions which is important for viral pandemic monitoring and design of preventative measures.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports surveillance and identification of influenza subtypes in wild birds but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of low copies of drug-resistant influenza viral gene by a single-tube reaction using peptide nucleic acid as both PCR clamp and sensor probe.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection causes endemics almost yearly and pandemics occasionally. Although antivirals are available for the clinical treatment of influenza virus infection, the emergence of a drug-resistant virus has reduced the effectiveness of therapy and prophylaxis. Therefore, the timely detection of drug-resistant influenza viruses is important. A single-tube reaction using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as both a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clamp and a sensor probe was established to detect the low numbers of copies of viral genes that carry the resistant marker. Influenza A H1N1 viruses resistant to a clinically used antiviral, amantadine, are selected for the experimental design. The PNA-mediated reverse transcription-PCR detected 10 copies/μL of RNA from the resistant strain among 2 × 10(4) copies/μL of RNA from the sensitive strain. A rapid and sensitive method was established for detecting low numbers of drug-resistant genes of the influenza virus. The assay would help to monitorthe emergence of adrug-resistant influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a detection method for drug-resistant viral genes but does not link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Vaccinia and influenza A viruses select rather than adjust tRNAs to optimize translation.
Abstract: Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are central to protein synthesis and impact translational speed and fidelity by their abundance. Here we examine the extent to which viruses manipulate tRNA populations to favor translation of their own genes. We study two very different viruses: influenza A virus (IAV), a medium-sized (13 kB genome) RNA virus; and vaccinia virus (VV), a large (200 kB genome) DNA virus. We show that the total cellular tRNA population remains unchanged following viral infection, whereas the polysome-associated tRNA population changes dramatically in a virus-specific manner. The changes in polysome-associated tRNA levels reflect the codon usage of viral genes, suggesting the existence of local tRNA pools optimized for viral translation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on tRNA populations and translation optimization by viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes such as virulence, replication, or host response.

Title: Categorical spectral analysis of periodicity in human and viral genomes.
Abstract: Periodicity in nucleotide sequences arises from regular repeating patterns which may reflect important structure and function. Although a three-base periodicity in coding regions has been known for some time and has provided the basis for powerful gene prediction algorithms, its origins are still not fully understood. Here, we show that, contrary to common belief, amino acid (AA) bias and codon usage bias are insufficient to create base-3 periodicity. This article applies the rigorous method of spectral envelope to systematically characterize the contributions of codon bias, AA bias and protein structural motifs to the three-base periodicity of coding sequences. The method is also used to classify CpG islands in the human genome. In addition, we show how spectral envelope can be used to trace the evolution of viral genomes and monitor global sequence changes without having to align to previously known genomes. This approach also detects reassortment events, such as those that led to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a computational/spectral analysis of genome periodicity and evolution, including viral genomes, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: An in vitro network of intermolecular interactions between viral RNA segments of an avian H5N2 influenza A virus: comparison with a human H3N2 virus.
Abstract: The genome of influenza A viruses (IAV) is split into eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) that are encapsidated as viral ribonucleoproteins. The existence of a segment-specific packaging mechanism is well established, but the molecular basis of this mechanism remains to be deciphered. Selective packaging could be mediated by direct interaction between the vRNA packaging regions, but such interactions have never been demonstrated in virions. Recently, we showed that the eight vRNAs of a human H3N2 IAV form a single interaction network in vitro that involves regions of the vRNAs known to contain packaging signals in the case of H1N1 IAV strains. Here, we show that the eight vRNAs of an avian H5N2 IAV also form a single network of interactions in vitro, but, interestingly, the interactions and the regions of the vRNAs they involve differ from those described for the human H3N2 virus. We identified the vRNA sequences involved in five of these interactions at the nucleotide level, and in two cases, we validated the existence of the interaction using compensatory mutations in the interacting sequences. Electron tomography also revealed significant differences in the interactions taking place between viral ribonucleoproteins in H5N2 and H3N2 virions, despite their canonical '7 + 1' arrangement.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates in vitro RNA-RNA interactions among viral RNA segments of H5N2 and H3N2 viruses, focusing on packaging mechanisms, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification and structural characterization of a broadly neutralizing antibody targeting a novel conserved epitope on the influenza virus H5N1 hemagglutinin.
Abstract: The unabated circulation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus/H5N1 continues to be a serious threat to public health worldwide. Because of the high frequency of naturally occurring mutations, the emergence of H5N1 variants with high virulence has raised great concerns about the potential transmissibility of the virus in humans. Recent studies have shown that laboratory-mutated or reassortant H5N1 viruses could be efficiently transmitted among mammals, particularly ferrets, the best animal model for humans. Thus, it is critical to establish effective strategies to combat future H5N1 pandemics. In this study, we identified a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), HA-7, that potently neutralized all tested strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1, 2.2, 2.3.4, and 2.3.2.1 and completely protected mice against lethal challenges of H5N1 viruses from clades 1 and 2.3.4. HA-7 specifically targeted the globular head of the H5N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA). Using electron microscopy technology with three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-EM), we discovered that HA-7 bound to a novel and highly conserved conformational epitope that was centered on residues 81 to 83 and 117 to 122 of HA1 (H5 numbering). We further demonstrated that HA-7 inhibited viral entry during postattachment events but not at the receptor-binding step, which is fully consistent with the 3D-EM result. Taken together, we propose that HA-7 could be humanized as an effective passive immunotherapeutic agent for antiviral stockpiling for future influenza pandemics caused by emerging unpredictable H5N1 strains. Our study also provides a sound foundation for the rational design of vaccines capable of inducing broad-spectrum immunity against H5N1.

Reason: The paper identifies and characterizes a broadly neutralizing antibody targeting a conserved epitope on H5N1 hemagglutinin, focusing on immunology and structural biology rather than linking viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: A rigid bicyclic platform for the generation of conformationally locked neuraminidase inhibitors.
Abstract: Rapid mutation of the influenza virus through genetic mixing raises the prospect of new strains that are both highly transmissible and highly lethal, and which have the ability to evade both immunization strategies (through mutation of hemagglutinin) and current therapies (through mutation of neuraminidase). Inspired by a need for next-generation therapeutics, a synthetic strategy for a new class of rigid, bicyclic inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase is reported.

Title: Organization of the influenza virus replication machinery.
Abstract: Influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are central to the viral life cycle and in adaptation to new host species. RNPs are composed of the viral genome, viral polymerase, and many copies of the viral nucleoprotein. In vitro cell expression of all RNP protein components with four of the eight influenza virus gene segments enabled structural determination of native influenza virus RNPs by means of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The cryo-EM structure reveals the architecture and organization of the native RNP, defining the attributes of its largely helical structure and how polymerase interacts with nucleoprotein and the viral genome. Observations of branched-RNP structures in negative-stain electron microscopy and their putative identification as replication intermediates suggest a mechanism for viral replication by a second polymerase on the RNP template.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes structural organization of influenza virus replication machinery without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Pandemic influenza A virus codon usage revisited: biases, adaptation and implications for vaccine strain development.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains eight segments of a single-stranded RNA genome with negative polarity. The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared in April of 2009, with the emergence of a novel H1N1 IAV strain (H1N1pdm) in Mexico and USA. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. A comprehensive study to investigate the effect of selection pressure imposed by the human host on the codon usage of an emerging, pandemic IAV strain and the trends in viral codon usage involved over the pandemic time period is much needed. We performed a comprehensive codon usage analysis of 310 IAV strains from the pandemic of 2009. Highly biased codon usage for Ala, Arg, Pro, Thr and Ser were found. Codon usage is strongly influenced by underlying biases in base composition. When correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is applied, the distribution of IAV ORFs in the plane defined by the first two major dimensional factors showed that different strains are located at different places, suggesting that IAV codon usage also reflects an evolutionary process. A general association between codon usage bias, base composition and poor adaptation of the virus to the respective host tRNA pool, suggests that mutational pressure is the main force shaping H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage. A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments. Recoding of IAV taking into account codon bias, base composition and adaptation to host tRNA may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines.

Title: The evolutionary pattern of glycosylation sites in influenza virus (H5N1) hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.
Abstract: Two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), on the surface of influenza viruses play crucial roles in transfaunation, membrane fusion and the release of progeny virions. To explore the distribution of N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) in these two glycoproteins, we collected and aligned the amino acid sequences of all the HA and NA subtypes. Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes. Two to four conserved glycosites were found in the stalk domain of NA, but these are affected by the deletion of specific stalk domain sequences. Another highly conserved glycosite appeared at the top center of tetrameric global domain, while the others glycosites were distributed around the global domain. Here we present a detailed investigation of the distribution and the evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, and further focus on the H5N1 virus and conclude that the glycosites in H5N1 have become more complicated in HA and less influential in NA in the last five years.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the distribution and evolution of glycosylation sites but does not explicitly link these genotypic changes to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Targeting organic anion transporter 3 with probenecid as a novel anti-influenza a virus strategy.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection is a major global health concern causing significant mortality, morbidity, and economic loss. Antiviral chemotherapeutics that target influenza A virus are available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains has been reported. Consequently, there is a burgeoning need to identify novel anti-influenza A drugs, particularly those that target host gene products required for virus replication, to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance. In this study, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen was performed to identify host druggable gene targets for anti-influenza A virus therapy. The host organic anion transporter-3 gene (OAT3), a member of the SLC22 family of transporters, was validated as being required to support influenza A virus replication. Probenecid, a prototypical uricosuric agent and chemical inhibitor of organic anion transporters known to target OAT3, was shown to be effective in limiting influenza A virus infection in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] of 5.0 × 10(-5) to 5.0 × 10(-4) μM; P < 0.005) and in vivo (P < 0.05). Probenecid is widely used for treatment of gout and related hyperuricemic disorders, has been extensively studied for pharmacokinetics and safety, and represents an excellent candidate for drug repositioning as a novel anti-influenza A chemotherapeutic.

Title: In silico biology of H1N1: molecular modelling of novel receptors and docking studies of inhibitors to reveal new insight in flu treatment.
Abstract: Influenza is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The new influenza H1N1 viral stain has emerged by the genetic combination of genes from human, pig, and bird's H1N1 virus. The influenza virus is roughly spherical and is enveloped by a lipid membrane. There are two glycoproteins in this lipid membrane; namely, hemagglutinin (HA) which helps in attachment of the viral strain on the host cell surface and neuraminidase (NA) that is responsible for initiation of viral infection. We have developed homology models of both Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase receptors from H1N1 strains in eastern India. The docking studies of B-Sialic acid and O-Sialic acid in the optimized and energy-minimized homology models show important H-bonding interactions with ALA142, ASP230, GLN231, GLU232, and THR141. This information can be used for structure-based and pharmacophore-based new drug design. We have also calculated ADME properties (Human Oral Absorption (HOA) and % HOA) for Oseltamivir which have been subject of debate for long.

Abstract: From the deadly 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic to the looming threat of bird flu H5N1, the recent outbreak of swine flu H3N2v at agriculture fairs, and the emergence of drug-resistant H1N1, we are constantly challenged by influenza viruses. Vaccination remains the main strategy for prevention. With the knowledge gained from past pandemics, an adequate vaccine supply, and an updated preventive strategy, we are in a better position to face the challenge.

Title: Delayed emergence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A (H1N1) and pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar.
Abstract: The prevalence and timing of emergence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal and pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses in Myanmar in 2008 and 2009 are described in this report. In 2008, the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 virus was detected at a lower rate (6%) and emerged at least 2 months later when compared with neighboring countries. Similarly, the prevalence of pandemic H1N1 virus was low (3%) and the timing of emergence was late (August 2009) in Myanmar. Interestingly, we detected three isolates that were resistant to both amantadine and oseltamivir. Limited movement of people into the country is attributed to the delayed emergence of drug-resistant seasonal and pandemic A(H1N1) viruses.

The strain proved to be a monoreassortant strain with a typical porcine N1 gene on the genetic backbone of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus strain. Monitoring of descendants of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 strain is needed because of concerns that more-virulent strains may emerge in forthcoming epidemic seasons.

Title: Live attenuated influenza viruses produced in a suspension process with avian AGE1.CR.pIX cells.
Abstract: Current influenza vaccines are trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated split or subunit vaccines administered intramuscularly, or live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) adapted to replicate at temperatures below body temperature and administered intranasally. Both vaccines are considered safe and efficient, but due to differences in specific properties may complement each other to ensure reliable vaccine coverage. By now, licensed LAIV are produced in embryonated chicken eggs. In the near future influenza vaccines for human use will also be available from adherent MDCK or Vero cell cultures, but a scalable suspension process may facilitate production and supply with vaccines. We evaluated the production of cold-adapted human influenza virus strains in the duck suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX using a chemically-defined medium. One cold-adapted A (H1N1) and one cold-adapted B virus strain was tested, as well as the reference strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). It is shown that a medium exchange is not required for infection and that maximum virus titers are obtained for 1 × 10⁻⁶ trypsin units per cell. 1 L bioreactor cultivations showed that 4 × 10⁶ cells/mL can be infected without a cell density effect achieving titers of 1 × 10⁸ virions/mL after 24 h. Overall, this study demonstrates that AGE1.CR.pIX cells support replication of LAIV strains in a chemically-defined medium using a simple process without medium exchanges. Moreover, the process is fast with peak titers obtained 24 h post infection and easily scalable to industrial volumes as neither microcarriers nor medium replacements are required.

Title: Fluorescence molecular painting of enveloped viruses.
Abstract: In this study, we describe a versatile, flexible, and quick method to label different families of enveloped viruses with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified green fluorescent protein, termed fluorescence molecular painting (FMP). As an example for a potential application, we investigated virus attachment by means of flow cytometry to determine if viral binding behavior may be analyzed after FMP of enveloped viruses. Virus attachment was inhibited by using either dextran sulfate or by blocking attachment sites with virus pre-treatment. Results from the FMP-flow cytometry approach were verified by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Since the modification strategy is applicable to a broad range of proteins and viruses, variations of this method may be useful in a range of research and applied applications from bio-distribution studies to vaccine development and targeted infection for gene delivery.

Title: High-performance method for specific effect on nucleic acids in cells using TiO2~DNA nanocomposites.
Abstract: Nanoparticles are used to solve the current drug delivery problem. We present a high-performance method for efficient and selective action on nucleic acid target in cells using unique TiO(2)·PL-DNA nanocomposites (polylysine-containing DNA fragments noncovalently immobilized onto TiO(2) nanoparticles capable of transferring DNA). These nanocomposites were used for inhibition of human influenza A (H3N2) virus replication in infected MDCK cells. They showed a low toxicity (TC(50) ≈ 1800 μg/ml) and a high antiviral activity (>99.9% inhibition of the virus replication). The specificity factor (antisense effect) appeared to depend on the delivery system of DNA fragments. This factor for nanocomposites is ten-times higher than for DNA in the presence of lipofectamine. IC(50) for nanocomposites was estimated to be 1.5 μg/ml (30 nM for DNA), so its selectivity index was calculated as ~1200. Thus, the proposed nanocomposites are prospective for therapeutic application.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a nanocomposite delivery system for antiviral DNA fragments without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Pinon shell polysaccharide enhances immunity against H9N2 avian influenza virus in chickens.
Abstract: This study investigated the potential of pinon shell polysaccharide (PSP) to enhance immunity against H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (H9N2 AIV) in chickens. The effect of PSP treatment and H9N2 virus infection after PSP pretreatment were investigated by [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 3-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay and analysis of major histocompatibility complex and cytokine mRNA expression. The in vivo effects on lymphocytes and serum antibody titers were also investigated. The IL-6 expression and antibody titers were enhanced in the first week after PSP treatment. These data indicate that prophylactic PSP administration reduces H9N2 AIV replication and promotes early humoral immune responses in young birds.

Title: Genome sequence of a natural reassortant H5N2 avian influenza virus from domestic mallard ducks in eastern China.
Abstract: Here, we report the genomic sequence of a Chinese reassortant H5N2 avian influenza virus which possessed the polybasic motif PLREKRRK-R/GL at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all eight genes were of the Eurasian lineage, five of which were highly homologous to the endemic clade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses and their H5N5 reassortant descendants. These data suggested that novel multisubtypic NA reassortants bearing the H5N1 backbone could be generated through genetic reassortment in H5N1 circulating regions, which will help in understanding the evolution and segment reassortment mechanism of H5 subtype avian influenza viruses.

Title: Recombinant parainfluenza virus 5 expressing hemagglutinin of influenza A virus H5N1 protected mice against lethal highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 challenge.
Abstract: A safe and effective vaccine is the best way to prevent large-scale highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in the human population. The current FDA-approved H5N1 vaccine has serious limitations. A more efficacious H5N1 vaccine is urgently needed. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, is not known to cause any illness in humans. PIV5 is an attractive vaccine vector. In our studies, a single dose of a live recombinant PIV5 expressing a hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H5N1 (rPIV5-H5) from the H5N1 subtype provided sterilizing immunity against lethal doses of HPAI H5N1 infection in mice. Furthermore, we have examined the effect of insertion of H5N1 HA at different locations within the PIV5 genome on the efficacy of a PIV5-based vaccine. Interestingly, insertion of H5N1 HA between the leader sequence, the de facto promoter of PIV5, and the first viral gene, nucleoprotein (NP), did not lead to a viable virus. Insertion of H5N1 HA between NP and the next gene, V/phosphorprotein (V/P), led to a virus that was defective in growth. We have found that insertion of H5N1 HA at the junction between the small hydrophobic (SH) gene and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene gave the best immunity against HPAI H5N1 challenge: a dose as low as 1,000 PFU was sufficient to protect against lethal HPAI H5N1 challenge in mice. The work suggests that recombinant PIV5 expressing H5N1 HA has great potential as an HPAI H5N1 vaccine.

Title: Humans with chronic granulomatous disease maintain humoral immunologic memory despite low frequencies of circulating memory B cells.
Abstract: CD27(+) memory B cells are reduced in the blood of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) for reasons and consequences that remain unclear. Here we confirm not only decreased CD27(+) but also IgG(+) B cells in the blood of CGD patients compared with healthy donors (HDs). However, among IgG(+) B cells, the ratio of CD27(-) to CD27(+) was significantly higher in CGD patients compared with HDs. Similar to conventional memory B cells, CD27(-)IgG(+) B cells of CGD patients expressed activation markers and had undergone somatic hypermutation, albeit at levels lower than their CD27(+) counterparts. Functional analyses revealed slight reductions in frequencies of total IgG but not influenza-specific memory B-cell responses, as measured by Elispot in CGD patients compared with HDs. Serum IgG levels and influenza-specific antibodies were also normal in these CGD patients. Finally, we provide evidence that influenza-specific memory B cells can be present within the CD27(-)IgG(+) B-cell compartment. Together, these findings show that, despite reduced circulating CD27(+) memory B cells, CGD patients maintain an intact humoral immunologic memory, with potential contribution from CD27(-) B cells.

Title: Annual survival of ruddy turnstones is not affected by natural infection with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: The population of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres morinella) that migrates through Delaware Bay has undergone severe declines in recent years, attributable to reduced availability of horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs at this critical spring migration stopover site. Concurrently, this population has experienced annual low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (AIV) epidemics at this same site. Using a prospective cohort study design with birds individually flagged during May-June 2006-2008, we evaluated resighting rates (a proxy for annual survival) between AIV-infected and uninfected birds at 1 yr after capture, testing, and measurement. Overall resighting rate was 46%, which varied by year and increased with relative mass of the bird when captured. Resighting rates were not different between AIV-infected and uninfected birds in any period. In multivariate analyses, infection status was also unrelated to resighting rate after controlling for year, day, state, sex, body size, mass index, or whether the bird was blood-sampled. Thus, apparent annual survival in ruddy turnstones was not reduced by AIV infection at this migratory stopover. However, it is unknown whether intestinal AIV infection might cause subtle reductions in weight gain which could negatively influence reproduction.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses survival of birds infected with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes explicitly.

Title: Structural insights into key sites of vulnerability on HIV-1 Env and influenza HA.
Abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are the surface glycoproteins responsible for viral entry into host cells, the first step in the virus life cycle necessary to initiate infection. These glycoproteins exhibit a high degree of sequence variability and glycosylation, which are used as strategies to escape host immune responses. Nonetheless, antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity against these viruses have been isolated that have managed to overcome these barriers. Here, we review recent advances in the structural characterization of these antibodies with their viral antigens that defines a few sites of vulnerability on these viral spikes. These broadly neutralizing antibodies tend to focus their recognition on the sites of similar function between the two viruses: the receptor-binding site and membrane fusion machinery. However, some sites of recognition are unique to the virus neutralized, such as the dense shield of oligomannose carbohydrates on HIV-1 Env. These observations are discussed in the context of structure-based design strategies to aid in vaccine design or development of antivirals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews structural insights into antibody binding sites on HIV-1 Env and influenza HA, focusing on immune recognition rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: A genome wide RNA interference screening method to identify host factors that modulate influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: The use of genome wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens to investigate host-virals interactions has revealed unexpected connections that have improved our understanding of viral pathogenesis and cell biology. This work describes the use of an RNAi screening method employing an immunofluorescence image-based strategy and influenza A virus. We find this approach to be readily implemented, scalable and amenable to the direct evaluation of a variety of viral lifecycles.
Relevant: False

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States and worldwide, May 20-September 22, 2012.
Abstract: During May 20-September 22, 2012, the United States experienced low levels of seasonal influenza activity overall; however, more seasonal influenza viruses were detected than in the summer months of previous years. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were detected worldwide and were identified sporadically in the United States. In July, influenza A (H3N2) variant viruses (H3N2v) were first detected in Indiana, and since July 12, a total of 306 cases have been reported from 10 states. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide since May 20, 2012.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an epidemiological update on influenza activity without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic properties of RNA viruses.
Abstract: A new word, phylodynamics, was coined to emphasize the interconnection between phylogenetic properties, as observed for instance in a phylogenetic tree, and the epidemic dynamics of viruses, where selection, mediated by the host immune response, and transmission play a crucial role. The challenges faced when investigating the evolution of RNA viruses call for a virtuous loop of data collection, data analysis and modeling. This already resulted both in the collection of massive sequences databases and in the formulation of hypotheses on the main mechanisms driving qualitative differences observed in the (reconstructed) evolutionary patterns of different RNA viruses. Qualitatively, it has been observed that selection driven by the host immune response induces an uneven survival ability among co-existing strains. As a consequence, the imbalance level of the phylogenetic tree is manifestly more pronounced if compared to the case when the interaction with the host immune system does not play a central role in the evolutive dynamics. While many imbalance metrics have been introduced, reliable methods to discriminate in a quantitative way different level of imbalance are still lacking. In our work, we reconstruct and analyze the phylogenetic trees of six RNA viruses, with a special emphasis on the human Influenza A virus, due to its relevance for vaccine preparation as well as for the theoretical challenges it poses due to its peculiar evolutionary dynamics. We focus in particular on topological properties. We point out the limitation featured by standard imbalance metrics, and we introduce a new methodology with which we assign the correct imbalance level of the phylogenetic trees, in agreement with the phylodynamics of the viruses. Our thorough quantitative analysis allows for a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of the considered RNA viruses, which is crucial in order to provide a valuable framework for a quantitative assessment of theoretical predictions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic properties and evolutionary dynamics without explicit links to viral phenotypes.

Title: Exacerbation of influenza virus infections in mice by intranasal treatments and implications for evaluation of antiviral drugs.
Abstract: Compounds lacking oral activity may be delivered intranasally to treat influenza virus infections in mice. However, intranasal treatments greatly enhance the virulence of such virus infections. This can be partially compensated for by giving reduced virus challenge doses. These can be 100- to 1,000-fold lower than infections without such treatment and still cause equivalent mortality. We found that intranasal liquid treatments facilitate virus production (probably through enhanced virus spread) and that lung pneumonia was delayed by only 2 days relative to a 1,000-fold higher virus challenge dose not accompanied by intranasal treatments. In one study, zanamivir was 90 to 100% effective at 10 mg/kg/day by oral, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular routes against influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus in mice. However, the same compound administered intranasally at 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days gave no protection from death although the time to death was significantly delayed. A related compound, Neu5Ac2en (N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid), was ineffective at 100 mg/kg/day. Intranasal zanamivir and Neu5Ac2en were 70 to 100% protective against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus infections at 0.1 to 10 and 30 to 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. Somewhat more difficult to treat was A/Victoria/3/75 virus that required 10 mg/kg/day of zanamivir to achieve full protection. These results illustrate that treatment of influenza virus infections by the intranasal route requires consideration of both virus challenge dose and virus strain in order to avoid compromising the effectiveness of a potentially useful antiviral agent. In addition, the intranasal treatments were shown to facilitate virus replication and promote lung pathology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses effects of intranasal treatments on virus infections and antiviral drug evaluation, not direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Targeting the host or the virus: current and novel concepts for antiviral approaches against influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to human health. The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders. At the same time, viruses as obligate intracellular pathogens have evolved to exploit cellular responses in support of their efficient replication, including antagonizing the host type I interferon response as well as activation of specific cellular pathways at different stages of the replication cycle. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus-host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new treatment regimens. This review aims to give an overview of current and novel concepts targeting the virus and the host for managing influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of antiviral approaches targeting virus or host, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Infectivity of H7 LP and HP influenza viruses at different temperatures and pH and persistence of H7 HP virus in poultry meat at refrigeration temperature.
Abstract: The aims of this study were to assess the infectivity of highly pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenicity (LP) H7 AI viruses at different temperatures and pH values and to investigate the persistance of HP H7 virus in chicken, turkey and duck meat. The H7 viruses tested remained infectious at +4°C and +20°C for 200 and >50 days, respectively. At pH 5, H7 viruses retained their infectivity for a shorter period of time compared to pH 7. The infectivity of HP H7 was detected >2 months in meat maintained at +4°C and was higher in chicken meat compared to turkey and duck meat. Results of this study show that higher temperatures and lower pH values both reduce virus infectivity and demonstrate that HP H7 virus can remain infectious in meat for extended periods of time.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses virus infectivity under different conditions but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Tissue distribution of sialic acid-linked influenza virus receptors in beagle dogs.
Abstract: Reports of influenza A virus infections in dogs has received considerable attention from veterinarians, virologists, and epidemiologists. Interaction between influenza viral hemagglutinin and cell oligosaccharides containing sialic acid residues results in infection. Sialic acids have an α-2,3-linkage to the penultimate galactose in the avian influenza virus receptor and an α-2,6-linkage in the human receptor. To date, there are no detailed data on the tissue distribution or histological features of either type of sialic acid-linked influenza virus receptors in beagle dogs, which are common laboratory animals and pets. We conducted the current study to visualize the in situ tissue distribution of both sialic acid-linked influenza virus receptors in various organs of beagle dogs using Maackia amurensis lectin II and Sambucus nigra agglutinin. Both α-2,3- and α-2,6-sialic acid-linked receptors were detected in the endothelial cells of the respiratory tract and other organs. Endothelial cells of most gastrointestinal organs were negative for α-2,3-sialic acid-linked receptors in the dogs. Our results suggested that these canine organs may be affected by influenza virus infection. The findings from our study will also help evaluate the occurrence and development of influenza virus infections in dogs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes tissue distribution of influenza virus receptors in dogs, not viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Dietary abscisic acid ameliorates influenza-virus-associated disease and pulmonary immunopathology through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism.
Abstract: The anti-inflammatory phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) modulates immune and inflammatory responses in mouse models of colitis and obesity. ABA has been identified as a ligand of lanthionine synthetase C-like 2, a novel therapeutic target upstream of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathway. The goal of this study was to investigate the immune modulatory mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory efficacy of ABA against influenza-associated pulmonary inflammation. Wild-type (WT) and conditional knockout mice with defective PPARγ expression in lung epithelial and hematopoietic cells (cKO) treated orally with or without ABA (100 mg/kg diet) were challenged with influenza A/Udorn (H3N2) to assess ABA's impact in disease, lung lesions and gene expression. Dietary ABA ameliorated disease activity and lung inflammatory pathology, accelerated recovery and increased survival in WT mice. ABA suppressed leukocyte infiltration and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mRNA expression in WT mice through PPARγ since this effect was abrogated in cKO mice. ABA ameliorated disease when administered therapeutically on the same day of the infection to WT but not mice lacking PPARγ in myeloid cells. We also show that ABA's greater impact is between days 7 and 10 postchallenge when it regulates the expression of genes involved in resolution, like 5-lipoxygenase and other members of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Furthermore, ABA significantly increased the expression of the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10 in WT mice. Our results show that ABA, given preventively or therapeutically, ameliorates influenza-virus-induced pathology by activating PPARγ in pulmonary immune cells, suppressing initial proinflammatory responses and promoting resolution.
Relevant: False

Title: Airway protease/antiprotease imbalance in atopic asthmatics contributes to increased influenza A virus cleavage and replication.
Abstract: Asthmatics are more susceptible to influenza infections, yet mechanisms mediating this enhanced susceptibility are unknown. Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein binds to sialic acid residues on the host cells. HA requires cleavage to allow fusion of the viral HA with host cell membrane, which is mediated by host trypsin-like serine protease. We show data here demonstrating that the protease:antiprotease ratio is increased in the nasal mucosa of asthmatics and that these changes were associated with increased proteolytic activation of influenza. These data suggest that disruption of the protease balance in asthmatics enhances activation and infection of influenza virus.
Relevant: False

Title: Cross-neutralization of influenza A viruses mediated by a single antibody loop.
Abstract: Immune recognition of protein antigens relies on the combined interaction of multiple antibody loops, which provide a fairly large footprint and constrain the size and shape of protein surfaces that can be targeted. Single protein loops can mediate extremely high-affinity binding, but it is unclear whether such a mechanism is available to antibodies. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an antibody called C05, which neutralizes strains from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H1, H2 and H3. X-ray and electron microscopy structures show that C05 recognizes conserved elements of the receptor-binding site on the haemagglutinin surface glycoprotein. Recognition of the haemagglutinin receptor-binding site is dominated by a single heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 loop, with minor contacts from heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 1, and is sufficient to achieve nanomolar binding with a minimal footprint. Thus, binding predominantly with a single loop can allow antibodies to target small, conserved functional sites on otherwise hypervariable antigens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes an antibody's neutralization mechanism but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus interacts with cellular processing bodies and stress granules through RNA-associated protein 55 (RAP55) during virus infection.
Abstract: The nonstructural protein (NS1) of influenza A virus performs multiple functions in the virus life cycle. Proteomic screening for cellular proteins which interact with NS1 identified the cellular protein RAP55, which is one of the components of cellular processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules. To verify whether NS1 interacts with cellular P-bodies, interactions between NS1, RAP55, and other P-body-associated proteins (Ago1, Ago2, and DCP1a) were confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and cellular colocalization assays. Overexpression of RAP55 induced RAP55-associated stress granule formation and suppressed virus replication. Knockdown of RAP55 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or expression of a dominant-negative mutant RAP55 protein with defective interaction with P-bodies blocked NS1 colocalization to P-bodies in cells. Expression of NS1 inhibited RAP55 expression and formation of RAP55-associated P-bodies/stress granules. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) was found to be targeted to stress granules in the absence of NS1 but localized to P-bodies when NS1 was coexpressed. Restriction of virus replication via P-bodies occurred in the early phases of infection, as the number of RAP55-associated P-bodies in cells diminished over the course of virus infection. NS1 interaction with RAP55-associated P-bodies/stress granules was associated with RNA binding and mediated via a protein kinase R (PKR)-interacting viral element. Mutations introduced into either RNA binding sites (R38 and K41) or PKR interaction sites (I123, M124, K126, and N127) caused NS1 proteins to lose the ability to interact with RAP55 and to inhibit stress granules. These results reveal an interplay between virus and host during virus replication in which NP is targeted to P-bodies/stress granules while NS1 counteracts this host restriction mechanism.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes interactions between viral NS1 protein and host cellular components but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Anti-influenza virus effects of elderberry juice and its fractions.
Abstract: Elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) has traditionally been used for treating influenza and colds. We evaluated the antiviral effect of concentrated juice of elderberry (CJ-E) on the human influenza A virus (IFV). CJ-E had a relatively strong effect on IFV-infected mice, although its anti-IFV activity was weak in a cell culture system. The in vivo anti-IFV activities of the fractions were determined after separating CJ-E by ultrafiltration and anion-exchange chromatography. Oral administration of the high-molecular-weight fractions of CJ-E to IFV-infected mice suppressed viral replication in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), and increased the level of the IFV-specific neutralizing antibody in the serum, as well as the level of secretory IgA in BALFs and feces. Fr. II from high-molecular-weight fraction HM, which contained acidic polysaccharides, showed relatively strong defense against IFV infection. We conclude that CJ-E had a beneficial effect by the stimulating immune response and preventing viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates antiviral effects of elderberry juice on influenza virus but does not discuss viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir: effects on resistance, immunization and stockpiling.
Abstract: In 2007 New Zealand (NZ) became the first country to make oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) available off-prescription. This study investigated the extent of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir over 5 years, including during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, and the impact of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir on influenza virus oseltamivir susceptibility, personal stockpiling and influenza vaccine uptake. Randomly selected community pharmacies in NZ reported oseltamivir provision by prescription and through pharmacist supply from 1 January 2007 to 15 September 2011. Oseltamivir resistance data on influenza viruses isolated during influenza surveillance from 2008 to 2011 were obtained, along with influenza vaccine uptake data from 2005 to 2011 and influenza detection data. Seventy of 85 eligible pharmacies completed the study (82% response rate). Most supplies of oseltamivir throughout the 5 years were dispensed against a prescription rather than pharmacist supplied, with pharmacist supply responsible for 11% of supplies during the pandemic years (2009-10) versus 27% and 31% during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Pharmacist-supplied oseltamivir did not appear to be associated with the development of resistance, with identified likely stockpiling or with a decline in influenza immunization. Pharmacist supplies largely matched the timing of influenza in the community and peaked in June 2009, as did prescription supplies. Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir in NZ has resulted in no significant change in the development of resistance or rates of influenza immunization. Supplies remained modest and significant consumer stockpiling through pharmacist supply has not occurred, even during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009 and 2010. Pharmacists could be better utilized in ensuring fast distribution of antivirals to influenza sufferers during a pandemic.

Title: Epidemiological dynamics and phylogeography of influenza virus in southern China.
Abstract: Understanding the epidemiological dynamics of influenza virus is central to surveillance and vaccine strain selection. It has been suggested that tropical and subtropical regions represent the global source of influenza epidemics. However, our understanding of the epidemiological dynamics of influenza virus in these regions is limited by a relative lack of long-term data. We analyzed epidemiological and virological data on influenza recorded over a period of 15 years from the metropolitan city of Shenzhen in subtropical southern China. We used wavelet analysis to determine the periodicity of influenza epidemics and molecular phylogeographic analysis to investigate the role of Shenzhen and southern China in the global evolution of influenza virus. We show that southern China is unlikely to represent an epicenter of global influenza activity, because activity in Shenzhen is characterized by significant annual cycles, multiple viral introductions every year, limited persistence across epidemic seasons, and viruses that generally are not positioned on the trunk of the global influenza virus phylogeny. We propose that novel influenza viruses emerge and evolve in multiple geographic localities and that the global evolution of influenza virus is complex and does not simply originate from a southern Chinese epicenter.

Reason: The study analyzes epidemiological and phylogeographic dynamics of influenza virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly dynamic microtubules improve the effectiveness of early stages of human influenza A/NWS/33 virus infection in LLC-MK2 cells.
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the role of microtubule dynamics in the initiation of NWS/33 human influenza A (NWS) virus infection in MDCK and LLC-MK2 mammalian kidney cells. We previously demonstrated a host-dependent role of the actin cytoskeleton in inducing restriction during the early phases of NWS infection. Furthermore, we showed the differential infectious entry of NWS virus in the above mentioned cell models. By first employing a panel of microtubule-modulators, we evidenced that microtubule-stabilization negatively interferes with NWS replication in LLC-MK2 but not in MDCK cells. Conversely, microtubule-depolymerization improves NWS growth in LLC-MK2 but not in the MDCK model. By using immunofluorescence labelling and Western blotting analyses upon NWS infection in mammalian kidney cells, it was observed that the occurrence of alpha-tubulin hyperacetylation--a post-translational modified form suggestive of stable microtubules--was significantly delayed in LLC-MK2 when compared to MDCK cells. Furthermore, mock-infected LLC-MK2 cells were shown to have higher levels of both acetylated alpha-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), the latter being essential for the maintenance of normal microtubule polymer levels in interphase epithelial cells. Finally, to obtain highly dynamic microtubules in LLC-MK2 cells, we knocked down the expression of MAP4 by using a RNA-mediated RNA interference approach. The results evidenced that MAP4 silencing improves NWS growth in LLC-MK2 cells. By evidencing the cell type-dependent regulatory role of microtubule dynamics on NWS replication in mammalian kidney cells, we demonstrated that microtubule-stabilization represents a restriction factor for the initiation of NWS infection in LLC-MK2 but not in MDCK cells.

Title: Molecular imaging reveals a progressive pulmonary inflammation in lower airways in ferrets infected with 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus.
Abstract: Molecular imaging has gained attention as a possible approach for the study of the progression of inflammation and disease dynamics. Herein we used [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) as a radiotracer for PET imaging coupled with CT (FDG-PET/CT) to gain insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammatory response of ferrets infected with a clinical isolate of a pandemic influenza virus, H1N1 (H1N1pdm). The thoracic regions of mock- and H1N1pdm-infected ferrets were imaged prior to infection and at 1, 2, 3 and 6 days post-infection (DPI). On 1 DPI, FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed areas of consolidation in the right caudal lobe which corresponded with elevated [(18)F]-FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax), 4.7-7.0). By days 2 and 3, consolidation (CT) and inflammation ([(18)F]-FDG) appeared in the left caudal lobe. By 6 DPI, CT images showed extensive areas of patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations with the largest lesions having high SUVMax (6.0-7.6). Viral shedding and replication were detected in most nasal, throat and rectal swabs and nasal turbinates and lungs on 1, 2 and 3 DPI, but not on day 7, respectively. In conclusion, molecular imaging of infected ferrets revealed a progressive consolidation on CT with corresponding [(18)F]-FDG uptake. Strong positive correlations were measured between SUVMax and bronchiolitis-related pathologic scoring (Spearman's ρ = 0.75). Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen on CT in the ferret model at 6 DPI are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections. In summary, these first molecular imaging studies of lower respiratory infection with H1N1pdm show that FDG-PET can give insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammation in real-time.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses molecular imaging to track inflammation progression in infected ferrets but does not analyze viral genotypes or link them to phenotypes.

Title: Obatoclax, saliphenylhalamide, and gemcitabine inhibit influenza a virus infection.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) infect humans and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Different treatment options have been developed; however, these were insufficient during recent IAV outbreaks. Here, we conducted a targeted chemical screen in human nonmalignant cells to validate known and search for novel host-directed antivirals. The screen validated saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and identified two novel anti-IAV agents, obatoclax and gemcitabine. Further experiments demonstrated that Mcl-1 (target of obatoclax) provides a novel host target for IAV treatment. Moreover, we showed that obatoclax and SaliPhe inhibited IAV uptake and gemcitabine suppressed viral RNA transcription and replication. These compounds possess broad spectrum antiviral activity, although their antiviral efficacies were virus-, cell type-, and species-specific. Altogether, our results suggest that phase II obatoclax, investigational SaliPhe, and FDA/EMEA-approved gemcitabine represent potent antiviral agents.

Title: A drug screening method based on the autophagy pathway and studies of the mechanism of evodiamine against influenza A virus.
Abstract: In this research, we have established a drug screening method based on the autophagy signal pathway using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) technique to develop novel anti-influenza A virus (IAV) drugs. We selected Evodia rutaecarpa Benth out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and explored the mechanisms of evodiamine, the major active component of Evodia rutaecarpa Benth, on anti-IAV activity. Our results showed that evodiamine could significantly inhibit IAV replication, as determined by a plaque inhibition assay, an IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter assay and the Sulforhodamine B method using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction. Additionally, evodiamine could significantly inhibit the accumulation of LC3-II and p62, and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. This compound also inhibited the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer, the expressions of Atg5, Atg7 and Atg12, and the cytokine release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 after IAV infection. Evodiamine inhibited IAV-induced autophagy was also dependent on its action on the AMPK/TSC2/mTOR signal pathway. In conclusion, we have established a new drug screening method, and selected evodiamine as a promising anti-IAV compound.

Title: Design and synthesis of a novel ganglioside ligand for influenza A viruses.
Abstract: A novel ganglioside bearing Neua2-3Gal and Neua2-6Gal structures as distal sequences was designed as a ligand for influenza A viruses. The efficient synthesis of the designed ganglioside was accomplished by employing the cassette coupling approach as a key reaction, which was executed between the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide and the cyclic glucosylceramide moiety. Examination of its binding activity to influenza A viruses revealed that the new ligand is recognized by Neua2-3 and 2-6 type viruses.

Title: Host modulators of H1N1 cytopathogenicity.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infects 5-20% of the population annually, resulting in ~35,000 deaths and significant morbidity. Current treatments include vaccines and drugs that target viral proteins. However, both of these approaches have limitations, as vaccines require yearly development and the rapid evolution of viral proteins gives rise to drug resistance. In consequence additional intervention strategies, that target host factors required for the viral life cycle, are under investigation. Here we employed arrayed whole-genome siRNA screening strategies to identify cell-autonomous molecular components that are subverted to support H1N1 influenza A virus infection of human bronchial epithelial cells. Integration across relevant public data sets exposed druggable gene products required for epithelial cell infection or required for viral proteins to deflect host cell suicide checkpoint activation. Pharmacological inhibition of representative targets, RGGT and CHEK1, resulted in significant protection against infection of human epithelial cells by the A/WS/33 virus. In addition, chemical inhibition of RGGT partially protected against H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. The observations reported here thus contribute to an expanding body of studies directed at decoding vulnerabilities in the command and control networks specified by influenza virulence factors.

Title: Human H-ficolin inhibits replication of seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The collectins have been shown to have a role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) and other significant viral pathogens (e.g., HIV). The ficolins are a related group of innate immune proteins that are present at relatively high concentrations in serum, but also in respiratory secretions; however, there has been little study of the role of ficolins in viral infection. In this study, we demonstrate that purified recombinant human H-ficolin and H-ficolin in human serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bind to IAV and inhibit viral infectivity and hemagglutination activity in vitro. Removal of ficolins from human serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid reduces their antiviral activity. Inhibition of IAV did not involve the calcium-dependent lectin activity of H-ficolin. We demonstrate that H-ficolin is sialylated and that removal of sialic acid abrogates IAV inhibition, while addition of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir potentiates neutralization, hemagglutinin inhibition, and viral aggregation caused by H-ficolin. Pandemic and mouse-adapted strains of IAV are generally not inhibited by the collectins surfactant protein D or mannose binding lectin because of a paucity of glycan attachments on the hemagglutinin of these strains. In contrast, H-ficolin inhibited both the mouse-adapted PR-8 H1N1 strain and a pandemic H1N1 strain from 2009. H-ficolin also fixed complement to a surface coated with IAV. These findings suggest that H-ficolin contributes to host defense against IAV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral activity of human H-ficolin against influenza viruses, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or genetic determinants of viral phenotypes.

Title: Memory CD4+ T cells protect against influenza through multiple synergizing mechanisms.
Abstract: Memory CD4+ T cells combat viral infection and contribute to protective immune responses through multiple mechanisms, but how these pathways interact is unclear. We found that several pathways involving memory CD4+ T cells act together to effectively clear influenza A virus (IAV) in otherwise unprimed mice. Memory CD4+ T cell protection was enhanced through synergy with naive B cells or CD8+ T cells and maximized when both were present. However, memory CD4+ T cells protected against lower viral doses independently of other lymphocytes through production of IFN-γ. Moreover, memory CD4+ T cells selected for epitope-specific viral escape mutants via a perforin-dependent pathway. By deconstructing protective immunity mediated by memory CD4+ T cells, we demonstrated that this population simultaneously acts through multiple pathways to provide a high level of protection that ensures eradication of rapidly mutating pathogens such as IAV. This redundancy indicates the need for reductionist approaches for delineating the individual mechanisms of protection mediated by memory CD4+ T cells responding to pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune mechanisms of memory CD4+ T cells against influenza virus, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Permissive and restricted virus infection of murine embryonic stem cells.
Abstract: Recent RNA interference (RNAi) studies have identified many host proteins that modulate virus infection, but small interfering RNA 'off-target' effects and the use of transformed cell lines limit their conclusiveness. As murine embryonic stem (mES) cells can be genetically modified and resources exist where many and eventually all known mouse genes are insertionally inactivated, it was reasoned that mES cells would provide a useful alternative to RNAi screens. Beyond allowing investigation of host-pathogen interactions in vitro, mES cells have the potential to differentiate into other primary cell types, as well as being used to generate knockout mice for in vivo studies. However, mES cells are poorly characterized for virus infection. To investigate whether ES cells can be used to explore host-virus interactions, this study characterized the responses of mES cells following infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus. HSV-1 replicated lytically in mES cells, although mES cells were less permissive than most other cell types tested. Influenza virus was able to enter mES cells and express some viral proteins, but the replication cycle was incomplete and no infectious virus was produced. Knockdown of the host protein AHCYL1 in mES cells reduced HSV-1 replication, showing the potential for using mES cells to study host-virus interactions. Transcriptional profiling, however, indicated the lack of an efficient innate immune response in these cells. mES cells may thus be useful to identify host proteins that play a role in virus replication, but they are not suitable to determine factors that are involved in innate host defence.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes murine embryonic stem cells' permissiveness to virus infection, focusing on host cell factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Cyclophilin A and viral infections.
Abstract: Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase originally identified as the target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A. A number of reports have demonstrated that CyPA plays a critical role in the successful replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), etc. However, recent studies demonstrated that CyPA also possesses a repressive effect on the replication of some viruses like Influenza A virus and rotavirus. Moreover, CyPA could also regulate host IFN-I response to viral infections. Together, these evidences showed diverse roles of CyPA in viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses the role of Cyclophilin A in viral infections generally, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionary history and phylodynamics of influenza A and B neuraminidase (NA) genes inferred from large-scale sequence analyses.
Abstract: Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important surface glycoprotein and plays a vital role in viral replication and drug development. The NA is found in influenza A and B viruses, with nine subtypes classified in influenza A. The complete knowledge of influenza NA evolutionary history and phylodynamics, although critical for the prevention and control of influenza epidemics and pandemics, remains lacking. Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of influenza NA sequences using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods demonstrated that the divergence of influenza viruses into types A and B occurred earlier than the divergence of influenza A NA subtypes. Twenty-three lineages were identified within influenza A, two lineages were classified within influenza B, and most lineages were specific to host, subtype or geographical location. Interestingly, evolutionary rates vary not only among lineages but also among branches within lineages. The estimated tMRCAs of influenza lineages suggest that the viruses of different lineages emerge several months or even years before their initial detection. The d(N)/d(S) ratios ranged from 0.062 to 0.313 for influenza A lineages, and 0.257 to 0.259 for influenza B lineages. Structural analyses revealed that all positively selected sites are at the surface of the NA protein, with a number of sites found to be important for host antibody and drug binding. The divergence into influenza type A and B from a putative ancestral NA was followed by the divergence of type A into nine NA subtypes, of which 23 lineages subsequently diverged. This study provides a better understanding of influenza NA lineages and their evolutionary dynamics, which may facilitate early detection of newly emerging influenza viruses and thus improve influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on evolutionary history and phylogenetics of neuraminidase genes without explicit links to viral phenotypes.

Title: Tenacity of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses in different types of poultry litter.
Abstract: To determine the risk of infection associated with exposure to low-pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus-contaminated poultry litter, the tenacity of low pathogenic A/Ck/CA/431/00(H6N2), A/Mallard/MN/355779/00(H5N2), and A/turkey/Ohio/313053/04(H3N2) was evaluated. Viral stocks were incubated with poultry litter from commercial flocks at 25°C. Three types of poultry litter, wood shavings, shavings plus gypsum, and shavings plus peanut hulls, from commercial broiler flocks were used. The 3 low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses retained infectivity for one day in wood shavings and shavings plus peanut hulls litter types, whereas in wood shavings plus gypsum, litter viruses remained infective for up to 3 d. In contrast to the survivability in litter, all the viruses maintained infectivity in water for 4 d at titers of log(10)4.5. The infectivity of A/Ck/CA/431/00(H6N2) shed by experimentally infected layers, broilers, and turkeys was retained for one day, independently of the type of litter. In commercial production where a high density of birds are housed, the viral load shed by an infected flock will be significantly higher than the viral load shed 3 d postinfection obtained under the experimental conditions used in this study. Therefore proper management and disposal of poultry by products, such as windrow composting of litter and the composting of carcasses during an AI outbreak should be implemented.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines virus survival in poultry litter, which relates to environmental stability rather than direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Global transmission of influenza viruses from humans to swine.
Abstract: To determine the extent to which influenza viruses jump between human and swine hosts, we undertook a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of pandemic A/H1N1/09 (H1N1pdm09) influenza virus genome sequence data. From this, we identified at least 49 human-to-swine transmission events that occurred globally during 2009-2011, thereby highlighting the ability of the H1N1pdm09 virus to transmit repeatedly from humans to swine, even following adaptive evolution in humans. Similarly, we identified at least 23 separate introductions of human seasonal (non-pandemic) H1 and H3 influenza viruses into swine globally since 1990. Overall, these results reveal the frequency with which swine are exposed to human influenza viruses, indicate that humans make a substantial contribution to the genetic diversity of influenza viruses in swine, and emphasize the need to improve biosecurity measures at the human-swine interface, including influenza vaccination of swine workers.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports on transmission events and phylogenetic analysis of influenza viruses between humans and swine, without explicit genotype-phenotype functional analysis.

Title: Contribution of the Portuguese Laboratory Network for the Diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2009/10 and 2010/11 influenza seasons.
Abstract: This article describes the data obtained by the Portuguese Laboratory Network, reactivated following the World Health Organization declaration of the 2009 influenza pandemic, on the diagnoses of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the pandemic (2009/10) and post-pandemic (2010/11) influenza seasons. The laboratories analysed and reported cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory, which performed more detailed antigenic and genetic characterisation of the virus isolates. In 2009/10, a total of 62,089 ILI cases, distributed in two peaks, were analysed, 25,985 of which were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Children aged 5–14 years were the most affected. Viruses were both antigenically and genetically similar to the pandemic strain A/California/7/2009, included in the 2009/10 pandemic vaccine. During the post-pandemic season, 1,496 ILI cases were tested for influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 572 of which were positive. Infection was mainly diagnosed in adolescent and adults. Although the 2010/11 viruses remained antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009, increased genetic variation was observed. During the two seasons, two viruses with the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, associated with oseltamivir resistance, were detected. The Laboratory Network made an important contribution to the description of the influenza activity in the two seasons.

Title: Comprehensive global amino acid sequence analysis of PB1F2 protein of influenza A H5N1 viruses and the influenza A virus subtypes responsible for the 20th-century pandemics.
Abstract: PB1F2 is the 11th protein of influenza A virus translated from +1 alternate reading frame of PB1 gene. Since the discovery, varying sizes and functions of the PB1F2 protein of influenza A viruses have been reported. Selection of PB1 gene segment in the pandemics, variable size and pleiotropic effect of PB1F2 intrigued us to analyze amino acid sequences of this protein in various influenza A viruses. Amino acid sequences for PB1F2 protein of influenza A H5N1, H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes were obtained from Influenza Research Database. Multiple sequence alignments of the PB1F2 protein sequences of the aforementioned subtypes were used to determine the size, variable and conserved domains and to perform mutational analysis. Analysis showed that 96·4% of the H5N1 influenza viruses harbored full-length PB1F2 protein. Except for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, all the subtypes of the 20th-century pandemic influenza viruses contained full-length PB1F2 protein. Through the years, PB1F2 protein of the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses has undergone much variation. PB1F2 protein sequences of H5N1 viruses showed both human- and avian host-specific conserved domains. Global database of PB1F2 protein revealed that N66S mutation was present only in 3·8% of the H5N1 strains. We found a novel mutation, N84S in the PB1F2 protein of 9·35% of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 influenza viruses. Varying sizes and mutations of the PB1F2 protein in different influenza A virus subtypes with pandemic potential were obtained. There was genetic divergence of the protein in various hosts which highlighted the host-specific evolution of the virus. However, studies are required to correlate this sequence variability with the virulence and pathogenicity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes amino acid sequence variation of PB1F2 protein across influenza subtypes but does not explicitly link these variations to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Intracytoplasmic trapping of influenza virus by a lipophilic derivative of aglycoristocetin.
Abstract: We report on a new anti-influenza virus agent, SA-19, a lipophilic glycopeptide derivative consisting of aglycoristocetin coupled to a phenylbenzyl-substituted cyclobutenedione. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B virus, SA-19 displayed a 50% antivirally effective concentration of 0.60 μM and a selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic versus antiviral concentration) of 112. SA-19 was 11-fold more potent than unsubstituted aglycoristocetin and was active in human and nonhuman cell lines. Virus yield at 72 h p.i. was reduced by 3.6 logs at 0.8 μM SA-19. In contrast to amantadine and oseltamivir, SA-19 did not select for resistance upon prolonged virus exposure. SA-19 was shown to inhibit an early postbinding step in virus replication. The compound had no effect on hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated membrane fusion in an HA-polykaryon assay and did not inhibit the low-pH-induced refolding of the HA in a tryptic digestion assay. However, a marked inhibitory effect on the transduction exerted by retroviral pseudoparticles carrying an HA or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) fusion protein was noted, suggesting that SA-19 targets a cellular factor with a role in influenza virus and VSV entry. Using confocal microscopy with antinucleoprotein staining, SA-19 was proven to completely prevent the influenza virus nuclear entry. This virus arrest was characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. SA-19 appeared to disturb the endocytic uptake and trap the influenza virus in vesicles distinct from early, late, or recycling endosomes. The aglycoristocetin derivative SA-19 represents a new class of potent and broad-acting influenza virus inhibitors with potential clinical relevance.

Title: Characterization of a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line for influenza virus production.
Abstract: We have developed a porcine intestine epithelial cell line, designated SD-PJEC for the propagation of influenza viruses. The SD-PJEC cell line is a subclone of the IPEC-J2 cell line, which was originally derived from newborn piglet jejunum. Our results demonstrate that SD-PJEC is a cell line of epithelial origin that preferentially expresses receptors of oligosaccharides with Sia2-6Gal modification. This cell line is permissive to infection with human and swine influenza A viruses and some avian influenza viruses, but poorly support the growth of human-origin influenza B viruses. Propagation of swine-origin influenza viruses in these cells results in a rapid growth rate within the first 24 h post-infection and the titres ranged from 4 to 8 log(10) TCID(50) ml(-1). The SD-PJEC cell line was further tested as a potential alternative cell line to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in conjunction with 293T cells for rescue of swine-origin influenza viruses using the reverse genetics system. The recombinant viruses A/swine/North Carolina/18161/02 (H1N1) and A/swine/Texas/4199-2/98 (H3N2) were rescued with virus titres of 7 and 8.25 log(10) TCID(50) ml(-1), respectively. The availability of this swine-specific cell line represents a more relevant substrate for studies and growth of swine-origin influenza viruses.

Abstract: We report here the complete genomic sequence of an H7N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolate, which was obtained from duck in 1996. This is the first report of this subtype of AIV being isolated from duck in Guangdong of Southern China. Genomic sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that it was highly homologous with the wild bird virus A/ruddy turnstone/Delaware Bay/135/1996 (H7N3) and that all eight genes of this virus belonged to the North America gene pool. The availability of genome sequences is helpful to further investigations of epidemiology and evolution of AIV between waterfowl and wild birds.

Title: Cell-free production of trimeric influenza hemagglutinin head domain proteins as vaccine antigens.
Abstract: In order to effectively combat pandemic influenza threats, there is a need for more rapid and robust vaccine production methods. In this article, we demonstrate E. coli-based cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) as a method to rapidly produce domains from the protein hemagglutinin (HA), which is present on the surface of the influenza virus. The portion of the HA coding sequence for the "head" domain from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was first optimized for E. coli expression. The protein domain was then produced in CFPS reactions and purified in soluble form first as a monomer and then as a trimer by a C-terminal addition of the T4 bacteriophage foldon domain. Production of soluble trimeric HA head domain was enhanced by introducing stabilizing amino acid mutations to the construct in order to avoid aggregation. Trimerization was verified using size exclusion HPLC, and the stabilized HA head domain trimer was more effectively recognized by antibodies from pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine recipients than was the monomer and also bound to sialic acids more strongly, indicating that the trimers are correctly formed and could be potentially effective as vaccines.

Title: Evolution, safety, and highly pathogenic influenza viruses.
Abstract: Experience with influenza has shown that predictions of virus phenotype or fitness from nucleotide sequence are imperfect and that predicting the timing and course of evolution is extremely difficult. Such uncertainty means that the risk of experiments with mammalian-transmissible, possibly highly virulent influenza viruses remains high even if some aspects of their laboratory biology are reassuring; it also implies limitations on the ability of laboratory observations to guide interpretation of surveillance of strains in the field. Thus, we propose that future experiments with virulent pathogens whose accidental or deliberate release could lead to extensive spread in human populations should be limited by explicit risk-benefit considerations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses challenges in predicting influenza virus phenotype from nucleotide sequence and the risks of experiments with transmissible viruses, focusing on risk assessment rather than explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Benefits and risks of influenza research: lessons learned.
Abstract: Given the yearly challenge of seasonal influenza and the potential catastrophic consequences of future pandemics, the need for intensive basic and clinical influenza research is unquestionable. Although the fruits of decades of research have enabled dramatic improvements in our ability to prevent and treat influenza, many fundamental questions remain, including those related to the complex factors associated with host switching and transmission of influenza viruses. Recent public concern over two H5N1 influenza manuscripts that studied the transmissibility of influenza viruses has triggered intense discussion on dual-use research and the way forward.

No consensus has developed yet about how to balance these concerns. After not recommending immediate full publication of earlier, less complete versions of the studies, the United States National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity subsequently recommended full publication of more complete manuscripts; however, controversy about this and similar research remains.

Title: Genetic evolution of the neuraminidase of influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2009 and its correspondence to haemagglutinin evolution.
Abstract: Each year, influenza viruses cause epidemics by evading pre-existing humoral immunity through mutations in the major glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). In 2004, the antigenic evolution of HA of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses was mapped (Smith et al., Science 305, 371-376, 2004) from its introduction in humans in 1968 until 2003. The current study focused on the genetic evolution of NA and compared it with HA using the dataset of Smith and colleagues, updated to the epidemic of the 2009/2010 season. Phylogenetic trees and genetic maps were constructed to visualize the genetic evolution of NA and HA. The results revealed multiple reassortment events over the years. Overall rates of evolutionary change were lower for NA than for HA1 at the nucleotide level. Selection pressures were estimated, revealing an abundance of negatively selected sites and sparse positively selected sites. The differences found between the evolution of NA and HA1 warrant further analysis of the evolution of NA at the phenotypic level, as has been done previously for HA.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic evolution and phylogenetics of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin without explicit experimental linkage to phenotypic traits.

Title: A comparative study of short linear motif compositions of the influenza A virus ribonucleoproteins.
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions through short linear motifs (SLiMs) are an emerging concept that is different from interactions between globular domains. The SLiMs encode a functional interaction interface in a short (three to ten residues) poorly conserved sequence. This characteristic makes them much more likely to arise/disappear spontaneously via mutations, and they may be more evolutionarily labile than globular domains. The diversity of SLiM composition may provide functional diversity for a viral protein from different viral strains. This study is designed to determine the different SLiM compositions of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) from influenza A viruses (IAVs) from different hosts and with different levels of virulence. The 96 consensus sequences (regular expressions) of SLiMs from the ELM server were used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the 52,513 IAV RNP sequences. The SLiM compositions of RNPs from IAVs from different hosts and with different levels of virulence were compared. The SLiM compositions of 845 RNPs from highly virulent/pandemic IAVs were also analyzed. In total, 292 highly conserved SLiMs were found in RNPs regardless of the IAV host range. These SLiMs may be basic motifs that are essential for the normal functions of RNPs. Moreover, several SLiMs that are rare in seasonal IAV RNPs but are present in RNPs from highly virulent/pandemic IAVs were identified.The SLiMs identified in this study provide a useful resource for experimental virologists to study the interactions between IAV RNPs and host intracellular proteins. Moreover, the SLiM compositions of IAV RNPs also provide insights into signal transduction pathways and protein interaction networks with which IAV RNPs might be involved. Information about SLiMs might be useful for the development of anti-IAV drugs.

Title: HMGB1 protein binds to influenza virus nucleoprotein and promotes viral replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus has evolved replication strategies that hijack host cell pathways. To uncover interactions between viral macromolecules and host proteins, we applied a phage display strategy. A library of human cDNA expression products displayed on filamentous phages was submitted to affinity selection for influenza viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). High-mobility-group box (HMGB) proteins were found to bind to the nucleoprotein (NP) component of vRNPs. HMGB1 and HMGB2 bind directly to the purified NP in the absence of viral RNA, and the HMG box A domain is sufficient to bind the NP. We show that HMGB1 associates with the viral NP in the nuclei of infected cells, promotes viral growth, and enhances the activity of the viral polymerase. The presence of a functional HMGB1 DNA-binding site is required to enhance influenza virus replication. Glycyrrhizin, which reduces HMGB1 binding to DNA, inhibits influenza virus polymerase activity. Our data show that the HMGB1 protein can play a significant role in intranuclear replication of influenza viruses, thus extending previous findings on the bornavirus and on a number of DNA viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host protein interactions with viral nucleoprotein and effects on replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Response of primary human airway epithelial cells to influenza infection: a quantitative proteomic study.
Abstract: Influenza A virus exerts a large health burden during both yearly epidemics and global pandemics. However, designing effective vaccine and treatment options has proven difficult since the virus evolves rapidly. Therefore, it may be beneficial to identify host proteins associated with viral infection and replication to establish potential new antiviral targets. We have previously measured host protein responses in continuously cultured A549 cells infected with mouse-adapted virus strain A/PR/8/34(H1N1; PR8). We here identify and measure host proteins differentially regulated in more relevant primary human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cells. A total of 3740 cytosolic HBAE proteins were identified by 2D LC-MS/MS, of which 52 were up-regulated ≥2-fold and 41 were down-regulated ≥2-fold after PR8 infection. Up-regulated HBAE proteins clustered primarily into interferon signaling, other host defense processes, and molecular transport, whereas down-regulated proteins were associated with cell death signaling pathways, cell adhesion and motility, and lipid metabolism. Comparison to influenza-infected A549 cells indicated some common influenza-induced host cell alterations, including defense response, molecular transport proteins, and cell adhesion. However, HBAE-specific alterations consisted of interferon and cell death signaling. These data point to important differences between influenza replication in continuous and primary cell lines and/or alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells.

Title: Comparisons of oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) and concurrent oseltamivir-susceptible seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus infections in hospitalized adults, 2008-2009.
Abstract: In an observational cohort study, we found that adults hospitalized for oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) seasonal H1N1 influenza (n = 46) were older than those infected with oseltamivir-susceptible strains (n = 31) [74(IQR 59-83) versus 64(IQR 48-76) years; P = 0·045], and most had major comorbidities (78% versus 65%). Disease severity and clinical outcomes were comparable between the two groups: radiographic pneumonia 40-42%, supplemental oxygen use 47-48%, critical illness 11-13%, median duration of hospitalization 5-6 days, death rate 6-9%. Failure to receive effective antiviral therapy was associated with progression to critical illness (23% versus 0%, P = 0·016) and death (20% versus 0%, P = 0·033) in hospitalized patients with seasonal H1N1 influenza.

Title: The molecular mechanism of action of the CR6261-Azichromycin combination found through computational analysis.
Abstract: CR6261 was found in 2008 and F10 was found in 2009. In 2010 Friesen et al experimentally showed that Oseltamivir/Zanamivir may improve the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261. As a result, the use of CR6261 combined with a drug to provide an antibody-based therapy against all influenza A viruses was proposed. Although CR8020 may neutralize group 2 influenza viruses and FI6 may neutralize both group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses as determined in 2011, the insight of Friesen et al is still interesting. Here, we address the following questions: how to uncover the molecular mechanism of a drug, which improves the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs and how to find drugs that enable CR6261 (CR8020, F10) to become a universal mAb. Using the 3D structures of 3 gbn, 3 gbm, 3 ztn, 3 ztj, 3 fku and 3 sdy, we separate the 3D structures of CR6261, F10, CR8020 and FI6, and the 3D structures of trimer HAs of H3N2 and H5N1. Based on the experimental result of Friesen et al, we have found many clues, which reveal the molecular mechanism of action for a drug and an HA-mAb complex. Oseltamivir/Zanamivir may congruously improve the therapeutic efficacies of CR6261, F10, CR8020 and FI6 by providing an additional affinity to compensate for the loss of affinity between HA and mAb resulting from mutations. However, Oseltamivir or Zanamivir are not expected to generally widen the spectrum of these mAbs. In order to enhance CR6261, CR8020, or for F10 to become universal, we may select Azichromycin, Oseltamivir, or the combination of Azichromycin and Oseltamivir, respectively.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses computational analysis to explore molecular mechanisms of drug and antibody interactions but does not experimentally link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The 3' splice site of influenza A segment 7 mRNA can exist in two conformations: a pseudoknot and a hairpin.
Abstract: The 3' splice site of influenza A segment 7 is used to produce mRNA for the M2 ion-channel protein, which is critical to the formation of viable influenza virions. Native gel analysis, enzymatic/chemical structure probing, and oligonucleotide binding studies of a 63 nt fragment, containing the 3' splice site, key residues of an SF2/ASF splicing factor binding site, and a polypyrimidine tract, provide evidence for an equilibrium between pseudoknot and hairpin structures. This equilibrium is sensitive to multivalent cations, and can be forced towards the pseudoknot by addition of 5 mM cobalt hexammine. In the two conformations, the splice site and other functional elements exist in very different structural environments. In particular, the splice site is sequestered in the middle of a double helix in the pseudoknot conformation, while in the hairpin it resides in a two-by-two nucleotide internal loop. The results suggest that segment 7 mRNA splicing can be controlled by a conformational switch that exposes or hides the splice site.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on RNA structural conformations affecting splicing, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Postinfection A77-1726 treatment improves cardiopulmonary function in H1N1 influenza-infected mice.
Abstract: Acute respiratory disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in influenza. Because antiviral drugs are only effective early in infection, new agents are needed to treat nonvaccinated patients presenting with late-stage disease, particularly those who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. We found previously that the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor A77-1726 reversed the influenza-induced impairment of alveolar fluid clearance. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and intact alveolar fluid clearance demonstrate lower mortality than those with compromised fluid clearance. We therefore investigated the effects of treatment with nebulized A77-1726 (67.5 mg/kg) on indices of cardiopulmonary function relevant to the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. BALB/cAnNCr mice (8-12 wk old) were inoculated intranasally with 10,000 plaque-forming units/mouse influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Pulse oximetry was performed daily. Alveolar fluid clearance, lung water, and lung mechanics were measured at 2 and 6 days after inoculation in live, ventilated mice by BSA instillation, magnetic resonance imaging, and forced-oscillation techniques, respectively. A77-1726 treatment at 1 day after inoculation delayed mortality. Treatment on Days 1 or 5 reduced viral replication on Day 6, and improved alveolar fluid clearance, peripheral oxygenation, and cardiac function. Nebulized A77-1726 also reversed influenza-induced increases in lung water content and volume, improved pulmonary mechanics, reduced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ATP and neutrophil content, and increased IL-6 concentrations. The ability of A77-1726 to improve cardiopulmonary function in influenza-infected mice and to reduce the severity of ongoing acute respiratory distress syndrome late in infection suggests that pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors are promising therapeutic candidates for the management of severe influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates a treatment's effect on cardiopulmonary function in infected mice but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, 2011-12 season and composition of the 2012-13 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2011-12 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity* occurred at low levels during October through December and increased in January and February before peaking in mid-March. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated overall, but influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) and influenza B viruses also circulated widely. This influenza season was mild compared with recent years, with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI),† lower rates of hospitalizations, and fewer deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2011-12 influenza season (October 2, 2011-May 19, 2012) and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2012-13 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: MicroRNA regulation of human protease genes essential for influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics threatening the health of millions of people each year. Vaccination is an effective strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality, and in the absence of drug resistance, the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis is comparable to that of vaccines. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance has emphasized the need for new drug targets. Knowledge of the host cell components required for influenza replication has been an area targeted for disease intervention. In this study, the human protease genes required for influenza virus replication were determined and validated using RNA interference approaches. The genes validated as critical for influenza virus replication were ADAMTS7, CPE, DPP3, MST1, and PRSS12, and pathway analysis showed these genes were in global host cell pathways governing inflammation (NF-κB), cAMP/calcium signaling (CRE/CREB), and apoptosis. Analyses of host microRNAs predicted to govern expression of these genes showed that eight miRNAs regulated gene expression during virus replication. These findings identify unique host genes and microRNAs important for influenza replication providing potential new targets for disease intervention strategies.

Reason: The paper focuses on host microRNA regulation of human protease genes essential for influenza replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection among 2009 Hajj Pilgrims from Southern Iran: a real-time RT-PCR-based study.
Abstract: Hajj is a mass gathering undertaken annually in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The 2009 Hajj coincided with both the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) and seasonal types of influenza A viruses. The interaction between pandemic influenza and Hajj could cause both a high level of mortality among the pilgrims and the spread of infection in their respective countries upon their return home. The present study attempted to determine the point prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 among returning Iranian pilgrims, most of whom had been vaccinated for seasonal influenza but not A(H1N1)pdm09. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 305 pilgrims arriving at the airport in Shiraz, Iran. RNA was extracted from the samples and A(H1N1)pdm09 and other seasonal influenza A viruses were detected using TaqMan real-time PCR. For A(H1N1)pdm09-positive samples, the sensitivity to oseltamivir was also evaluated. Subjects included 132 (43.3%) men and 173 (56.7%) women, ranging in age from 24 to 65 years. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in five (1.6%) pilgrims and other influenza A viruses in eight (2.6%). All the A(H1N1)pdm09 were sensitive to oseltamivir. Only five cases were found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09, and it seems unlikely that the arrival of infected pilgrims to their homelands would cause an outbreak of a new wave of infection there. Thus, the low morbidity and mortality rates among the pilgrims could be attributed to the characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09, which causes morbidity and mortality in a way similar to the seasonal influenza infections, absence of high-risk individuals among the Iranian pilgrims, and the instructions given to them about contact and hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports prevalence of pandemic H1N1 infection among pilgrims and antiviral sensitivity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Oncolytic effects of a novel influenza A virus expressing interleukin-15 from the NS reading frame.
Abstract: Oncolytic influenza A viruses with deleted NS1 gene (delNS1) replicate selectively in tumour cells with defective interferon response and/or activated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. To develop a delNS1 virus with specific immunostimulatory properties, we used an optimised technology to insert the interleukin-15 (IL-15) coding sequence into the viral NS gene segment (delNS1-IL-15). DelNS1 and delNS1-IL-15 exerted similar oncolytic effects. Both viruses replicated and caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in interferon-defective melanoma cells. Virus replication was required for their oncolytic activity. Cisplatin enhanced the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses. The cytotoxic drug increased delNS1 replication and delNS1-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Interference with MEK/ERK signalling by RNAi-mediated depletion or the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not affect the oncolytic effects of the delNS1 viruses. In oncolysis sensitive melanoma cells, delNS1-IL-15 (but not delNS1) infection resulted in the production of IL-15 levels ranging from 70 to 1140 pg/mL in the cell culture supernatants. The supernatants of delNS1-IL-15-infected (but not of delNS1-infected) melanoma cells induced primary human natural killer cell-mediated lysis of non-infected tumour cells. In conclusion, we constructed a novel oncolytic influenza virus that combines the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses with immunostimulatory properties through production of functional IL-15. Moreover, we showed that the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses can be enhanced in combination with cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on oncolytic influenza viruses engineered to express IL-15 and their effects on tumor cells, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: One influenza virus particle packages eight unique viral RNAs as shown by FISH analysis.
Abstract: Influenza A virus possesses a segmented genome of eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNAs. The eight segments have been shown to be represented in approximately equal molar ratios in a virus population; however, the exact copy number of each viral RNA segment per individual virus particles has not been determined. We have established an experimental approach based on multicolor single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to study the composition of viral RNAs at single-virus particle resolution. Colocalization analysis showed that a high percentage of virus particles package all eight different segments of viral RNAs. To determine the copy number of each RNA segment within individual virus particles, we measured the photobleaching steps of individual virus particles hybridized with fluorescent probes targeting a specific viral RNA. By comparing the photobleaching profiles of probes against the HA RNA segment for the wild-type influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and a recombinant PR8 virus carrying two copies of the HA segment, we concluded that only one copy of HA segment is packaged into a wild type virus particle. Our results showed similar photobleaching behaviors for other RNA segments, suggesting that for the majority of the virus particles, only one copy of each RNA segment is packaged into one virus particle. Together, our results support that the packaging of influenza viral genome is a selective process.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on viral RNA packaging in influenza virus particles without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The effect of rosuvastatin in a murine model of influenza A infection.
Abstract: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as rosuvastatin may have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce the severity of influenza A infection. We hypothesized that rosuvastatin would decrease viral replication, attenuate lung injury, and improve mortality following influenza A infection in mice. C57Bl/6 mice were treated daily with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) supplemented in chow (or control chow) beginning three days prior to infection with either A//Udorn/72 [H3N2] or A/WSN/33 [H1N1] influenza A virus (1×10(5) pfu/mouse). Plaque assays were used to examine the effect of rosuvastatin on viral replication in vitro and in the lungs of infected mice. We measured cell count with differential, protein and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, histologic evidence of lung injury, and wet-to-dry ratio on Day 1, 2, 4, and 6. We also recorded daily weights and mortality. The administration of rosuvastatin had no effect on viral clearance of influenza A after infection. Weight loss, lung inflammation and lung injury severity were similar in the rosuvastatin and control treated mice. In the mice infected with influenza A (A/WSN/33), mortality was unaffected by treatment with rosuvastatin. Statins did not alter the replication of influenza A in vitro or enhance its clearance from the lung in vivo. Statins neither attenuated the severity of influenza A-induced lung injury nor had an effect on influenza A-related mortality. Our data suggest that the association between HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and improved outcomes in patients with sepsis and pneumonia are not attributable to their effects on influenza A infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the effect of rosuvastatin on influenza infection in mice without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Differentiated swine airway epithelial cell cultures for the investigation of influenza A virus infection and replication.
Abstract: Differentiated human airway epithelial cell cultures have been utilized to investigate cystic fibrosis, wound healing, and characteristics of viral infections. These cultures, grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) in media with defined hormones and growth factors, recapitulate many aspects of the in vivo respiratory tract and allow for experimental studies at the cellular level. To optimize growth conditions for differentiated swine airway epithelial cultures and to use these cultures to examine influenza virus infection and replication. Primary swine respiratory epithelial cells were grown at an air-liquid interface with varying amounts of retinoic acid and epidermal growth factor. Cells grown with optimized concentrations of these factors for 4 weeks differentiated into multilayer epithelial cell cultures resembling the lining of the swine respiratory tract. Influenza virus infection and replication were examined in these cultures. Retinoic acid promoted ciliogenesis, whereas epidermal growth factor controlled the thickness of the pseudoepithelium. The optimal concentrations for differentiated swine cell cultures were 1·5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 100nm retinoic acid. Influenza A viruses infected and productively replicated in these cultures in the absence of exogenous trypsin, suggesting that the cultures express a protease capable of activating influenza virus hemagglutinin. Differences in virus infection and replication characteristics found previously in pigs in vivo were recapitulated in the swine cultures. This system could be a useful tool for a range of applications, including investigating influenza virus species specificity, defining cell tropism of influenza viruses in the swine respiratory epithelium, and studying other swine respiratory diseases.

Title: Heterologous RNA-silencing suppressors from both plant- and animal-infecting viruses support plum pox virus infection.
Abstract: HCPro, the RNA-silencing suppressor (RSS) of viruses belonging to the genus Potyvirus in the family Potyviridae, is a multifunctional protein presumably involved in all essential steps of the viral infection cycle. Recent studies have shown that plum pox potyvirus (PPV) HCPro can be replaced successfully by cucumber vein yellowing ipomovirus P1b, a sequence-unrelated RSS from a virus of the same family. In order to gain insight into the requirement of a particular RSS to establish a successful potyviral infection, we tested the ability of different heterologous RSSs from both plant- and animal-infecting viruses to substitute for HCPro. Making use of engineered PPV chimeras, we show that PPV HCPro can be replaced functionally by some, but not all, unrelated RSSs, including the NS1 protein of the mammal-infecting influenza A virus. Interestingly, the capacity of a particular RSS to replace HCPro does not correlate strictly with its RNA silencing-suppression strength. Altogether, our results suggest that not all suppression strategies are equally suitable for efficient escape of PPV from the RNA-silencing machinery. The approach followed here, based on using PPV chimeras in which an under-consideration RSS substitutes for HCPro, could further help to study the function of diverse RSSs in a 'highly sensitive' RNA-silencing context, such as that taking place in plant cells during the process of a viral infection.

Title: Matrix metalloprotease 9 mediates neutrophil migration into the airways in response to influenza virus-induced toll-like receptor signaling.
Abstract: The early inflammatory response to influenza virus infection contributes to severe lung disease and continues to pose a serious threat to human health. The mechanisms by which neutrophils gain entry to the respiratory tract and their role during pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we report that neutrophils significantly contributed to morbidity in a pathological mouse model of influenza virus infection. Using extensive immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transfers, and depletion studies, we identified neutrophils as the predominant pulmonary cellular source of the gelatinase matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9, which is capable of digesting the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, infection of MMP9-deficient mice showed that MMP9 was functionally required for neutrophil migration and control of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Although MMP9 release was toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling-dependent, MyD88-mediated signals in non-hematopoietic cells, rather than neutrophil TLRs themselves, were important for neutrophil migration. These results were extended using multiplex analyses of inflammatory mediators to show that neutrophil chemotactic factor, CCL3, and TNFα were reduced in the Myd88⁻/⁻ airways. Furthermore, TNFα induced MMP9 secretion by neutrophils and blocking TNFα in vivo reduced neutrophil recruitment after infection. Innate recognition of influenza virus therefore provides the mechanisms to induce recruitment of neutrophils through chemokines and to enable their motility within the tissue via MMP9-mediated cleavage of the basement membrane. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown contribution of MMP9 to influenza virus pathogenesis by mediating excessive neutrophil migration into the respiratory tract in response to viral replication that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on host immune response mechanisms (MMP9 and neutrophil migration) during influenza infection without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza a viruses from wild birds in Guatemala belong to the North American lineage.
Abstract: The role wild bird species play in the transmission and ecology of avian influenza virus (AIV) is well established; however, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the worldwide distribution of these viruses, specifically about the prevalence and/or significance of AIV in Central and South America. As part of an assessment of the ecology of AIV in Guatemala, we conducted active surveillance in wild birds on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Cloacal and tracheal swab samples taken from resident and migratory wild birds were collected from February 2007 to January 2010.1913 samples were collected and virus was detected by real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) in 28 swab samples from ducks (Anas discors). Virus isolation was attempted for these positive samples, and 15 isolates were obtained from the migratory duck species Blue-winged teal. The subtypes identified included H7N9, H11N2, H3N8, H5N3, H8N4, and H5N4. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral sequences revealed that AIV isolates are highly similar to viruses from the North American lineage suggesting that bird migration dictates the ecology of these viruses in the Guatemalan bird population.

Title: Abortive replication of influenza virus in mouse dendritic cells.
Abstract: The interaction between influenza virus and dendritic cells (DCs) remains poorly defined and controversial. Here we show that influenza virus replication in mouse bone marrow-derived DCs is abortive, despite viral genome transcription and replication occurring for each gene segment and viral hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, at least, being produced. Electron microscopy reveals that virus assembly, rather than release of virus from the cell surface, is defective.

Title: An open-label phase I trial of a live attenuated H2N2 influenza virus vaccine in healthy adults.
Abstract: Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) against a variety of strains of pandemic potential are being developed and tested. We describe the results of an open-label phase I trial of a live attenuated H2N2 virus vaccine. To evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated H2N2 influenza virus vaccine. The A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) virus used in this study is the attenuated, cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive strain that provides the genetic backbone of seasonal LAIV (MedImmune). We evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of 10(7) TCID(50) of this vaccine administered by nasal spray 4 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adults. Twenty-one participants received a first dose of the vaccine; 18 participants received a second dose. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. The most common adverse events after vaccination were headache and musculoskeletal pain. The vaccine was restricted in replication: 24% and 17% had virus detectable by culture or rRT-PCR after the first and second dose, respectively. Antibody responses to the vaccine were also restricted: 24% of participants developed an antibody response as measured by either hemagglutination-inhibition assay (10%), or ELISA for H2 HA-specific serum IgG (24%) or IgA (16%) after either one or two doses. None of the participants had a neutralizing antibody response. Vaccine-specific IgG-secreting cells as measured by enzyme-linked immunospot increased from a mean of 0·5 to 2·0/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); vaccine-specific IgA-secreting cells increased from 0·1 to 0·5/10(6) PBMCs. The live attenuated H2N2 1960 AA ca vaccine demonstrated a safety profile consistent with seasonal trivalent LAIV but was restricted in replication and minimally immunogenic in healthy seronegative adults.

Title: Influenza virus respiratory infection and transmission following ocular inoculation in ferrets.
Abstract: While influenza viruses are a common respiratory pathogen, sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract. The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection. However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood. Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route. We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection. H5N1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route. Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues. Despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, virus transmissibility to naïve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation. These data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes.

Reason: The study describes infection and transmission following ocular inoculation in ferrets but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of influenza A virus replication by antagonism of a PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway member identified by gene-trap insertional mutagenesis.
Abstract: Host genes serving potential roles in virus replication may be exploited as novel antiviral targets. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of host gene expression was used to validate candidate genes in screens against six unrelated viruses, most importantly influenza. A mouse model of influenza A virus infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of a candidate FDA-approved drug identified in the screening effort. Several genes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were found to support broad-spectrum viral replication in vitro by RNA interference. This led to the discovery that everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, showed in vitro antiviral activity against cowpox, dengue type 2, influenza A, rhino- and respiratory syncytial viruses. In a lethal mouse infection model of influenza A (H1N1 and H5N1) virus infection, everolimus treatment (1 mg/kg/day) significantly delayed death but could not prevent mortality. Fourteen days of treatment was more beneficial in delaying the time to death than treatment for seven days. Pathological findings in everolimus-treated mice showed reduced lung haemorrhage and lung weights in response to infection. These results provide proof of concept that cellular targets can be identified by gene knockout methods, and highlight the importance of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in supporting viral infections.

Title: Avian influenza (H5N1) virus of clade 2.3.2 in domestic poultry in India.
Abstract: South Asia has experienced regular outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza virus since its first detection in India and Pakistan in February, 2006. Till 2009, the outbreaks in this region were due to clade 2.2 H5N1 virus. In 2010, Nepal reported the first outbreak of clade 2.3.2 virus in South Asia. In February 2011, two outbreaks of H5N1 virus were reported in the State of Tripura in India. The antigenic and genetic analyses of seven H5N1 viruses isolated during these outbreaks were carried out. Antigenic analysis confirmed 64 to 256-fold reduction in cross reactivity compared with clade 2.2 viruses. The intravenous pathogenicity index of the isolates ranged from 2.80-2.95 indicating high pathogenicity to chickens. Sequencing of all the eight gene-segments of seven H5N1 viruses isolated in these outbreaks was carried out. The predicted amino acid sequence analysis revealed high pathogenicity to chickens and susceptibility to the antivirals, amantadine and oseltamivir. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these viruses belong to clade 2.3.2.1 and were distinct to the clade 2.3.2.1 viruses isolated in Nepal. Identification of new clade 2.3.2 H5N1 viruses in South Asia is reminiscent of the introduction of clade 2.2 viruses in this region in 2006/7. It is now important to monitor whether the clade 2.3.2.1 is replacing clade 2.2 in this region or co-circulating with it. Continued co-circulation of various subclades of the H5N1 virus which are more adapted to land based poultry in a highly populated region such as South Asia increases the risk of evolution of pandemic H5N1 strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic and antigenic characterization of H5N1 viruses and their phylogenetic clades but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Pre-clinical evaluation of a replication-competent recombinant adenovirus serotype 4 vaccine expressing influenza H5 hemagglutinin.
Abstract: Influenza virus remains a significant health and social concern in part because of newly emerging strains, such as avian H5N1 virus. We have developed a prototype H5N1 vaccine using a recombinant, replication-competent Adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) vector, derived from the U.S. military Ad4 vaccine strain, to express the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 influenza virus (Ad4-H5-Vtn). Our hypothesis is that a mucosally-delivered replicating Ad4-H5-Vtn recombinant vector will be safe and induce protective immunity against H5N1 influenza virus infection and disease pathogenesis. The Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine was designed with a partial deletion of the E3 region of Ad4 to accommodate the influenza HA gene. Replication and growth kinetics of the vaccine virus in multiple human cell lines indicated that the vaccine virus is attenuated relative to the wild type virus. Expression of the HA transgene in infected cells was documented by flow cytometry, western blot analysis and induction of HA-specific antibody and cellular immune responses in mice. Of particular note, mice immunized intranasally with the Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine were protected against lethal H5N1 reassortant viral challenge even in the presence of pre-existing immunity to the Ad4 wild type virus. Several non-clinical attributes of this vaccine including safety, induction of HA-specific humoral and cellular immunity, and efficacy were demonstrated using an animal model to support Phase 1 clinical trial evaluation of this new vaccine.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes vaccine development and immune responses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Decoding the distribution of glycan receptors for human-adapted influenza A viruses in ferret respiratory tract.
Abstract: Ferrets are widely used as animal models for studying influenza A viral pathogenesis and transmissibility. Human-adapted influenza A viruses primarily target the upper respiratory tract in humans (infection of the lower respiratory tract is observed less frequently), while in ferrets, upon intranasal inoculation both upper and lower respiratory tract are targeted. Viral tropism is governed by distribution of complex sialylated glycan receptors in various cells/tissues of the host that are specifically recognized by influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein on viral surface. It is generally known that upper respiratory tract of humans and ferrets predominantly express α2→6 sialylated glycan receptors. However much less is known about the fine structure of these glycan receptors and their distribution in different regions of the ferret respiratory tract. In this study, we characterize distribution of glycan receptors going beyond terminal sialic acid linkage in the cranial and caudal regions of the ferret trachea (upper respiratory tract) and lung hilar region (lower respiratory tract) by multiplexing use of various plant lectins and human-adapted HAs to stain these tissue sections. Our findings show that the sialylated glycan receptors recognized by human-adapted HAs are predominantly distributed in submucosal gland of lung hilar region as a part of O-linked glycans. Our study has implications in understanding influenza A viral pathogenesis in ferrets and also in employing ferrets as animal models for developing therapeutic strategies against influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes glycan receptor distribution in ferret respiratory tract but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza activity - United States, October 2, 2011-February 11, 2012.
Abstract: This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* since the beginning of the 2011-12 influenza season (October 2, 2011) and updates the previous report. From October through early January, influenza activity remained low throughout the United States. Activity increased slightly in early February 2012, but remains low. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses all have been identified thus far this influenza season, and the majority of viruses in circulation are antigenically similar to strains included in the 2011-12 vaccine.

Title: Characterization of the viral microbiome in patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections, using metagenomic sequencing.
Abstract: The human respiratory tract is heavily exposed to microorganisms. Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease. Furthermore, as viruses have limited means of transmission, viruses that cause pathogenicity in other tissues may be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is therefore important to chart the human virome in this compartment. We have studied nasopharyngeal aspirate samples submitted to the Karolinska University Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden from March 2004 to May 2005 for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses. Most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families; Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae or Orthomyxoviridae. The study also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C, and identified a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes the viral microbiome using metagenomics but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: In-Silico screening of Pleconaril and its novel substituted derivatives with Neuraminidase of H1N1 Influenza strain.
Abstract: Neuraminidase (NA) is a prominent surface antigen of Influenza viruses, which helps in release of viruses from the host cells after replication. Anti influenza drugs such as Oseltamivir target a highly conserved active site of NA, which comprises of 8 functional residues (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371 and Y406) to restrict viral release from host cells, thus inhibiting its ability to cleave sialic acid residues on the cell membrane. Reports on the emergence of Oseltamivir resistant strains of H1N1 Influenza virus necessitated a search for alternative drug candidates. Pleconaril is a novel antiviral drug being developed by Schering-Plough to treat Picornaviridae infections, and is in its late clinical trials stage. Since, Pleconaril was designed to bind the highly conserved hydrophobic binding site on VP1 protein of Picorna viruses, the ability of Pleconaril and its novel substituted derivatives to bind highly conserved hydrophobic active site of H1N1 Neuraminidase, targeting which oseltamivir has been designed was investigated. 310 novel substituted variants of Pleconaril were designed using Chemsketch software and docked into the highly conserved active site of NA using arguslab software. 198 out of 310 Pleconaril variants analyzed for docking with NA active site were proven effective, based on their free binding energy. Pleconaril variants with F, Cl, Br, CH3, OH and aromatic ring substitutions were shown to be effective alternatives to Oseltamivir as anti influenza drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on in-silico docking studies of Pleconaril derivatives with neuraminidase of H1N1, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Origin and fate of A/H1N1 influenza in Scotland during 2009.
Abstract: The spread of influenza has usually been described by a 'density' model, where the largest centres of population drive the epidemic within a country. An alternative model emphasizing the role of air travel has recently been developed. We have examined the relative importance of the two in the context of the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic in Scotland. We obtained genome sequences of 70 strains representative of the geographical and temporal distribution of H1N1 influenza during the summer and winter phases of the pandemic in 2009. We analysed these strains, together with another 128 from the rest of the UK and 292 globally distributed strains, using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic and bayesian phylogeographical methods. This revealed strikingly different epidemic patterns within Scotland in the early and late parts of 2009. The summer epidemic in Scotland was characterized by multiple independent introductions from both international and other UK sources, followed by major local expansion of a single clade that probably originated in Birmingham. The winter phase, in contrast, was more diverse genetically, with several clades of similar size in different locations, some of which had no particularly close phylogenetic affinity to strains sampled from either Scotland or England. Overall there was evidence to support both models, with significant links demonstrated between North American sequences and those from England, and between England and East Asia, indicating that major air-travel routes played an important role in the pattern of spread of the pandemic, both within the UK and globally.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes phylogenetic and phylogeographical patterns of H1N1 spread but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Inferring pandemic growth rates from sequence data.
Abstract: Using sequence data to infer population dynamics is playing an increasing role in the analysis of outbreaks. The most common methods in use, based on coalescent inference, have been widely used but not extensively tested against simulated epidemics. Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased. We illustrate this with an application to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on inferring epidemic growth rates from sequence data and methodological biases, without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: One-step detection of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus by the RT-SmartAmp assay and its clinical validation.
Abstract: In 2009, a pandemic (pdm) influenza A(H1N1) virus infection quickly circulated globally resulting in about 18,000 deaths around the world. In Japan, infected patients accounted for 16% of the total population. The possibility of human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic novel influenza viruses is becoming a fear for human health and society. To address the clinical need for rapid diagnosis, we have developed a new method, the "RT-SmartAmp assay", to rapidly detect the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus from patient swab samples. The RT-SmartAmp assay comprises both reverse transcriptase (RT) and isothermal DNA amplification reactions in one step, where RNA extraction and PCR reaction are not required. We used an exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent primer to specifically detect the HA segment of the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus within 40 minutes without cross-reacting with the seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), or B-type (Victoria) viruses. We evaluated the RT-SmartAmp method in clinical research carried out in Japan during a pandemic period of October 2009 to January 2010. A total of 255 swab samples were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness at three hospitals and eleven clinics located in the Tokyo and Chiba areas in Japan. The 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus was detected by the RT-SmartAmp assay, and the detection results were subsequently compared with data of current influenza diagnostic tests (lateral flow immuno-chromatographic tests) and viral genome sequence analysis. In conclusion, by the RT-SmartAmp assay we could detect the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus in patients' swab samples even in early stages after the initial onset of influenza symptoms. Thus, the RT-SmartAmp assay is considered to provide a simple and practical tool to rapidly detect the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus.

Title: Engineered H5N1: a rare time for restraint in science.
Abstract: Two scientific teams have recently engineered the H5N1 virus to make it readily transmissible between ferrets. Given that ferrets are considered the most reliable animal surrogate for human influenza infection, the newly engineered H5N1 strain is probably transmissible between humans as well. The potential consequences of an engineered human-transmissible H5N1 strain are stunning. Although seasonal flu infects as much as 20% of the world's population-more than 1 billion persons-each year, only a small fraction of those with seasonal flu dies, most often the oldest, youngest, and sickest. If the newly engineered strain were to escape the laboratory (either by design or by accident) and spread as widely as seasonal flu with anywhere near the current confirmed H5N1 human case-fatality rate, it could endanger the lives of hundreds of millions of persons. The possible benefits of this work do not justify taking such risks. As clinicians, we have a stake in this issue with our responsibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of influenza. We embrace the principle of free and open exchange of scientific information, but we also believe in the principle of "first, do no harm." These 2 principles have come into a moment of rare conflict. It seems most reasonable and prudent to request that the involved scientific community and its institutions exercise restraint by restricting dissemination of the experimental results and discontinuing work on the engineered H5N1 strains. If a highly compelling case is made for continued work on this strain despite the risks, the work should be controlled and should merit the greatest scrutiny.

Reason: This is a commentary on the risks of engineering transmissible H5N1 viruses, without presenting experimental genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Laboratory creation of a highly transmissible H5N1 influenza virus: balancing substantial risks and real benefits.
Abstract: Controversy erupted when influenza researchers announced that they had created an H5N1 influenza virus that was transmissible between ferrets. The controversy escalated when the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) recommended that the work be published but recommended significant voluntary redactions. The responses to the NSABB action and to the research itself have been polarized. A readily transmitted H5N1 virus could be extraordinarily lethal; therefore, the risk for accidental release is significant, and deliberate misuse of the data to create a biological weapon is possible. However, the knowledge gained by these and future experiments under appropriate safeguards is likely to allow critical understanding of influenza transmission and virulence. It would be irresponsible to adopt either extreme solution: to prevent and censor the research or to allow unlimited distribution without careful review by an independent group, such as the NSABB.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses creation of a transmissible H5N1 virus and the associated risks and benefits but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Three-dimensional analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes in influenza A virus.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA (vRNA) segments. Although genome segmentation provides advantages such as genetic reassortment, which contributes to the emergence of novel strains with pandemic potential, it complicates the genome packaging of progeny virions. Here we elucidate, using electron tomography, the three-dimensional structure of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) within progeny virions. Each virion is packed with eight well-organized RNPs that possess rod-like structures of different lengths. Multiple interactions are found among the RNPs. The position of the eight RNPs is not consistent among virions, but a pattern suggests the existence of a specific mechanism for assembly of these RNPs. Analyses of budding progeny virions suggest two independent roles for the viral spike proteins: RNP association on the plasma membrane and the subsequent formation of the virion shell. Our data provide further insights into the mechanisms responsible for segmented-genome packaging into virions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on structural analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes in influenza virions without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Dynamic patterns of circulating seasonal and pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses from 2007-2010 in and around Delhi, India.
Abstract: Influenza surveillance was carried out in a subset of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting at an Employee Health Clinic (EHS) at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi (urban) and pediatric out patients department of civil hospital at Ballabhgarh (peri-urban), under the Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project (CRHSP) of AIIMS, in Delhi region from January 2007 to December 2010. Of the 3264 samples tested, 541 (17%) were positive for influenza viruses, of which 221 (41%) were pandemic Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 168 (31%) were seasonal influenza A, and 152 (28%) were influenza B. While the Influenza viruses were detected year-round, their types/subtypes varied remarkably. While there was an equal distribution of seasonal A(H1N1) and influenza B in 2007, predominance of influenza B was observed in 2008. At the beginning of 2009, circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses was observed, followed later by emergence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with co-circulation of influenza B viruses. Influenza B was dominant subtype in early 2010, with second wave of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in August-September, 2010. With the exception of pandemic H1N1 emergence in 2009, the peaks of influenza activity coincided primarily with monsoon season, followed by minor peak in winter at both urban and rural sites. Age group analysis of influenza positivity revealed that the percent positivity of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was highest in >5-18 years age groups (OR 2.5; CI = 1.2-5.0; p = 0.009) when compared to seasonal influenza. Phylogenetic analysis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from urban and rural sites did not reveal any major divergence from other Indian strains or viruses circulating worldwide. Continued surveillance globally will help define regional differences in influenza seasonality, as well as, to determine optimal periods to implement influenza vaccination programs among priority populations.

Title: No evidence for intra-segment recombination of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in swine.
Abstract: Hao (2011) reported that the PB2 genes of three swine influenza A viruses were likely generated through homologous recombination between two closely related parental strains.

Through rigorous phylogenetic analyses we explain the evolutionary origins of these stains and confirm the lack of any statistical support for intra-segmental recombination.

Title: Human virus-specific effector-type T cells accumulate in blood but not in lymph nodes.
Abstract: It is believed that the size of the CD8(+) T-cell pool is fixed and that with every new viral challenge, the size of the pre-existing memory-cell population shrinks to make way for the new virus-specific cells. CMV-seropositive individuals have high numbers of CMV-specific resting-effector type CD8(+) T cells in their peripheral blood (PB). This prompted us to investigate whether CMV infection limits immunologic space at sites where immune reactions are initiated, such as in the lymph nodes (LNs). LN and paired PB samples were analyzed for CMV-, EBV-, and influenza-specific CD8(+) T cells. In marked contrast to blood, LNs contained significantly lower numbers of CX3CR1-expressing effector-type CD8(+) T cells, whereas the CMV-specific cells that were found in the LNs resembled polyfunctional memory-type cells. In contrast, EBV- and influenza-specific CD8(+) T cells were highly similar between PB and LNs both in number and function. Therefore, it is unlikely that CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the LNs restrain the immunologic space of other virus-specific cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T cell populations in blood and lymph nodes in response to viral infections, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: DRB1*12:01 presents a unique subset of epitopes by preferring aromatics in pocket 9.
Abstract: This study characterized the unique peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-DRB1*12:01 (DR1201), an allele studied in the context of various autoimmune diseases, using a peptide competition assay and structural modeling. After defining Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 Matrix Protein M1 (H1MP) 40-54 as a DR1201 restricted epitope, the critical anchor residues within this sequence were confirmed by measuring the relative binding of peptides with non-conservative substitutions in competition with biotin labeled H1MP(40-54) peptide. Based on this information, a set of peptides was designed with single amino acid substitutions at these anchor positions. The overall peptide binding preferences for the DR1201 allele were deduced by incubating these peptides in competition with the reference H1MP(40-54) to determine the relative binding affinities of each to recombinant DR1201 protein. As expected, pocket 1 preferred methionine and aliphatic residues, and tolerated phenylalanine. Pocket 4 was mostly composed of hydrophobic residues, thereby preferentially accommodating aliphatic residues, but could also weakly accommodate lysine due to its slightly acidic environment. Pocket 6 accepted a wide range of amino acids because of the diverse residues that comprise this pocket. Pocket 9 accepted aliphatic and negatively charged amino acids, but showed a remarkable preference for aromatic residues due to the conformation of the pocket, which lacks the typical salt bridge between β57Asp and α76Arg. These binding characteristics contrast with the closely related DR1104 allele, distinguishing DR1201 among the alleles of the HLA-DR5 group. These empirical results were used to develop an algorithm to predict peptide binding to DR1201. This algorithm was used to verify T cell epitopes within novel antigenic peptides identified by tetramer staining and within peptides from published reports that contain putative DR1201 epitopes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes peptide binding preferences of an HLA allele and T cell epitopes, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Inhibition of influenza A virus (H1N1) fusion by benzenesulfonamide derivatives targeting viral hemagglutinin.
Abstract: Hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus plays a crucial role in the early stage of the viral life cycle by binding to sialic acid on the surface of host epithelial cells and mediating fusion between virus envelope and endosome membrane for the release of viral genomes into the cytoplasm. To initiate virus fusion, endosome pH is lowered by acidification causing an irreversible conformational change of HA, which in turn results in a fusogenic HA. In this study, we describe characterization of an HA inhibitor of influenza H1N1 viruses, RO5464466. One-cycle time course study in MDCK cells showed that this compound acted at an early step of influenza virus replication. Results from HA-mediated hemolysis of chicken red blood cells and trypsin sensitivity assay of isolated HA clearly showed that RO5464466 targeted HA. In cell-based assays involving multiple rounds of virus infection and replication, RO5464466 inhibited an established influenza infection. The overall production of progeny viruses, as a result of the compound's inhibitory effect on fusion, was dramatically reduced by 8 log units when compared with a negative control. Furthermore, RO5487624, a close analogue of RO5464466, with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for in vivo efficacy studies displayed a protective effect on mice that were lethally challenged with influenza H1N1 virus. These results might benefit further characterization and development of novel anti-influenza agents by targeting viral hemagglutinin.

Title: Influenza A viral replication is blocked by inhibition of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) stress pathway.
Abstract: Known therapies for influenza A virus infection are complicated by the frequent emergence of resistance. A therapeutic strategy that may escape viral resistance is targeting host cellular mechanisms involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a primitive, evolutionary conserved molecular signaling cascade that has been implicated in multiple biological phenomena including innate immunity and the pathogenesis of certain viral infections. We investigated the effect of influenza A viral infection on ER stress pathways in lung epithelial cells. Influenza A virus induced ER stress in a pathway-specific manner. We showed that the virus activates the IRE1 pathway with little or no concomitant activation of the PERK and the ATF6 pathways. When we examined the effects of modulating the ER stress response on the virus, we found that the molecular chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) significantly inhibits influenza A viral replication. In addition, a specific inhibitor of the IRE1 pathway also blocked viral replication. Our findings constitute the first evidence that ER stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A viral infection. Decreasing viral replication by modulating the host ER stress response is a novel strategy that has important therapeutic implications.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host ER stress pathways affecting viral replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Molecular view of the role of fusion peptides in promoting positive membrane curvature.
Abstract: Fusion peptides are moderately hydrophobic segments of viral and nonviral membrane fusion proteins that enable these proteins to fuse two closely apposed biological membranes. In vitro assays furthermore show that even isolated fusion peptides alone can support membrane fusion in model systems. In addition, the fusion peptides have a distinct effect on the phase diagram of lipid mixtures. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations investigating the effect of a particular fusion peptide, the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide and some of its mutants, on the lipid phase diagram. We detect a systematic shift toward phases with more positive mean curvature in the presence of the peptides, as well as an occurrence of bicontinuous cubic phases, which indicates a stabilization of Gaussian curvature. The wild-type fusion peptide has a stronger effect on the phase behavior as compared to the mutants, which we relate to its boomerang shape. Our results point to a different role of fusion peptides than hitherto assumed, the stabilization of pores rather than stalks along the fusion pathway.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate fusion peptides' effects on membrane curvature, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: A chemokine gene expression signature derived from meta-analysis predicts the pathogenicity of viral respiratory infections.
Abstract: During respiratory viral infections host injury occurs due in part to inappropriate host responses. In this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high- and low-pathogenic infections. From a compendium of 12 studies that included responses to influenza A subtype H5N1, reconstructed 1918 influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.
Relevant: False

Title: Vaccination with M2e-based multiple antigenic peptides: characterization of the B cell response and protection efficacy in inbred and outbred mice.
Abstract: The extracellular domain of the influenza A virus protein matrix protein 2 (M2e) is remarkably conserved between various human isolates and thus is a viable target antigen for a universal influenza vaccine. With the goal of inducing protection in multiple mouse haplotypes, M2e-based multiple antigenic peptides (M2e-MAP) were synthesized to contain promiscuous T helper determinants from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, the hepatitis B virus antigen and the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Here, we investigated the nature of the M2e-MAP-induced B cell response in terms of the distribution of antibody (Ab) secreting cells (ASCs) and Ab isotypes, and tested the protective efficacy in various mouse strains. Immunization of BALB/c mice with M2e-MAPs together with potent adjuvants, CpG 1826 oligonucleotides (ODN) and cholera toxin (CT) elicited high M2e-specific serum Ab titers that protected mice against viral challenge. Subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) delivery of M2e-MAPs resulted in the induction of IgG in serum and airway secretions, however only i.n. immunization induced anti-M2e IgA ASCs locally in the lungs, correlating with M2-specific IgA in the bronchio-alveolar lavage (BAL). Interestingly, both routes of vaccination resulted in equal protection against viral challenge. Moreover, M2e-MAPs induced cross-reactive and protective responses to diverse M2e peptides and variant influenza viruses. However, in contrast to BALB/c mice, immunization of other inbred and outbred mouse strains did not induce protective Abs. This correlated with a defect in T cell but not B cell responsiveness to the M2e-MAPs. Anti-M2e Abs induced by M2e-MAPs are highly cross-reactive and can mediate protection to variant viruses. Although synthetic MAPs are promising designs for vaccines, future constructs will need to be optimized for use in the genetically heterogeneous human population.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on vaccine-induced B cell responses and protection efficacy in mice, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The interaction between the PARP10 protein and the NS1 protein of H5N1 AIV and its effect on virus replication.
Abstract: During the process that AIV infect hosts, the NS1 protein can act on hosts, change corresponding signal pathways, promote the translation of virus proteins and result in virus replication. In our study, we found that PARP domain and Glu-rich region of PARP10 interacted with NS1, and the presence of NS1 could induce PARP10 migrate from cytoplasm to nucleus. NS1 high expression could reduce the endogenous PARP10 expression. Cell cycle analysis showed that with inhibited PARP10 expression, NS1 could induce cell arrest in G2-M stage, and the percentage of cells in G2-M stage rise from the previous 10%-45%, consistent with the cell proliferation result. Plague forming unit measurement showed that inhibited PARP10 expression could help virus replication. In a word, our results showed that NS1 acts on host cells and PARP10 plays a regulating role in virus replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates interaction between host protein PARP10 and viral NS1 protein and its effect on virus replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mimotopes selected with neutralizing antibodies against multiple subtypes of influenza A.
Abstract: The mimotopes of viruses are considered as the good targets for vaccine design. We prepared mimotopes against multiple subtypes of influenza A and evaluate their immune responses in flu virus challenged Balb/c mice. The mimotopes of influenza A including pandemic H1N1, H3N2, H2N2 and H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus were screened by peptide phage display libraries, respectively. These mimotopes were engineered in one protein as multi- epitopes in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified. Balb/c mice were immunized using the multi-mimotopes protein and specific antibody responses were analyzed using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lung inflammation level was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Linear heptopeptide and dodecapeptide mimotopes were obtained for these influenza virus. The recombinant multi-mimotopes protein was a 73 kDa fusion protein. Comparing immunized infected groups with unimmunized infected subsets, significant differences were observed in the body weight loss and survival rate. The antiserum contained higher HI Ab titer against H1N1 virus and the lung inflammation level were significantly decreased in immunized infected groups. Phage-displayed mimotopes against multiple subtypes of influenza A were accessible to the mouse immune system and triggered a humoral response to above virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes mimotopes and immune responses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Emergence and dissemination of a swine H3N2 reassortant influenza virus with 2009 pandemic H1N1 genes in pigs in China.
Abstract: The 2009 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) has been frequently introduced to pigs and has reassorted with other swine viruses. Recently, H3N2 reassortants with pdm/09-like internal genes were isolated in Guangxi and Hong Kong, China. Genetic and epidemiological analyses suggest that these viruses have circulated in swine for some time. This is the first evidence that swine reassortant viruses with pdm/09-like genes may have become established in the field, altering the landscape of human and swine influenza.
Relevant: False

Title: Identification of RNA helicase A as a cellular factor that interacts with influenza A virus NS1 protein and its role in the virus life cycle.
Abstract: Influenza A virus NS1 protein has multiple functions in the infected cell during the virus life cycle. Identification of novel cellular factors that interact with NS1 and understanding their functions in virus infection are of great interest. Recombinant viruses carrying a tagged NS1 are valuable for investigation of interactions between NS1 and cellular factors in the context of virus infection. Here, we report the generation of replication-competent recombinant influenza A viruses bearing a Strep tag in the NS1 protein. Purification of a protein complex associated with Strep-tagged NS1 from virus-infected cells followed by mass spectrometry revealed a number of attractive host factors. Among them, we focused our study on RNA helicase A (RHA) in this report. Through biomedical and functional analyses, we demonstrated that RHA interacts with NS1 in an RNA-dependent manner. Knockdown of RHA resulted in a significant reduction on virus yield and polymerase activity in a minigenome assay. Our cell-free viral genome replication assay showed that viral RNA replication and transcription can be enhanced by addition of RHA, and the enhanced effect of RHA required its ATP-dependent helicase activity. In summary, we established a system to identify cellular factors that interact with NS1 protein during virus infection and furthermore demonstrated that RHA interacts with NS1 and enhances viral replication and transcription.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host factors interacting with viral NS1 protein and their role in viral replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Anti-influenza virus effect of aqueous extracts from dandelion.
Abstract: Human influenza is a seasonal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Anti-flu Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played a significant role in fighting the virus pandemic. In TCM, dandelion is a commonly used ingredient in many therapeutic remedies, either alone or in conjunction with other natural substances. Evidence suggests that dandelion is associated with a variety of pharmacological activities. In this study, we evaluated anti-influenza virus activity of an aqueous extract from dandelion, which was tested for in vitro antiviral activity against influenza virus type A, human A/PR/8/34 and WSN (H1N1). Results obstained using antiviral assays, minigenome assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that 0.625-5 mg/ml of dandelion extracts inhibited infections in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) of PR8 or WSN viruses, as well as inhibited polymerase activity and reduced virus nucleoprotein (NP) RNA level. The plant extract did not exhibit any apparent negative effects on cell viability, metabolism or proliferation at the effective dose. This result is consistent with the added advantage of lacking any reported complications of the plant's utility in traditional medicine over several centuries. The antiviral activity of dandelion extracts indicates that a component or components of these extracts possess anti-influenza virus properties. Mechanisms of reduction of viral growth in MDCK or A549 cells by dandelion involve inhibition on virus replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral effects of dandelion extracts on influenza virus replication without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Swine influenza virus infection in different age groups of pigs in farrow-to-finish farms in Thailand.
Abstract: Understanding swine influenza virus (SIV) ecology has become more and more important from both the pig industry and public health points of views. However, the mechanism whereby SIV occurs in pig farms is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a proper strategy for SIV surveillance. We conducted longitudinal monitoring in 6 farrow-to-finish farms in the central region of Thailand from 2008 to 2009. Nasal swabs and serum samples were collected periodically from clinically healthy pigs consisting of sows, fattening pigs, weaned piglets and pigs transferred from other farms. A total of 731 nasal swabs were subjected to virus isolation and 641 serum samples were subjected to detection of SIV antibodies against H1 and H3 subtypes using the hemagglutination inhibition test and ELISA. Twelve SIVs were isolated in this study and eleven were from piglets aged 4 and 8 weeks. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that SIVs isolated from different farms shared a common ancestor. Antibodies against SIVs were detected in fattening pigs on farms with no SIV isolation in the respective periods studied. These observations suggested that piglets aged 8 weeks or younger could be a main target for SIV isolation. Farm-to-farm transmission was suggested for farms where pigs from other farms are introduced periodically. In addition, antibodies against SIVs detected in fattening pigs could be a marker for SIV infection in a farm. The present study provided important information on SIV surveillance that will enable better understanding of SIV ecology in farrow-to-finish farms.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and epidemiology of swine influenza virus without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of the non-structural (NS) gene of influenza A viruses isolated in Kazakhstan in 2002-2009.
Abstract: Although the important role of the non-structural (NS1 and NEP) gene of influenza A in virulence of the virus is well established, our knowledge about the extent of variation in the NS gene pool of influenza A viruses in their natural reservoirs in Kazakhstan is incomplete. 17 influenza A viruses of different subtypes were studied in this paper. Seven types of haemagglutinin and five different neuraminidase subtypes in eight combinations were found among the isolated viruses. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of isolated viruses revealed a substantial number of silent mutations, which results in high degree of homology in amino acid sequences. By phylogenetic analysis it was shown that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A with 5 Clades and B, were present at the same time in Kazakhstan. The degree of variation within the alleles was very low. In our study allele A viruses had a maximum of 5% amino acid divergence in Clade while allele B viruses had only 4% amino acid divergence.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic analysis of the NS gene and genetic variation without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Oseltamivir inhibits H7 influenza virus replication in mice inoculated by the ocular route.
Abstract: The majority of human infections associated with H7 influenza viruses have resulted in ocular and not respiratory disease. While oseltamivir has been prescribed to individuals presenting with conjunctivitis following H7 virus exposure, it is unknown if oseltamivir inhibits virus replication in ocular tissue. We demonstrate that H7 viruses possess sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors and that administration of oseltamivir before ocular virus challenge in mice inhibits H7N7 and H7N3 virus replication in ocular and respiratory tissues.

Title: Seasonal influenza A virus in feces of hospitalized adults.
Abstract: In a cohort of hospitalized adults with seasonal influenza A in Hong Kong, viral RNA was frequently (47%) detected in stool specimens. Viable virus was rarely isolated. Viral RNA positivity had little correlation with gastrointestinal symptoms and outcomes. In vitro studies suggested low potential for seasonal influenza viruses to cause direct intestinal infections.

Title: Temporally structured metapopulation dynamics and persistence of influenza A H3N2 virus in humans.
Abstract: Populations of seasonal influenza virus experience strong annual bottlenecks that pose a considerable extinction risk. It has been suggested that an influenza source population located in tropical Southeast or East Asia seeds annual temperate epidemics. Here we investigate the seasonal dynamics and migration patterns of influenza A H3N2 virus by analysis of virus samples obtained from 2003 to 2006 from Australia, Europe, Japan, New York, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and newly sequenced viruses from Hong Kong. In contrast to annual temperate epidemics, relatively low levels of relative genetic diversity and no seasonal fluctuations characterized virus populations in tropical Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis using discrete temporal and spatial characters reveal high rates of viral migration between urban centers tested. Although the virus population that migrated between Southeast Asia and Hong Kong persisted through time, this was dependent on virus input from temperate regions and these tropical regions did not maintain a source for annual H3N2 influenza epidemics. We further show that multiple lineages may seed annual influenza epidemics, and that each region may function as a potential source population. We therefore propose that the global persistence of H3N2 influenza A virus is the result of a migrating metapopulation in which multiple different localities may seed seasonal epidemics in temperate regions in a given year. Such complex global migration dynamics may confound control efforts and contribute to the emergence and spread of antigenic variants and drug-resistant viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on metapopulation dynamics and migration patterns of influenza A H3N2 virus, analyzing genetic diversity and phylogeography, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A supramolecular assembly formed by influenza A virus genomic RNA segments.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome consists of eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) that form viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Even though evidence supporting segment-specific packaging of vRNAs is accumulating, the mechanism ensuring selective packaging of one copy of each vRNA into the viral particles remains largely unknown. We used electron tomography to show that the eight vRNPs emerge from a common 'transition zone' located underneath the matrix layer at the budding tip of the virions, where they appear to be interconnected and often form a star-like structure. This zone appears as a platform in 3D surface rendering and is thick enough to contain all known packaging signals. In vitro, all vRNA segments are involved in a single network of intermolecular interactions. The regions involved in the strongest interactions were identified and correspond to known packaging signals. A limited set of nucleotides in the 5' region of vRNA 7 was shown to interact with vRNA 6 and to be crucial for packaging of the former vRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model in which the eight genomic RNA segments are selected and packaged as an organized supramolecular complex held together by direct base pairing of the packaging signals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the structural organization and packaging of influenza A virus RNA segments without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Oseltamivir in seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza: a comprehensive review of 10-years clinical experience.
Abstract: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is an orally administered antiviral for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections that is registered in more than 100 countries worldwide. More than 83 million patients have been exposed to the product since its introduction. Oseltamivir is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in the clinical management of pandemic and seasonal influenza of varying severity, and as the primary antiviral agent for treatment of avian H5N1 influenza infection in humans. This article is a nonsystematic review of the experience gained from the first 10 years of using oseltamivir for influenza infections since its launch in early 2000, emphasizing recent advances in our understanding of the product and its clinical utility in five main areas. The article reviews the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, including information on special populations such as children and elderly adults, and the co-administration of oseltamivir with other agents. This is followed by a summary of data on the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis in patients with all types of influenza, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza. The implications of changes in susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to oseltamivir and other antiviral agents are also described, as is the emergence of antiviral resistance during and after the 2009 pandemic. The fourth main section deals with the safety profile of oseltamivir in standard and special patient populations, and reviews spontaneously reported adverse event data from the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods and the topical issue of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Finally, the article considers the pharmacoeconomics of oseltamivir in comparison with vaccination and usual care regimens, and as a component of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical review of oseltamivir use in influenza treatment and prophylaxis, focusing on pharmacology and clinical experience without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Transmission dynamics of low pathogenicity avian influenza infections in Turkey flocks.
Abstract: Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains (HPAI), which can threaten human health and cause huge economic losses. The current knowledge on the mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is insufficient for predicting which H5 or H7 strains will mutate into an HPAI strain, and since the molecular changes necessary for the change in virulence seemingly occur at random, the probability of mutation depends on the number of virus replicates, which is associated with the number of birds that acquire infection. We estimated the transmission dynamics of LPAI viruses in turkeys using serosurveillance data from past epidemics in Italy. We fitted the proportions of birds infected in 36 flocks into a hierarchical model to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) and possible variations in R(0) among flocks caused by differences among farms. We also estimated the distributions of the latent and infectious periods, using experimental infection data with outbreak strains. These were then combined with the R(0) to simulate LPAI outbreaks and characterise the resulting dynamics. The estimated mean within-flock R(0) in the population of infected flocks was 5.5, indicating that an infectious bird would infect an average of more than five susceptible birds. The results also indicate that the presence of seropositive birds does not necessarily mean that the virus has already been cleared and the flock is no longer infective, so that seropositive flocks may still constitute a risk of infection for other flocks. In light of these results, the enforcement of appropriate restrictions, the culling of seropositive flocks, or pre-emptive slaughtering may be useful. The model and parameter estimates presented in this paper provide the first complete picture of LPAI dynamics in turkey flocks and could be used for designing a suitable surveillance program.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper models transmission dynamics of low pathogenicity avian influenza in turkey flocks using epidemiological data, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: IFITM3 inhibits influenza A virus infection by preventing cytosolic entry.
Abstract: To replicate, viruses must gain access to the host cell's resources. Interferon (IFN) regulates the actions of a large complement of interferon effector genes (IEGs) that prevent viral replication. The interferon inducible transmembrane protein family members, IFITM1, 2 and 3, are IEGs required for inhibition of influenza A virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus replication in vitro. Here we report that IFN prevents emergence of viral genomes from the endosomal pathway, and that IFITM3 is both necessary and sufficient for this function. Notably, viral pseudoparticles were inhibited from transferring their contents into the host cell cytosol by IFN, and IFITM3 was required and sufficient for this action. We further demonstrate that IFN expands Rab7 and LAMP1-containing structures, and that IFITM3 overexpression is sufficient for this phenotype. Moreover, IFITM3 partially resides in late endosomal and lysosomal structures, placing it in the path of invading viruses. Collectively our data are consistent with the prediction that viruses that fuse in the late endosomes or lysosomes are vulnerable to IFITM3's actions, while viruses that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomes may avoid inhibition. Multiple viruses enter host cells through the late endocytic pathway, and many of these invaders are attenuated by IFN. Therefore these findings are likely to have significance for the intrinsic immune system's neutralization of a diverse array of threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral activity of IFITM3 protein against influenza A virus infection, describing a mechanism of viral inhibition, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1): updated nomenclature.
Abstract: Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) throughout many regions of the eastern hemisphere has led to the emergence of new phylogenetic groups. A total of 1637 new H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences have become available since the previous nomenclature recommendations described in 2009 by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group. A comprehensive analysis including all the new data is needed to update HA clade nomenclature. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from data sets of all available H5N1 HA sequences. New clades were designated on the basis of phylogeny and p-distance using the pre-established nomenclature system (Emerg Infec Dis 2008; 14:e1). Each circulating H5N1 clade was subjected to further phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide sequence divergence calculations. All recently circulating clades (clade 1 in the Mekong River Delta, 2.1.3 in Indonesia, 2.2 in India/Bangladesh, 2.2.1 in Egypt, 2.3.2, 2.3.4 and 7 in Asia) required assignment of divergent HA genes to new second-, third-, and/or fourth-order clades. At the same time, clades 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and several second- and third-order groups from clade 2 have not been detected since 2008 or earlier. New designations are recommended for 12 HA clades, named according to previously defined criteria. In addition, viruses from 13 clades have not been detected since 2008 or earlier. The periodic updating of this dynamic classification system allows continued use of a unified nomenclature in all H5N1 studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper updates the nomenclature of H5N1 clades based on phylogenetic analysis but does not discuss phenotypic consequences of these genotypes.

Title: Viva la revolución: rethinking influenza a virus antigenic drift.
Abstract: Rapid antigenic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin has precluded developing vaccines that provide durable protection. The yearly costs of influenza (circa $10(11) in the USA alone) easily justify investments in better understanding the interaction of influenza with antibodies and other inducible elements of the immune system that potentially limit or circumvent antigenic variation. Here, I summarize exciting new findings that offer the possibility of a quantum improvement in vaccine efficacy, focusing on studies clearly documenting robust neutralizing antibody responses to the conserved stem region of the hemagglutinin.

Title: FluReF, an automated flu virus reassortment finder based on phylogenetic trees.
Abstract: Reassortments are events in the evolution of the genome of influenza (flu), whereby segments of the genome are exchanged between different strains. As reassortments have been implicated in major human pandemics of the last century, their identification has become a health priority. While such identification can be done "by hand" on a small dataset, researchers and health authorities are building up enormous databases of genomic sequences for every flu strain, so that it is imperative to develop automated identification methods. However, current methods are limited to pairwise segment comparisons. We present FluReF, a fully automated flu virus reassortment finder. FluReF is inspired by the visual approach to reassortment identification and uses the reconstructed phylogenetic trees of the individual segments and of the full genome. We also present a simple flu evolution simulator, based on the current, source-sink, hypothesis for flu cycles. On synthetic datasets produced by our simulator, FluReF, tuned for a 0% false positive rate, yielded false negative rates of less than 10%. FluReF corroborated two new reassortments identified by visual analysis of 75 Human H3N2 New York flu strains from 2005-2008 and gave partial verification of reassortments found using another bioinformatics method. FluReF finds reassortments by a bottom-up search of the full-genome and segment-based phylogenetic trees for candidate clades--groups of one or more sampled viruses that are separated from the other variants from the same season. Candidate clades in each tree are tested to guarantee confidence values, using the lengths of key edges as well as other tree parameters; clades with reassortments must have validated incongruencies among segment trees. FluReF demonstrates robustness of prediction for geographically and temporally expanded datasets, and is not limited to finding reassortments with previously collected sequences. The complete source code is available from http://lcbb.epfl.ch/software.html.

Title: Ultrasensitive detection of rare mutations using next-generation targeted resequencing.
Abstract: With next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, one can interrogate a specific genomic region of interest at very high depth of coverage and identify less prevalent, rare mutations in heterogeneous clinical samples. However, the mutation detection levels are limited by the error rate of the sequencing technology as well as by the availability of variant-calling algorithms with high statistical power and low false positive rates. We demonstrate that we can robustly detect mutations at 0.1% fractional representation. This represents accurate detection of one mutant per every 1000 wild-type alleles. To achieve this sensitive level of mutation detection, we integrate a high accuracy indexing strategy and reference replication for estimating sequencing error variance. We employ a statistical model to estimate the error rate at each position of the reference and to quantify the fraction of variant base in the sample. Our method is highly specific (99%) and sensitive (100%) when applied to a known 0.1% sample fraction admixture of two synthetic DNA samples to validate our method. As a clinical application of this method, we analyzed nine clinical samples of H1N1 influenza A and detected an oseltamivir (antiviral therapy) resistance mutation in the H1N1 neuraminidase gene at a sample fraction of 0.18%.
Relevant: False

Title: Migratory flyway and geographical distance are barriers to the gene flow of influenza virus among North American birds.
Abstract: Despite the importance of migratory birds in the ecology and evolution of avian influenza virus (AIV), there is a lack of information on the patterns of AIV spread at the intra-continental scale. We applied a variety of statistical phylogeographic techniques to a plethora of viral genome sequence data to determine the strength, pattern and determinants of gene flow in AIV sampled from wild birds in North America. These analyses revealed a clear isolation-by-distance of AIV among sampling localities. In addition, we show that phylogeographic models incorporating information on the avian flyway of sampling proved a better fit to the observed sequence data than those specifying homogeneous or random rates of gene flow among localities. In sum, these data strongly suggest that the intra-continental spread of AIV by migratory birds is subject to major ecological barriers, including spatial distance and avian flyway.

Title: Molecular evolution of the H6 subtype influenza A viruses from poultry in eastern China from 2002 to 2010.
Abstract: Although extensive data demonstrates that the majority of H6 duck isolates belonged to a single H6N2 virus lineage with a single gene constellation in southern China from 2000 to 2005, the prevalence of H6N2 virus in poultry in Eastern China is largely unknown. Epidemiology revealed that H6N2 viruses were the most frequently detected influenza subtypes in live bird markets from 2002 to 2008 in Eastern China, but from 2009 onwards, they were replaced with novel H6N6 viruses. We phylogenetically and antigenically analyzed 42 H6 viruses isolated mainly in domestic ducks from 2002 to 2010 in Eastern China. Surprisingly, none of these isolates grouped with the previously described H6N2 viruses which belonged to a single H6N2 virus lineage with a single gene constellation in domestic ducks in southern China from 2000 to 2005. Two distinct hemagglutinin lineages were identified and they all underwent frequent reassortment with multiple virus subtypes from the natural gene pool, but few reassortants were persistent or prevalent. Five subtypes of H6 influenza viruses (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6 and H6N8) cocirculated in Eastern China, which form a significant part of the natural influenza virus reservoir in domestic ducks, and significant viral reassortment is still ongoing in this species.

Title: Gamma-irradiated influenza virus uniquely induces IFN-I mediated lymphocyte activation independent of the TLR7/MyD88 pathway.
Abstract: We have shown previously in mice, that infection with live viruses, including influenza/A and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), induces systemic partial activation of lymphocytes, characterized by cell surface expression of CD69 and CD86, but not CD25. This partial lymphocytes activation is mediated by type-I interferons (IFN-I). Importantly, we have shown that γ-irradiated SFV does not induce IFN-I and the associated lymphocyte activation. Here we report that, in contrast to SFV, γ-irradiated influenza A virus elicits partial lymphocyte activation in vivo. Furthermore, we show that when using influenza viruses inactivated by a variety of methods (UV, ionising radiation and formalin treatment), as well as commercially available influenza vaccines, only γ-irradiated influenza virus is able to trigger IFN-I-dependent partial lymphocyte activation in the absence of the TLR7/MyD88 signalling pathways. Our data suggest an important mechanism for the recognition of γ-irradiated influenza vaccine by cytosolic receptors, which correspond with the ability of γ-irradiated influenza virus to induce cross-reactive and cross-protective cytotoxic T cell responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates immune activation by gamma-irradiated influenza virus and mechanisms of recognition, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Generation and comprehensive analysis of an influenza virus polymerase cellular interaction network.
Abstract: The influenza virus transcribes and replicates its genome inside the nucleus of infected cells. Both activities are performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is composed of the three subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, and recent studies have shown that it requires host cell factors to transcribe and replicate the viral genome. To identify these cellular partners, we generated a comprehensive physical interaction map between each polymerase subunit and the host cellular proteome. A total of 109 human interactors were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens, whereas 90 were retrieved by literature mining. We built the FluPol interactome network composed of the influenza virus polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2) and the nucleoprotein NP and 234 human proteins that are connected through 279 viral-cellular protein interactions. Analysis of this interactome map revealed enriched cellular functions associated with the influenza virus polymerase, including host factors involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and mRNA processing. We confirmed that eight influenza virus polymerase-interacting proteins are required for virus replication and transcriptional activity of the viral polymerase. These are involved in cellular transcription (C14orf166, COPS5, MNAT1, NMI, and POLR2A), translation (EIF3S6IP), nuclear transport (NUP54), and DNA repair (FANCG). Conversely, we identified PRKRA, which acts as an inhibitor of the viral polymerase transcriptional activity and thus is required for the cellular antiviral response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study maps influenza polymerase-host protein interactions and their role in viral replication, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of H6 influenza viruses isolated from rosy-billed pochards (Netta peposaca) in Argentina reveals the presence of different HA gene clusters.
Abstract: Until recently, influenza A viruses from wild waterfowl in South America were rarely isolated and/or characterized. To explore the ecology of influenza A viruses in this region, a long-term surveillance program was established in 2006 for resident and migratory water birds in Argentina. We report the characterization of 5 avian influenza viruses of the H6 hemagglutinin (HA) subtype isolated from rosy-billed pochards (Netta peposaca). Three of these viruses were paired to an N2 NA subtype, while the other two were of the N8 subtype. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the internal gene segments revealed a close relationship with influenza viruses from South America, forming a unique clade and supporting the notion of independent evolution from influenza A viruses in other latitudes. The presence of NS alleles A and B was also identified. The HA and NA genes formed unique clades separate from North American and Eurasian viruses, with the exception of the HA gene of one isolate, which was more closely related to the North American lineage, suggesting possible interactions between viruses of North American and South American lineages. Animal studies suggested that these Argentine H6 viruses could replicate and transmit inefficiently in chickens, indicating limited adaptation to poultry. Our results highlight the importance of continued influenza virus surveillance in wild birds of South America, especially considering the unique evolution of these viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports phylogenetic analysis and replication/transmission efficiency of H6 viruses in birds but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Development of an improved methodology to detect infectious airborne influenza virus using the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler.
Abstract: A unique two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler has been developed at NIOSH that can separate aerosols into three size fractions. The ability of this sampler to collect infectious airborne viruses from a calm-air chamber loaded with influenza A virus was tested. The sampler's efficiency at collecting aerosolized viral particles from a calm-air chamber is essentially the same as that from the high performance SKC BioSampler that collects un-fractionated particles directly into a liquid media (2.4 × 10(4) total viral particles per liter of sampled air (TVP/L) versus 2.6 × 10(4) TVP/L, respectively, after 15 min) and the efficiency is relatively constant over collection times of 15, 30 and 60 min. Approximately 34% of the aerosolized infectious virus collected after 15 min with the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler remained infectious, and infectious virus was found in all three size fractions. After 60 min of sampling, the infectious virus/liter air found in the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was 15% of that found in the SKC BioSampler. This preservation of infectivity by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was maintained even when the initial infectivity prior to aerosolization was as low as 0.06%. The utility of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was further extended by incorporating an enhanced infectivity detection methodology developed in our laboratory, the viral replication assay, which amplified the infectious virus making it more readily detectable.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on methodology for detecting infectious airborne influenza virus and does not address genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Molecular epidemiology of avian influenza viruses circulating among healthy poultry flocks in farms in northern Vietnam.
Abstract: Repeated epizootics of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 were reported from 2003 to 2005 among poultry in Vietnam. More than 200 million birds were killed to control the spread of the disease. Human cases of H5N1 infection have been sporadically reported in an area where repeated H5N1 outbreaks among birds had occurred. Subtype H5N1 strains are established as endemic among poultry in Vietnam, however, insights into how avian influenza viruses including the H5N1 subtype are maintained in endemic areas is not clear. In order to determine the prevalence of different avian influenza viruses (AIVs), including H5N1 circulating among poultry in northern Vietnam, surveillance was conducted during the years 2006-2009. A subtype H5N1 strain was isolated from an apparently healthy duck reared on a farm in northern Vietnam in 2008 and was identified as an HPAI. Although only one H5N1 virus was isolated, it supports the view that healthy domestic ducks play a pivotal role in maintaining and transmitting H5N1 viruses which cause disease outbreaks in northern Vietnam. In addition, a total of 26 AIVs with low pathogenicity were isolated from poultry and phylogenetic analysis of all the eight gene segments revealed their diverse genetical backgrounds, implying that reassortments have occurred frequently among strains in northern Vietnam. It is, therefore, important to monitor the prevalence of influenza viruses among healthy poultry between epidemics in an area where AIVs are endemic.

Title: [Bioinformatics technologies for the analysis of antigenic evolution of influenza viruses].
Abstract: Human influenza viruses mutate from time to time, causing annual epidemics worldwide. The strong immune pressure in the human population selects a new variant every year, and the antigenic change is one of the primary reasons why vaccination is not a perfect measure to control seasonal influenza. Thus prediction of antigenic change of influenza A virus has been one of the major public health goals. In this review bioinformatics technologies that have been developed to achieve this goal were summarized.

Title: Two adjacent mutations on chromosome 16 discovered in a patient presenting with generalized convulsions after influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: A 49-year-old otherwise healthy man was admitted to our hospital because of repeated generalized convulsions after influenza A virus infection. His family history was notable for consanguinity of parents. Initial laboratory tests revealed metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia, as well as an elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol level. He was diagnosed with Gitelman's syndrome and cholesteryl ester transfer protein deficiency by identifying homozygous mutations of causative genes, SLC12A3 and CETP, respectively. These two genes are located in the vicinity on chromosome 16, suggesting the possibility of autozygosity. This is the first case report highlighting the co-existence of these genetic disorders.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical case report of genetic mutations in human genes unrelated to influenza viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Taming influenza viruses.
Abstract: Plasmid-based reverse genetics systems allow the artificial generation of viruses with cloned cDNA-derived genomes. Since the establishment of such systems for influenza virus, numerous attempts have been made to tame this pathogenic agent. In particular, several types of viruses expressing foreign genes have been generated and used to further our knowledge of influenza virus replication and pathogenicity and to develop novel influenza vaccines. Here, we review these achievements and discuss future perspectives.

Title: Vaccination with drifted variants of avian H5 hemagglutinin protein elicits a broadened antibody response that is protective against challenge with homologous or drifted live H5 influenza virus.
Abstract: Substantial H5 influenza HA directed immunity is elicited after vaccination of human subjects who had been previously immunized with a drifted H5 HA variant. We sought to investigate the characteristics of H5 HA specific immune responses in more depth by developing an animal model of H5 HA vaccination using drift variants of recombinant H5 HA proteins. HA proteins derived from influenzas A/Vietnam/1203/04 (Clade 1) and A/Indonesia/05/05 (Clade 2.1) were chosen. The sequence of vaccination consisted of two doses of homologous protein, followed by one additional dose of the homologous or heterologous, drifted HA protein. Each dose of HA was combined with CpG as an adjuvant and was injected subcutaneously. All the animals exhibited a serum IgG antibody response that cross-reacted with both HAs in an ELISA. However, those animals that received the drifted variant exhibited higher reactivity to the heterologous HA. Competitive ELISA of serum from drift-variant recipients showed evidence of antibody focusing towards the drifted HA, suggesting modification of the response towards improved cross-reactivity, though development of neutralizing antibodies was limited. Nevertheless, animals were protected against live-virus challenge, and passive transfer of serum was sufficient to confer protection to otherwise naïve mice, indicating that both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies offer some degree of protection. These findings suggest that pre-vaccination against H5 influenza has the potential to prime immunity against emerging drifted H5 strains, and could also lower the dose requirements of vaccination in the event of a pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on immune responses to drifted H5 hemagglutinin variants and protection, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multisite virological influenza surveillance in India: 2004-2008.
Abstract: Influenza surveillance is important to identify circulating, emerging/reemerging strains and unusual epidemiological trends. With these objectives, a multisite human influenza surveillance network was initiated in India in 2004. Epidemiologic data and throat swabs for laboratory testing were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Virus isolation was carried out in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and strains identified by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Meteorological data were collected. From September 2004 to December 2008, 617 (4·43%) of 13928 cases yielded isolates: 27·8% were influenza A(H1N1), 29·8% were type A(H3N2), and 42·3% were type B. The yearly type and subtype distribution varied significantly from site to site. Peak influenza activity was observed from June to August in Delhi, Pune, and Kolkata and October to December in Chennai. Maximum influenza activity was seen during the rains in Delhi, Pune, Chennai, and Kolkata in correlation with virus isolations. Multivariate analysis of ILI cases showed chill/rigors, cough, fatigue, and ILI in family, correlated positively with isolation. Genetic analysis of Indian isolates revealed that viruses matched with vaccine strains by and large. Overlapping between circulating and vaccine component strains of consecutive years was also observed. Seasonal influenza A(H1N1), H3N2, and type B co-circulated in all regions without any particular pattern of movement of any subtype. Year-round limited influenza activity with peaks during rains was observed. Genetic drifts and varying seasonality in different parts of the country suggest that a staggered timing of vaccination may be appropriate for India.

Reason: This is a surveillance study describing circulating influenza strains and genetic drift but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A critical role of IL-17 in modulating the B-cell response during H5N1 influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a member of the IL-17 cytokine family, plays a crucial role in mediating the immune response against extracellular bacteria and fungi in the lung. Although there is increasing evidence that IL-17 is involved in protective immunity against H1 and H3 influenza virus infections, little is known about the role of IL-17 in the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection. In this study, we show that H5N1-infected IL-17 knockout (KO) mice exhibit markedly increased weight loss, more pronounced lung immunopathology and significantly reduced survival rates as compared with infected wild-type controls. Moreover, the frequency of B cells in the lung were substantially decreased in IL-17 KO mice after virus infection, which correlated with reduced CXCR5 expression in B cells and decreased CXCL13 production in the lung tissue of IL-17 KO mice. Consistent with this observation, B cells from IL-17 KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in chemokine-mediated migration in culture. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for IL-17 in mediating the recruitment of B cells to the site of pulmonary influenza virus infection in mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune response (IL-17 role) during H5N1 infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Chicken interferon alpha pretreatment reduces virus replication of pandemic H1N1 and H5N9 avian influenza viruses in lung cell cultures from different avian species.
Abstract: Type I interferons, including interferon alpha (IFN-α), represent one of the first lines of innate immune defense against influenza virus infection. Following natural infection of chickens with avian influenza virus (AIV), transcription of IFN-α is quickly up regulated along with multiple other immune-related genes. Chicken IFN-α up regulates a number of important anti-viral response genes and has been demonstrated to be an important cytokine to establish anti-viral immunity. However, the mechanisms by which interferon inhibit virus replication in avian species remains unknown as does the biological activity of chicken interferon in other avian species. In these studies, we assessed the protective potential of exogenous chicken IFN-α applied to chicken, duck, and turkey primary lung cell cultures prior to infection with the pandemic H1N1 virus (A/turkey/Virginia/SEP-4/2009) and an established avian H5N9 virus (A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968). Growth kinetics and induction of select immune response genes, including IFN-α and myxovirus-resistance gene I (Mx), as well as proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), were measured in response to chicken IFN-α and viral infection over time. Results demonstrate that pretreatment with chicken IFN-α before AIV infection significantly reduced virus replication in both chicken-and turkey-origin lung cells and to a lesser degree the duck-origin cells. Virus growth was reduced by approximately 200-fold in chicken and turkey cells and 30-fold in duck cells after 48 hours of incubation. Interferon treatment also significantly decreased the interferon and proinflammatory response during viral infection. In general, infection with the H1N1 virus resulted in an attenuated interferon and proinflammatory response in these cell lines, compared to the H5N9 virus. Taken together, these studies show that chicken IFN-α reduces virus replication, lower host innate immune response following infection, and is biologically active in other avian species.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of chicken interferon alpha on virus replication in avian cells, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Lethal synergism of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is associated with loss of murine lung repair responses.
Abstract: Secondary bacterial infections increase disease severity of influenza virus infections and contribute greatly to increased morbidity and mortality during pandemics. To study secondary bacterial infection following influenza virus infection, mice were inoculated with sublethal doses of 2009 seasonal H1N1 virus (NIH50) or pandemic H1N1 virus (Mex09) followed by inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae 48 h later. Disease was characterized by assessment of weight loss and survival, titration of virus and bacteria by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), histopathology, expression microarray, and immunohistochemistry. Mice inoculated with virus alone showed 100% survival for all groups. Mice inoculated with Mex09 plus S. pneumoniae showed severe weight loss and 100% mortality with severe alveolitis, denuded bronchiolar epithelium, and widespread expression of apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3. In contrast, mice inoculated with NIH50 plus S. pneumoniae showed increased weight loss, 100% survival, and slightly enhanced lung pathology. Mex09-S. pneumoniae coinfection also resulted in increased S. pneumoniae replication in lung and bacteremia late in infection. Global gene expression profiling revealed that Mex09-S. pneumoniae coinfection did not induce significantly more severe inflammatory responses but featured significant loss of epithelial cell reproliferation and repair responses. Histopathological examination for cell proliferation marker MCM7 showed significant staining of airway epithelial cells in all groups except Mex09-S. pneumoniae-infected mice. This study demonstrates that secondary bacterial infection during 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus infection resulted in more severe disease and loss of lung repair responses than did seasonal influenza viral and bacterial coinfection. Moreover, this study provides novel insights into influenza virus and bacterial coinfection by showing correlation of lethal outcome with loss of airway basal epithelial cells and associated lung repair responses. Secondary bacterial pneumonias lead to increased disease severity and have resulted in a significant percentage of deaths during influenza pandemics. To understand the biological basis for the interaction of bacterial and viral infections, mice were infected with sublethal doses of 2009 seasonal H1N1 and pandemic H1N1 viruses followed by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 48 h later. Only infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and S. pneumoniae resulted in severe disease with a 100% fatality rate. Analysis of the host response to infection during lethal coinfection showed a significant loss of responses associated with lung repair that was not observed in any of the other experimental groups. This group of mice also showed enhanced bacterial replication in the lung. This study reveals that the extent of lung damage during viral infection influences the severity of secondary bacterial infections and may help explain some differences in mortality during influenza pandemics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host responses and disease severity in coinfection models, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block replication of influenza a and other viruses.
Abstract: We have previously reported that two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs), called AG879 and tyrphostin A9 (A9), can each block the replication of influenza A virus in cultured cells. In this study, we further characterized the in vitro antiviral efficacies and specificities of these agents. The 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each against influenza A was found to be in the high nanomolar range, and the selectivity index (SI = 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)]/EC(50)) was determined to be >324 for AG879 and 50 for A9, indicating that therapeutically useful concentrations of each drug produce only low levels of cytotoxicity. Each compound showed efficacy against representative laboratory strains of both human influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Importantly, no drug-resistant influenza virus strains emerged even after 25 viral passages in the presence of AG879, whereas viruses resistant to amantadine appeared after only 3 passages. AG879 and A9 each also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses, including Sendai virus (Paramyxoviridae), herpes simplex virus (Herpesviridae), mouse hepatitis virus (Coronaviridae), and rhesus rotavirus (Reoviridae), but not against Pichinde virus (Arenaviridae). These results together suggest that RTKIs may be useful as therapeutics against viral pathogens, including but not limited to influenza, due to their high selectivity indices, low frequency of drug resistance, and broad-spectrum antiviral activities.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes antiviral activity of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors on influenza replication but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification of BPR3P0128 as an inhibitor of cap-snatching activities of influenza virus.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify the antiviral mechanism of a novel compound, BPR3P0128. From a large-scale screening of a library of small compounds, BPR3P compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of influenza viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. BPR3P0128 exhibited inhibitory activity against both influenza A and B viruses. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were in the range of 51 to 190 nM in MDCK cells, as measured by inhibition-of-cytopathic-effect assays. BPR3P0128 appeared to target the viral replication cycle but had no effect on viral adsorption. The inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA transcription by BPR3P0128 was more prominent with a concurrent increase in cap-independent cRNA replication in a primer extension assay, suggesting a role of BPR3P0128 in switching transcription to replication. This reduction in mRNA expression resulted from the BPR3P-mediated inhibition of the cap-dependent endoribonuclease (cap-snatching) activities of nuclear extracts containing the influenza virus polymerase complex. No inhibition of binding of 5' viral RNA to the viral polymerase complex by this compound was detected. BPR3P0128 also effectively inhibited other RNA viruses, such as enterovirus 71 and human rhinovirus, but not DNA viruses, suggesting that BPR3P0128 targets a cellular factor(s) associated with viral PB2 cap-snatching activity. The identification of this factor(s) could help redefine the regulation of viral transcription and replication and thereby provide a potential target for antiviral chemotherapeutics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies a compound inhibiting influenza virus cap-snatching activity, focusing on antiviral mechanism rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Insights on influenza pathogenesis from the grave.
Abstract: The 1918-1919 'Spanish' influenza virus caused the worst pandemic in recorded history and resulted in approximately 50 million deaths worldwide. Efforts to understand what happened and to use these insights to prevent a future similar pandemic have been ongoing since 1918. In 2005 the genome of the 1918 influenza virus was completely determined by sequencing fragments of viral RNA preserved in autopsy tissues of 1918 victims, and using reverse genetics, infectious viruses bearing some or all the 1918 virus gene segments were reconstructed. These studies have yielded much information about the origin and pathogenicity of the 1918 virus, but many questions still remain.

Title: No association between mannose-binding lectin deficiency and H1N1 2009 infection observed during the first season of this novel pandemic influenza virus.
Abstract: Genetic variations in host immunity may influence susceptibility to novel infections like the recently emergent pandemic influenza virus. Prior studies demonstrated that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) inactivates influenza. Furthermore, MBL deficiency is common and appears to predispose to respiratory virus infections. Therefore, we studied whether MBL deficiency played a role in infection with the novel H1N1 2009 influenza strain in exposed health care workers. In a nested case-control study, we observed no association between phenotypic MBL deficiency, variously defined, and predisposition to H1N1 2009 influenza in 63 pairs of seropositive and seronegative participants. MBL appears to currently have little impact on innate immune responses to H1N1 2009 influenza.

Title: Mimotope ELISA for detection of broad spectrum antibody against avian H5N1 influenza virus.
Abstract: We have raised a panel of broad spectrum neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which neutralize the infectivity of, and afford protection against infection by, most of the major genetic groups of the virus evolved since 1997. Peptide mimics reactive with one of these broad spectrum H5N1 neutralizing antibodies, 8H5, were identified from random phage display libraries. The amino acid residues of the most reactive 12mer peptide, p125 (DTPLTTAALRLV), were randomly substituted to improve its mimicry of the natural 8H5 epitope. 133 reactive peptides with unique amino acid sequences were identified from 5 sub-libraries of p125. Four residues (2,4,5.9) of the parental peptide were preserved among all the derived peptides and probably essential for 8H5 binding. These are interspersed among four other residues (1,3,8,10), which exhibit restricted substitution and probably could contribute to binding, and another four (6,7,11,12) which could be randomly substituted and probably are not essential for binding. One peptide, V-1b, derived by substituting 5 of the latter residues is the most reactive and has a binding constant of 3.16×10(-9) M, which is 38 fold higher than the affinity of the parental p125. Immunoassay produced with this peptide is specifically reactive with 8H5 but not also the other related broad spectrum H5N1 avian influenza virus neutralizing antibodies. Serum samples from 29 chickens infected with H5N1 avian influenza virus gave a positive result by this assay and those from 12 uninfected animals gave a negative test result. The immunoassay produced with the 12 mer peptide,V1-b, is specific for the natural 8H5 epitope and can be used for detection of antibody against the broad spectrum neutralization site of H5N1 avian influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antibody detection using mimotope ELISA and peptide binding, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Impact of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine on cell-mediated rejection in heart transplant recipients.
Abstract: During the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, vaccination of high risk groups including solid-organ transplant recipients was advised. A retrospective case control study of 60 heart transplant patients, 15 having received the H1N1 virus antigen and ASO3 adjuvant vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada) within 21 days and 45 having not been vaccinated, all undergoing routine surveillance endmyocardial biopsies, was performed. The overall rate of cellular rejection (all grades) was not statistically different between groups; however, acute cellular rejection, ≥grade 2 (1990 ISHLT criteria), was more frequent among those having recently vaccinated (control: 1/45 vs. 6/15, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the only risk factor found to be associated with acute cellular rejection was recent H1N1 viral antigen and adjuvant vaccination (OR 26.5: 95% CI 02.59-270.5). Vaccine adjuvants increase host response to vaccine antigens by immune upregulation potentially increasing risk of rejection in solid-organ transplant recipients. The potential hazard of vaccination this study raises must be weighed with the clear benefit vaccination has proven to be.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study examines the impact of H1N1 vaccination on transplant rejection, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness in two cities of the tropical country of Ecuador: 2006-2010.
Abstract: Tropical countries are thought to play an important role in the global behavior of respiratory infections such as influenza. The tropical country of Ecuador has almost no documentation of the causes of acute respiratory infections. The objectives of this study were to identify the viral agents associated with influenza like illness (ILI) in Ecuador, describe what strains of influenza were circulating in the region along with their epidemiologic characteristics, and perform molecular characterization of those strains. This is a prospective surveillance study of the causes of ILI based on viral culture of oropharyngeal specimens and case report forms obtained in hospitals from two cities of Ecuador over 4 years. Out of 1,702 cases of ILI, nine viral agents were detected in 597 patients. During the time of the study, seven genetic variants of influenza circulated in Ecuador, causing six periods of increased activity. There appeared to be more heterogeneity in the cause of ILI in the tropical city of Guayaquil when compared with the Andean city of Quito. This was the most extensive documentation of the viral causes of ILI in Ecuador to date. Influenza was a common cause of ILI in Ecuador, causing more than one outbreak per year. There was no well defined influenza season although there were periods of time when no influenza was detected alternating with epidemics of different variant strains.

Title: The pathogenesis of influenza virus infections: the contributions of virus and host factors.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause acute respiratory inflammation in humans and symptoms such as high fever, body aches, and fatigue. Usually these symptoms improve after several days; however, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [influenza A(H1N1) 2009] is more pathogenic than seasonal influenza viruses and the pathogenicity of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses is still higher. The 1918 influenza pandemic virus caused severe pneumonia, resulting in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. Several virulence factors have been identified in these virus strains, but host factors are also responsible for the pathogenesis of infections caused by virulent viruses. Here, we review the contributions of both virus and host factors to the pathogenesis of these viral infections.

Title: Serum-free microcarrier based production of replication deficient influenza vaccine candidate virus lacking NS1 using Vero cells.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a major health concern that has huge impacts on the human society, and vaccination remains as one of the most effective ways to mitigate this disease. Comparing the two types of commercially available Influenza vaccine, the live attenuated virus vaccine is more cross-reactive and easier to administer than the traditional inactivated vaccines. One promising live attenuated Influenza vaccine that has completed Phase I clinical trial is deltaFLU, a deletion mutant lacking the viral Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) gene. As a consequence of this gene deletion, this mutant virus can only propagate effectively in cells with a deficient interferon-mediated antiviral response. To demonstrate the manufacturability of this vaccine candidate, a batch bioreactor production process using adherent Vero cells on microcarriers in commercially available animal-component free, serum-free media is described. Five commercially available animal-component free, serum-free media (SFM) were evaluated for growth of Vero cells in agitated Cytodex 1 spinner flask microcarrier cultures. EX-CELL Vero SFM achieved the highest cell concentration of 2.6 × 10^6 cells/ml, whereas other SFM achieved about 1.2 × 10^6 cells/ml. Time points for infection between the late exponential and stationary phases of cell growth had no significant effect in the final virus titres. A virus yield of 7.6 Log10 TCID50/ml was achieved using trypsin concentration of 10 μg/ml and MOI of 0.001. The Influenza vaccine production process was scaled up to a 3 liter controlled stirred tank bioreactor to achieve a cell density of 2.7 × 10^6 cells/ml and virus titre of 8.3 Log10 TCID50/ml. Finally, the bioreactor system was tested for the production of the corresponding wild type H1N1 Influenza virus, which is conventionally used in the production of inactivated vaccine. High virus titres of up to 10 Log10 TCID50/ml were achieved. We describe for the first time the production of Influenza viruses using Vero cells in commercially available animal-component free, serum-free medium. This work can be used as a basis for efficient production of attenuated as well as wild type Influenza virus for research and vaccine production.

Title: Location-specific patterns of exposure to recent pre-pandemic strains of influenza A in southern China.
Abstract: Variation in influenza incidence between locations is commonly observed on large spatial scales. It is unclear whether such variation occurs on smaller spatial scales and whether it is the result of heterogeneities in population demographics or more subtle differences in population structure and connectivity. Here we show that significant differences in immunity to influenza A viruses among communities in China are not explained by differences in population demographics. We randomly selected households from five randomly selected locations near Guangzhou, China to answer a questionnaire and provide a blood sample for serological testing against five recently circulating influenza viruses. We find a significant reduction in the frequency of detectable neutralization titers with increasing age, levelling off in older age groups. There are significant differences between locations in age, employment status, vaccination history, household size and housing conditions. However, after adjustment, significant variations in the frequency of detectable neutralization titers persists between locations. These results suggest there are characteristics of communities that drive influenza transmission dynamics apart from individual and household level risk factors, and that such factors have effects independent of strain.
Relevant: False
Reason: This epidemiological study examines variation in immunity and exposure but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibitory effect and possible mechanism of action of patchouli alcohol against influenza A (H2N2) virus.
Abstract: In the present study, the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchouli alcohol was studied in vitro, in vivo and in silico. The CC₅₀ of patchouli alcohol was above 20 µM. Patchouli alcohol could inhibit influenza virus with an IC₅₀ of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. MTT assay showed that the inhibition by patchouli alcohol appears strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. In the influenza mouse model, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the viral infection at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Flexible docking and molecular dynamic simulations indicated that patchouli alcohol was bound to the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus, with an interaction energy of -40.38 kcal mol⁻¹. The invariant key active-site residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 played important roles during the binding process. Based on spatial and energetic criteria, patchouli alcohol interfered with the NA functions. Results presented here suggest that patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus properties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-influenza agents for the pharmaceutical industry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the inhibitory effect of patchouli alcohol on influenza A (H2N2) virus and its mechanism, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 3 is involved in influenza A virus replication in human lung epithelial (A549) cells.
Abstract: Influenza A virus mutates rapidly, rendering antiviral therapies and vaccines directed against virus-encoded targets ineffective. Knowledge of the host factors and molecular pathways exploited by influenza virus will provide further targets for novel antiviral strategies. However, the critical host factors involved in influenza virus infection have not been fully defined. We demonstrated that LAMP3, a member of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP) family, was significantly induced in human lung epithelial (A549) cells upon influenza A virus infection. Knockdown of LAMP3 expression by RNA interference attenuated production of viral nucleoprotein (NP) as well as virus titers. Confocal microscopy results demonstrated that viral NP is colocalized within LAMP3 positive vesicles at early stages of virus infection. Furthermore, knockdown of LAMP3 expression led to a reduction in nuclear accumulation of viral NP and impeded virus replication. LAMP3 is an influenza A virus inducible gene, and plays an important role in viral post-entry steps. Our observations may provide insights into the mechanism of influenza virus replication and potential targets for novel anti-influenza therapeutics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of a host factor (LAMP3) in influenza A virus replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus infection induces cellular Ebp1 gene expression.
Abstract: Influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is composed of three viral proteins, PB1, PB2, and PA. The host protein Ebp1 (ErbB3-binding protein1) interacts with PB1, and inhibits both in vitro RNA synthesis and virus replication. On Western blotting, the induction of Ebp1 was observed after influenza virus infection. To understand the induction of Ebp1 by influenza virus infection, we introduced a series of deletions within the 981-nucleotide long sequence located upstream of the Ebp1 gene (-664 to +317 nt from the transcription initiation site) and ligated them to the GFP gene. GFP expression assays indicated that the 981-nt upstream region was required for expression of GFP in not all cells but some cells. Microscopic analysis of the transformants showed that GFP expression was up-regulated by the influenza virus infection. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR indicated that influenza virus infection induced Ebp1 mRNA expression. Our data showed that (i) the newly synthesized vRNP of influenza virus induces Ebp1 expression; (ii) the Ebp1 promoter localizes between -664 nt and the initiation site of the Ebp1 gene, +317-nt long sequence in the noncoding region is required for regulation of Ebp1 gene expression; and (iii) Ebp1 expression level is correlated with virus protein expression level.
Relevant: False

Title: Cold-adapted influenza and recombinant adenovirus vaccines induce cross-protective immunity against pH1N1 challenge in mice.
Abstract: The rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pH1N1) highlighted problems associated with relying on strain-matched vaccines. A lengthy process of strain identification, manufacture, and testing is required for current strain-matched vaccines and delays vaccine availability. Vaccines inducing immunity to conserved viral proteins could be manufactured and tested in advance and provide cross-protection against novel influenza viruses until strain-matched vaccines became available. Here we test two prototype vaccines for cross-protection against the recent pandemic virus. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were intranasally immunized with a single dose of cold-adapted (ca) influenza viruses from 1977 or recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing 1934 nucleoprotein (NP) and consensus matrix 2 (M2) (NP+M2-rAd). Antibodies against the M2 ectodomain (M2e) were seen in NP+M2-rAd immunized BALB/c but not C57BL/6 mice, and cross-reacted with pH1N1 M2e. The ca-immunized mice did not develop antibodies against M2e. Despite sequence differences between vaccine and challenge virus NP and M2e epitopes, extensive cross-reactivity of lung T cells with pH1N1 peptides was detected following immunization. Both ca and NP+M2-rAd immunization protected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice against challenge with a mouse-adapted pH1N1 virus. Cross-protective vaccines such as NP+M2-rAd and ca virus are effective against pH1N1 challenge within 3 weeks of immunization. Protection was not dependent on recognition of the highly variable external viral proteins and could be achieved with a single vaccine dose. The rAd vaccine was superior to the ca vaccine by certain measures, justifying continued investigation of this experimental vaccine even though ca vaccine is already available. This study highlights the potential for cross-protective vaccines as a public health option early in an influenza pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates vaccine-induced cross-protective immunity against pH1N1 challenge but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Strength and tempo of selection revealed in viral gene genealogies.
Abstract: RNA viruses evolve extremely quickly, allowing them to rapidly adapt to new environmental conditions. Viral pathogens, such as influenza virus, exploit this capacity for evolutionary change to persist within the human population despite substantial immune pressure. Understanding the process of adaptation in these viral systems is essential to our efforts to combat infectious disease. Through analysis of simulated populations and sequence data from influenza A (H3N2) and measles virus, we show how phylogenetic and population genetic techniques can be used to assess the strength and temporal pattern of adaptive evolution. The action of natural selection affects the shape of the genealogical tree connecting members of an evolving population, causing deviations from the neutral expectation. The magnitude and distribution of these deviations lends insight into the historical pattern of evolution and adaptation in the viral population. We quantify the degree of ongoing adaptation in influenza and measles virus through comparison of census population size and effective population size inferred from genealogical patterns, finding a 60-fold greater deviation in influenza than in measles. We also examine the tempo of adaptation in influenza, finding evidence for both continuous and episodic change. Our results have important consequences for understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of the influenza virus. Additionally, these general techniques may prove useful to assess the strength and pattern of adaptive evolution in a variety of evolving systems. They are especially powerful when assessing selection in fast-evolving populations, where temporal patterns become highly visible.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses phylogenetic and population genetic techniques to study viral adaptation but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Drosophila model for genetic analysis of influenza viral/host interactions.
Abstract: Influenza viruses impose a constant threat to vertebrates susceptible to this family of viruses. We have developed a new tool to study virus-host interactions that play key roles in viral replication and to help identify novel anti-influenza drug targets. Via the UAS/Gal4 system we ectopically expressed the influenza virus M2 gene in Drosophila melanogaster and generated dose-sensitive phenotypes in the eye and wing. We have confirmed that the M2 proton channel is properly targeted to cell membranes in Drosophila tissues and functions as a proton channel by altering intracellular pH. As part of the efficacy for potential anti-influenza drug screens, we have also demonstrated that the anti-influenza drug amantadine, which targets the M2 proton channel, suppressed the UAS-M2 mutant phenotype when fed to larvae. In a candidate gene screen we identified mutations in components of the vacuolar V1V0 ATPase that modify the UAS-M2 phenotype. Importantly, in this study we demonstrate that Drosophila genetic interactions translate directly to physiological requirements of the influenza A virus for these components in mammalian cells. Overexpressing specific V1 subunits altered the replication capacity of influenza virus in cell culture and suggests that drugs targeting the enzyme complex via these subunits may be useful in anti-influenza drug therapies. Moreover, this study adds credence to the idea of using the M2 "flu fly" to identify new and previously unconsidered cellular genes as potential drug targets and to provide insight into basic mechanisms of influenza virus biology.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses a Drosophila model to analyze influenza viral/host interactions focusing on host factors and drug effects, without explicit genotype-phenotype links for the virus.

Title: Ocular tropism of influenza A viruses: identification of H7 subtype-specific host responses in human respiratory and ocular cells.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7 virus infection in humans frequently results in conjunctivitis as a major symptom. However, our understanding of what properties govern virus subtype-specific tropism, and of the host responses responsible for eliciting ocular inflammation and pathogenicity following influenza virus infection, are not well understood. To study virus-host interactions in ocular tissue, we infected primary human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells with H7, H5, and H1 subtype viruses. We found that numerous virus subtypes were capable of infecting and replicating in multiple human ocular cell types, with the highest titers observed with highly pathogenic H7N7 and H5N1 viruses. Similar patterns of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production following influenza virus infection were observed in ocular and respiratory cells. However, primary ocular cells infected with HPAI H7N7 viruses were found to have elevated levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a cytokine previously implicated in ocular disease pathology. Furthermore, H7N7 virus infection of corneal epithelial cells resulted in enhanced and significant increases in the expression of genes related to NF-κB signal transduction compared with that after H5N1 or H1N1 virus infection. The differential induction of cytokines and signaling pathways in human ocular cells following H7 virus infection marks the first association of H7 subtype-specific host responses with ocular tropism and pathogenicity. In particular, heightened expression of genes related to NF-κB-mediated signaling transduction following HPAI H7N7 virus infection in primary corneal epithelial cells, but not respiratory cells, identifies activation of a signaling pathway that correlates with the ocular tropism of influenza viruses within this subtype.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host responses to different influenza A virus subtypes in ocular cells, focusing on host gene expression and cytokine induction rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza emergence in the face of evolutionary constraints.
Abstract: Different influenza subtypes can evolve at very different rates, but the causes are not well understood. In this paper, we explore whether differences in transmissibility between subtypes can play a role if there are fitness constraints on antigenic evolution. We investigate the problem using a mathematical model that separates the interaction of strains through cross-immunity from the process of emergence for new antigenic variants. Evolutionary constraints are also included with antigenic mutation incurring a fitness cost. We show that the transmissibility of a strain can become disproportionately important in dictating the rate of antigenic drift: strains that spread only slightly more easily can have a much higher rate of emergence. Further, we see that the effect continues when vaccination is considered; a small increase in the rate of transmission can make it much harder to control the frequency at which new strains emerge. Our results not only highlight the importance of considering both transmission and fitness constraints when modelling influenza evolution, but may also help in understanding the differences between the emergence of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models influenza emergence and evolution considering fitness constraints and transmissibility but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: IPMiner: a progenitor gene identifier for influenza A virus.
Abstract: Identification of the genetic origin of influenza A viruses will facilitate understanding of the genomic dynamics, evolutionary pathway, and viral fitness of influenza A viruses. The exponential increases of influenza sequences have expanded the coverage of influenza genetic pool, thus potentially reducing the biases for influenza progenitor identification. However, these large amounts of data generate a great challenge in progenitor identification. To increase computational efficiency, IPMiner is developed by integrating complete composition vector for genetic distance calculation and minimum spanning tree algorithm for progenitor identification. IPMiner is available to at http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/IPMiner.

Title: Memory B cells and CD8⁺ lymphocytes do not control seasonal influenza A virus replication after homologous re-challenge of rhesus macaques.
Abstract: This study sought to define the role of memory lymphocytes in the protection from homologous influenza A virus re-challenge in rhesus macaques. Depleting monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were administered to the animals prior to their second experimental inoculation with a human seasonal influenza A virus strain. Treatment with either anti-CD8α or anti-CD20 mAbs prior to re-challenge had minimal effect on influenza A virus replication. Thus, in non-human primates with pre-existing anti-influenza A antibodies, memory B cells and CD8α⁺ T cells do not contribute to the control of virus replication after re-challenge with a homologous strain of influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune cell roles in virus replication control, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Influenza A viruses: new research developments.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are zoonotic pathogens that continuously circulate and change in several animal hosts, including birds, pigs, horses and humans. The emergence of novel virus strains that are capable of causing human epidemics or pandemics is a serious possibility. Here, we discuss the value of surveillance and characterization of naturally occurring influenza viruses, and review the impact that new developments in the laboratory have had on our understanding of the host tropism and virulence of viruses. We also revise the lessons that have been learnt from the pandemic viruses of the past 100 years.

Title: A highly conserved neutralizing epitope on group 2 influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Current flu vaccines provide only limited coverage against seasonal strains of influenza viruses. The identification of V(H)1-69 antibodies that broadly neutralize almost all influenza A group 1 viruses constituted a breakthrough in the influenza field. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody CR8020 with broad neutralizing activity against most group 2 viruses, including H3N2 and H7N7, which cause severe human infection. The crystal structure of Fab CR8020 with the 1968 pandemic H3 hemagglutinin (HA) reveals a highly conserved epitope in the HA stalk distinct from the epitope recognized by the V(H)1-69 group 1 antibodies. Thus, a cocktail of two antibodies may be sufficient to neutralize most influenza A subtypes and, hence, enable development of a universal flu vaccine and broad-spectrum antibody therapies.

Title: Rapid detection of the H275Y oseltamivir resistance mutation in influenza A/H1N1 2009 by single base pair RT-PCR and high-resolution melting.
Abstract: We aimed to design a real-time reverse-transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR), high-resolution melting (HRM) assay to detect the H275Y mutation that confers oseltamivir resistance in influenza A/H1N1 2009 viruses. A novel strategy of amplifying a single base pair, the relevant SNP at position 823 of the neuraminidase gene, was chosen to maintain specificity of the assay. Wildtype and mutant virus were differentiated when using known reference samples of cell-cultured virus. However, when dilutions of these reference samples were assayed, amplification of non-specific primer-dimer was evident and affected the overall melting temperature (T(m)) of the amplified products. Due to primer-dimer appearance at >30 cycles we found that if the cycle threshold (C(T)) for a dilution was >30, the HRM assay did not consistently discriminate mutant from wildtype. Where the C(T) was <30 we noted an inverse relationship between C(T) and T(m) and fitted quadratic curves allowed the discrimination of wildtype, mutant and 30∶70 mutant∶wildtype virus mixtures. We compared the C(T) values for a TaqMan H1N1 09 detection assay with those for the HRM assay using 59 clinical samples and demonstrated that samples with a TaqMan detection assay C(T)>32.98 would have an H275Y assay C(T)>30. Analysis of the TaqMan C(T) values for 609 consecutive clinical samples predicted that 207 (34%) of the samples would result in an HRM assay C(T)>30 and therefore not be amenable to the HRM assay. The use of single base pair PCR and HRM can be useful for specifically interrogating SNPs. When applied to H1N1 09, the constraints this placed on primer design resulted in amplification of primer-dimer products. The impact primer-dimer had on HRM curves was adjusted for by plotting T(m) against C(T). Although less sensitive than TaqMan assays, the HRM assay can rapidly, and at low cost, screen samples with moderate viral concentrations.

Title: Comprehensive proteomic analysis of influenza virus polymerase complex reveals a novel association with mitochondrial proteins and RNA polymerase accessory factors.
Abstract: The trimeric RNA polymerase complex (3P, for PA-PB1-PB2) of influenza A virus (IAV) is an important viral determinant of pathogenicity and host range restriction. Specific interactions of the polymerase complex with host proteins may be determining factors in both of these characteristics and play important roles in the viral life cycle. To investigate this question, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of human host proteins associated with the polymerase of the well-characterized H5N1 Vietnam/1203/04 isolate. We identified over 400 proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), of which over 300 were found to bind to the PA subunit alone. The most intriguing and novel finding was the large number of mitochondrial proteins (∼20%) that associated with the PA subunit. These proteins mediate molecular transport across the mitochondrial membrane or regulate membrane potential and may in concert with the identified mitochondrion-associated apoptosis inducing factor (AIFM1) have roles in the induction of apoptosis upon association with PA. Additionally, we identified host factors that associated with the PA-PB1 (68 proteins) and/or the 3P complex (34 proteins) including proteins that have roles in innate antiviral signaling (e.g., ZAPS or HaxI) or are cellular RNA polymerase accessory factors (e.g., polymerase I transcript release factor [PTRF] or Supt5H). IAV strain-specific host factor binding to the polymerase was not observed in our analysis. Overall, this study has shed light into the complex contributions of the IAV polymerase to host cell pathogenicity and allows for direct investigations into the biological significance of these newly described interactions.

Title: The aminobisphosphonate pamidronate controls influenza pathogenesis by expanding a gammadelta T cell population in humanized mice.
Abstract: There are few antiviral drugs for treating influenza, and the emergence of antiviral resistance has further limited the available therapeutic options. Furthermore, antivirals are not invariably effective in severe influenza, such as that caused by H5N1 viruses. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded by the aminobisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) kill influenza virus-infected cells and inhibit viral replication in vitro. In Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human peripheral mononuclear cells (huPBMCs), PAM reduces disease severity and mortality caused by human seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza virus, and controls the lung inflammation and viral replication. PAM has no such effects in influenza virus-infected Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) mice reconstituted with Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-depleted huPBMCs. Our study provides proof-of-concept of a novel therapeutic strategy for treating influenza by targeting the host rather than the virus, thereby reducing the opportunity for the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. As PAM has been commonly used to treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease, this new application of an old drug potentially offers a safe and readily available option for treating influenza.

Title: Purifying selection can obscure the ancient age of viral lineages.
Abstract: Statistical methods for molecular dating of viral origins have been used extensively to infer the time of most common recent ancestor for many rapidly evolving pathogens. However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses molecular dating and purifying selection effects on viral lineage age estimation, not direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Expression of duck CCL19 and CCL21 and CCR7 receptor in lymphoid and influenza-infected tissues.
Abstract: Ducks are the natural host and reservoir of influenza viruses. We are interested in their immune responses to these viruses, to understand host-pathogen interactions and to develop effective agricultural vaccines. We identified duck homologues of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 and cloned their cognate receptor, CCR7. Conservation of key features, and expression in lymphoid tissues suggests that these chemokines are the direct orthologues of their mammalian counterparts. Mammalian CCL19 and CCL21 are responsible for the homing of dendritic cells and naïve lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues. The contribution of local tertiary lymphoid tissues may be important during influenza infection in ducks. Consistent with leukocyte recruitment, CCL19 and CCL21 transcripts are abundant in lung tissues at 1 day post-infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) (VN1203). In contrast, expression in lung or intestine tissues infected with low pathogenic A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) (BC500) is not significant. Recruitment and aggregation of leukocytes is visible in the vicinity of major airways 3 days after infection with VN1203. Chemokine gene expression may serve as a useful marker to evaluate duck immune responses to natural infections and vaccine strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune gene expression in response to infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Influenza A virus nucleoprotein exploits Hsp40 to inhibit PKR activation.
Abstract: Double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a key regulator of the anti-viral innate immune response in mammalian cells. PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo Dalton cellular inhibitor (P58(IPK)), which is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. In case of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, P58(IPK) is known to dissociate from Hsp40 and inhibit PKR activation. However the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58(IPK) activation was hitherto unknown. Human heat shock 40 protein (Hsp40) was identified as an interacting partner of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (IAV NP) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies from mammalian cells transfected with IAV NP expressing plasmid. Further, the IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction was validated in mammalian cells infected with various seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Cellular localization studies showed that NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. During IAV infection in mammalian cells, expression of NP coincided with the dissociation of P58(IPK) from Hsp40 and decrease PKR phosphorylation. We observed that, plasmid based expression of NP in mammalian cells leads to decrease in PKR phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus replication led to PKR activation and concomitant increase in eIF2α phosphorylation. Inhibition of NP expression also led to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation, enhanced IFN β production and concomitant reduction of virus replication. Taken together our data suggest that NP is the viral factor responsible for P58(IPK) activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of IAV NP in inhibiting PKR-mediated anti-viral host response and help us understand P58(IPK) mediated inhibition of PKR activity during IAV infection.

Title: Extensive geographic mosaicism in avian influenza viruses from gulls in the northern hemisphere.
Abstract: Due to limited interaction of migratory birds between Eurasia and America, two independent avian influenza virus (AIV) gene pools have evolved. There is evidence of low frequency reassortment between these regions, which has major implications in global AIV dynamics. Indeed, all currently circulating lineages of the PB1 and PA segments in North America are of Eurasian origin. Large-scale analyses of intercontinental reassortment have shown that viruses isolated from Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, and shorebirds) are the major contributor of these outsider events. To clarify the role of gulls in AIV dynamics, specifically in movement of genes between geographic regions, we have sequenced six gull AIV isolated in Alaska and analyzed these along with 142 other available gull virus sequences. Basic investigations of host species and the locations and times of isolation reveal biases in the available sequence information. Despite these biases, our analyses reveal a high frequency of geographic reassortment in gull viruses isolated in America. This intercontinental gene mixing is not found in the viruses isolated from gulls in Eurasia. This study demonstrates that gulls are important as vectors for geographically reassorted viruses, particularly in America, and that more surveillance effort should be placed on this group of birds.

Abstract: The emergence and rapid global spread of the swine-origin H1N1/09 pandemic influenza A virus in humans underscores the importance of swine populations as reservoirs for genetically diverse influenza viruses with the potential to infect humans. However, despite their significance for animal and human health, relatively little is known about the phylogeography of swine influenza viruses in the United States. This study utilizes an expansive data set of hemagglutinin (HA1) sequences (n = 1516) from swine influenza viruses collected in North America during the period 2003-2010. With these data we investigate the spatial dissemination of a novel influenza virus of the H1 subtype that was introduced into the North American swine population via two separate human-to-swine transmission events around 2003. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis reveals that the spatial dissemination of this influenza virus in the US swine population follows long-distance swine movements from the Southern US to the Midwest, a corn-rich commercial center that imports millions of swine annually. Hence, multiple genetically diverse influenza viruses are introduced and co-circulate in the Midwest, providing the opportunity for genomic reassortment. Overall, the Midwest serves primarily as an ecological sink for swine influenza in the US, with sources of virus genetic diversity instead located in the Southeast (mainly North Carolina) and South-central (mainly Oklahoma) regions. Understanding the importance of long-distance pig transportation in the evolution and spatial dissemination of the influenza virus in swine may inform future strategies for the surveillance and control of influenza, and perhaps other swine pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on spatial dynamics and phylogeography of swine influenza viruses, not explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: PhyloMap: an algorithm for visualizing relationships of large sequence data sets and its application to the influenza A virus genome.
Abstract: Results of phylogenetic analysis are often visualized as phylogenetic trees. Such a tree can typically only include up to a few hundred sequences. When more than a few thousand sequences are to be included, analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among them becomes a challenging task. The recent frequent outbreaks of influenza A viruses have resulted in the rapid accumulation of corresponding genome sequences. Currently, there are more than 7500 influenza A virus genomes in the database. There are no efficient ways of representing this huge data set as a whole, thus preventing a further understanding of the diversity of the influenza A virus genome. Here we present a new algorithm, "PhyloMap", which combines ordination, vector quantization, and phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant representation of a large sequence data set. The use of PhyloMap on influenza A virus genome sequences reveals the phylogenetic relationships of the internal genes that cannot be seen when only a subset of sequences are analyzed. The application of PhyloMap to influenza A virus genome data shows that it is a robust algorithm for analyzing large sequence data sets. It utilizes the entire data set, minimizes bias, and provides intuitive visualization. PhyloMap is implemented in JAVA, and the source code is freely available at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/public/software/phylomap.html.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a computational method for visualizing large sequence data sets, not direct genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Serological memory and long-term protection to novel H1N1 influenza virus after skin vaccination.
Abstract: A major goal in influenza vaccine development is induction of serological memory and cellular responses to confer long-term protection and limit virus spread after infection. Here, we investigate induction of long-lived immunity against the 2009 H1N1 virus after skin vaccination. BALB/c mice received a single dose of 5 μg inactivated A/California/04/09 virus via coated metal microneedles (MN) applied to skin or via subcutaneous injection. MN or subcutaneous vaccination elicited similar serum IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers and 100% protection against lethal viral challenge 6 weeks after vaccination. Six months after vaccination, the subcutaneous group exhibited a 60% decrease in functional antibody titers and extensive lung inflammation after challenge with 10 × LD(50) of homologous virus. In contrast, the MN group maintained high functional antibody titers and IFN-γ levels, inhibition of viral replication, and no signs of lung inflammation after challenge. MN vaccination conferred complete protection against lethal challenge, whereas subcutaneous vaccination induced only partial protection. These findings were further supported by high numbers of bone marrow plasma cells and spleen antibody-secreting cells detected in the MN group. A single skin vaccination with MN induced potent long-lived immunity and improved protection against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, compared with subcutaneous injection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on vaccine-induced immunity and protection, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: The cellular RNA helicase UAP56 is required for prevention of double-stranded RNA formation during influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The cellular DEAD box RNA helicase UAP56 plays a pivotal role in the efficient transcription/replication of influenza A virus. UAP56 is recruited by the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A viruses, and recent data revealed that the RNA helicase is required for the nuclear export of a subset of spliced and unspliced viral mRNAs. The fact that influenza viruses do not produce detectable amounts of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates during transcription/replication suggests the involvement of cellular RNA helicases. Hence, we examined whether the RNA-unwinding activity of UAP56 or its paralog URH49 plays a role in preventing the accumulation of dsRNA during infection. First, our data showed that not only UAP56 but also its paralog URH49 can interact with NPs of avian and human influenza A viruses. The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of either RNA helicase reduced the transport of M1 and hemagglutinin (HA) mRNAs and, to a lesser extent, NP and NS1 mRNAs into the cytoplasm. Moreover, we found that virus infection of UAP56-depleted cells leads to the rapid accumulation of dsRNA in the perinuclear region. In parallel, we observed a robust virus-mediated activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), indicating that the cellular RNA helicase UAP56 may be recruited by influenza virus to prevent dsRNA formation. The accumulation of dsRNA was blocked when actinomycin D or cycloheximide was used to inhibit viral transcription/replication or translation, respectively. In summary, we demonstrate that UAP56 is utilized by influenza A viruses to prevent the formation of dsRNA and, hence, the activation of the innate immune response.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on the role of a cellular RNA helicase in influenza virus replication and immune evasion, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic: was there a difference in the two waves in patients requiring admission to the intensive-care unit?
Abstract: Influenza virus is prone to mutations that may alter the intensity of subsequent waves of infection. In this study, we evaluated whether outcomes were different in the two waves of the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic in patients admitted to the intensive-care unit. Age, gender, lag-time to presentation and APACHE-II scores were similar in both waves. Although ventilatory requirements were similar (36/37 vs. 36/39), non-significant reductions in the durations (days) of ventilation (10.3 ± 8.0 vs. 7.8 ± 9.4, p 0.11) and hospitalization (14.9 ± 10.5 vs. 12.3 ± 14.1, p 0.20) were observed in the second wave. The clinical profile and outcomes were not significantly different between the two waves among severely ill patients.
Relevant: False
Reason: Compares clinical outcomes between two waves of H1N1 pandemic without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenicity H5N1 and H7N3 influenza A virus isolates recovered from sentinel, free flying, wild mallards at one study site during 2006.
Abstract: From August 2 to October 11, 2006, clusters of low pathogenicity (LP) North American lineage H5N1 and H7N3 avian influenza A viruses (AIV), and other subtypes, were recovered from free-flying, resident, wild mallards used as sentinels at one site. The antigenic subtypes, pathogenicity potential, and Sanger sequencing of the isolates determined the H5N1 and H7N3 isolates were only recovered from samples collected on 8/2/2006 and 9/8/2006, respectively. However, subsequent efforts using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and additional Sanger sequencing found partial H7 segments in other HA-NA virus combinations on 8/2/2006, 9/8/2006 and 10/11/2006. It is well established that over larger geographic areas and years AIVs form transient genomic constellations; this sequential sampling data revealed that over a short period of time the dynamics of AIVs can be active and newer sequencing platforms increase recognition of mixed infections. Both findings provide further insight into the natural history of AIVs in natural reservoirs.

Reason: Focuses on phylogenetic and sequencing analysis of avian influenza viruses without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Glycyrrhizin exerts antioxidative effects in H5N1 influenza A virus-infected cells and inhibits virus replication and pro-inflammatory gene expression.
Abstract: Glycyrrhizin is known to exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, the effects of an approved parenteral glycyrrhizin preparation (Stronger Neo-Minophafen C) were investigated on highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 virus replication, H5N1-induced apoptosis, and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial (A549) cells. Therapeutic glycyrrhizin concentrations substantially inhibited H5N1-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules CXCL10, interleukin 6, CCL2, and CCL5 (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 25 to 50 µg/ml) but interfered with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced apoptosis to a lesser extent (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 100 µg/ml or higher). Glycyrrhizin also diminished monocyte migration towards supernatants of H5N1-infected A549 cells. The mechanism by which glycyrrhizin interferes with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression includes inhibition of H5N1-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and (in turn) reduced activation of NFκB, JNK, and p38, redox-sensitive signalling events known to be relevant for influenza A virus replication. Therefore, glycyrrhizin may complement the arsenal of potential drugs for the treatment of H5N1 disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin on H5N1 virus replication and host responses, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Duration of viral shedding in hospitalized patients infected with pandemic H1N1.
Abstract: The first influenza pandemic of the 21th century was ignited by a new strain of influenza A virus (A/H1N1pdm). Specific patient groups, including those with comorbidities, pregnant women, young children, older and immunocompromised patients, are at increased risk for serious influenza-related disease. This study was aimed at investigating the influence of clinical presentation, antiviral treatment and possible drug resistance-associated mutations, on the extent and duration of viral shedding in patients infected with A/H1N1pdm. An observational study was performed, based on retrospective review of clinical and laboratory records of patients who were hospitalized for A/H1N1pdm infection at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "L. Spallanzani", Rome, Italy, between April 24 and December 31, 2009. Among 119 hospitalized patients, 39 were selected for a post hoc analysis, based on the availability of serial nasopharyngeal swabs samples and related information. Eleven out of the 39 study patients (28.2%) presented with pneumonia; 29 (74.4%) received antiviral treatment. Patients with pneumonia were significantly older than patients without pneumonia. The mean values of viral RNA concentration were not significantly increased in patients with pneumonia, but a significant increase in the duration of viral shedding was observed as compared to patients without pneumonia. In patients receiving antivirals, the viral RNA concentration was significantly reduced in comparison to untreated patients at days 4-5 after symptom onset, while the overall duration of viral shedding was only marginally affected. A significant correlation between duration of viral shedding and time elapsed between symptom onset and therapy start was observed, with a significant reduction of days of viral shedding when therapy was initiated within 2 days of symptoms appearance. No known drug resistance mutations were detected in patients with prolonged viral shedding. Our results show that severe respiratory illness is associated with delayed virus clearance in patients with A/H1N1pdm infection. Antivirals caused an early reduction of viral load, but only marginally affected the overall duration of shedding. Prolonged shedding was not associated with the emergence of strains carrying known drug-resistance mutations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates clinical factors influencing viral shedding duration and antiviral treatment effects, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Aprotinin, a protease inhibitor, suppresses proteolytic activation of pandemic H1N1v influenza virus.
Abstract: The recent emergence of pandemic influenza virus H1N1v stresses the need for the development of new anti-influenza drugs. Host proteases responsible for viral haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage are attractive targets for such drugs. Aprotinin, a natural 58-amino-acid polypeptide from bovine lungs, was chosen for this purpose because it is a drug already approved for human use as an antiprotease compound to treat pancreatitis and bleeding, and because it inhibits a wide spectrum of serine proteases, some of which are involved in influenza virus activation. First, we show that HA of pandemic H1N1v was intensively cleaved and activated in different host systems (human tracheo-bronchial epithelium, human intestinal Caco-2 cells and chicken embryonated eggs). Second, aprotinin inhibited HA cleavage and replication of pandemic influenza virus H1N1v in all host systems, including human tracheo-bronchial epithelium. Third, aprotinin did not induce any apparent toxic side effects in these hosts. Aprotinin can be considered a promising drug against the novel H1N1v pandemic influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of aprotinin on viral HA cleavage and replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Peptide inhibitors against influenza virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a particularly problematic virus because of its ability to cause high levels of morbidity on a global scale within a remarkably short period of time. It also has the potential to kill very large numbers of people as occurred in the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918. Options for antiviral therapy are limited because of the paucity of available drugs and the rapid mutation rate of the virus leading to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The current H1N1 pandemic and potential threats posed by other strains highlight the need to develop novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Here, we summarize the current state and recent developments of peptide-based inhibitors of influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review summarizing peptide inhibitors against influenza virus, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Extensive geographical mixing of 2009 human H1N1 influenza A virus in a single university community.
Abstract: Despite growing interest in the molecular epidemiology of influenza virus, the pattern of viral spread within individual communities remains poorly understood. To determine the phylogeography of influenza virus in a single population, we examined the spatial diffusion of H1N1/09 influenza A virus within the student body of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), sampling for a 1-month period between October and November 2009. Despite the highly focused nature of our study, an analysis of complete viral genome sequences revealed between 24 and 33 independent introductions of H1N1/09 into the UCSD community, comprising much of the global genetic diversity in this virus. These data were also characterized by a relatively low level of on-campus transmission as well as extensive spatial mixing, such that there was little geographical clustering by either student residence or city ZIP code. Most notably, students experiencing illness on the same day and residing in the same dorm possessed phylogenetically distinct lineages. H1N1/09 influenza A virus is therefore characterized by a remarkable spatial fluidity, which is likely to impede community-based methods for its control, including class cancellations, quarantine, and chemoprophylaxis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on viral spread and phylogeography within a community, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Biophysical analysis of influenza A virus RNA promoter at physiological temperatures.
Abstract: Each segment of the influenza A virus (IAV) genome contains conserved sequences at the 5'- and 3'-terminal ends, which form the promoter region necessary for polymerase binding and initiation of RNA synthesis. Although several models of interaction have been proposed it remains unclear if these two short, partially complementary, and highly conserved sequences can form a stable RNA duplex at physiological temperatures. First, our time-resolved FRET analysis revealed that a 14-mer 3'-RNA and a 15-mer 5'-RNA associate in solution, even at 42 °C. We also found that a nonfunctional RNA promoter containing the 3'-G3U mutation, as well as a promoter containing the compensatory 3'-G3U/C8A mutations, was able to form a duplex as efficiently as wild type. Second, UV melting analysis demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant RNA duplexes have similar stabilities in solution. We also observed an increase in thermostability for a looped promoter structure. The absence of differences in the stability and binding kinetics between wild type and a nonfunctional sequence suggests that the IAV promoter can be functionally inactivated without losing the capability to form a stable RNA duplex. Finally, using uridine specific chemical probing combined with mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the 5' and 3' sequences form a duplex which protects both RNAs from chemical modification, consistent with the previously published panhandle structure. These data support that these short, conserved promoter sequences form a stable complex at physiological temperatures, and this complex likely is important for polymerase recognition and viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes biophysical properties of influenza RNA promoter sequences but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Defective interfering virus protects elderly mice from influenza.
Abstract: We have identified and characterised a defective-interfering (DI) influenza A virus particles containing a highly deleted segment 1 RNA that has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In young adult mice it exerts protection against several different subtypes of influenza A virus (defined here as homologous or genetically compatible protection) and against a paramyxovirus and an influenza B virus (heterologous or genetically unrelated protection). Homologous protection is mediated by replication competition between the deleted and full-length genomes, and heterologous protection occurs through stimulation of innate immunity, especially interferon type I. A single dose of the protective DI virus was administered intranasally to elderly mice at -7, -1 and +1 days relative to intranasal challenge with influenza A virus. A single dose of the DI virus given 1 or 7 days protected elderly mice, reducing a severe, sometimes fatal disease to a subclinical or mild infection. In contrast, all members of control groups treated with inactivated DI virus before challenge became extremely ill and most died. Despite the subclinical/mild nature of their infection, protected mice developed solid immunity to a second infectious challenge. The defective interfering virus is effective in preventing severe influenza A in elderly mice and may offer a new approach to protection of the human population.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the protective effect of defective interfering virus particles against influenza in elderly mice, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The curse of the Pharaoh revisited: evolutionary bi-stability in environmentally transmitted pathogens.
Abstract: It is increasingly evident that for a number of high-profile pathogens, transmission involves both direct and environmental pathways. Much of the distinguished evolutionary theory has, however, focused on each of transmission component separately. Herein, we use the framework of adaptive dynamics to study the evolutionary consequences of mixed transmission. We find that environmental transmission can select for increased virulence when direct transmission is low. Increasing the efficiency of direct transmission gives rise to an evolutionary bi-stability, with coexistence of different levels of virulence. We conclude that the overlooked contribution of environmental transmission may explain the curious appearance of high virulence in pathogens that are typically only moderately pathogenic, as observed for avian influenza viruses and cholera.
Relevant: False
Reason: This theoretical paper models evolutionary dynamics of virulence in pathogens with environmental transmission, without explicit empirical links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Prolonged lymphopenia in a patient with lymphoma and severe Pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 virus infection.
Abstract: To describe the clinical course of a confirmed influenza A Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in a patient with lymphoblastic lymphoma on chemotherapy. Case report. Instituto Nacional de Cancerología located in Mexico City, a national referral center for cancer patients. A 15-year-old boy, with lymphoblastic lymphoma on chemotherapy. Oseltamivir 75 mg BID was started within 24 hour of first symptoms. The patient developed respiratory failure despite oseltamivir therapy; he presented a prolonged clinical course with severe lymphopenia and deteriorated every time oseltamivir was stopped while lymphopenia persisted. Oseltamivir was reassumed twice; in the second course, rimatadine was added. Genetic study of the virus showed 100% identity for AH1N1SW, and no H274Y mutation for oseltamivir resistance was found. Clinical recovery was apparent until he presented lymphocyte reconstitution after 35 days of disease while still on antiviral therapy. This case exemplifies the need to sustain antiviral therapy while patient continues with severe lymphopenia. Lymphocyte count could be used as a surrogate marker to prolong antiviral therapy in patients with severe lymphopenia and clinically symptomatic Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. This case also highlights the importance of treating patients based on clinical grounds and the variability of rRt-PCR test for H1N1.

Title: Origins and evolutionary genomics of the novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans--past and present perspectives.
Abstract: Swine influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics claiming the lives of millions from the early history up to the present days. This virus has drawn on a bag of evolutionary tricks to survive in one or another form in both humans and pigs with novel gene constellations through the periodic importation or exportation of viral genes. A prime example is emergence of pandemic novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) in 2009 that have transmitted to and spread among humans, resulting in outbreaks internationally. The phylogenetic analysis of sequences of all genes of the S-OIV, showed that its genome contained six gene segments that were similar to ones previously found in triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses circulating in pigs in North America. The genes encoding neuraminidase and M protein were most closely related to those in influenza A viruses circulating in swine populations in Eurasia. This unique genetic combination of influenza virus gene segments leading to the emergence of novel S-OIV that had not been seen before in the world. Here, it has been used evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. This paper shows that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine and makes a briefly review over the origins and evolutionary genomics of current S-OIV in humans with historical perspectives with a view to exhibition of evolutionary relationship between past and present origins of swine influenza viruses.

Title: An agent-based model to study the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of Influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses exhibit complex epidemiological patterns in a number of mammalian and avian hosts. Understanding transmission of these viruses necessitates taking into account their evolution, which represents a challenge for developing mathematical models. This is because the phrasing of multi-strain systems in terms of traditional compartmental ODE models either requires simplifying assumptions to be made that overlook important evolutionary processes, or leads to complex dynamical systems that are too cumbersome to analyse. Here, we develop an Individual-Based Model (IBM) in order to address simultaneously the ecology, epidemiology and evolution of strain-polymorphic pathogens, using Influenza A viruses as an illustrative example. We carry out careful validation of our IBM against comparable mathematical models to demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm and the sound basis for this novel framework. We discuss how this new approach can give critical insights in the study of influenza evolution.

Title: The proton translocation domain of cellular vacuolar ATPase provides a target for the treatment of influenza A virus infections.
Abstract: Cellular vacuolar ATPases (v-ATPase) play an important role in endosomal acidification, a critical step in influenza A virus (IAV) host cell infection. We investigated the antiviral activity of the v-ATPase inhibitor saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and compared it with several older v-ATPase inhibitors concanamycin A, bafilomycin A1, (BafA) and archazolid B targeting the subunit c of the V(0) sector. An in vitro assay was devised to quantify the anti-influenza effect of v-ATPase inhibitors by measuring green fluorescent protein fluorescence of a reporter IAV. These data were combined with cytotoxicity testing to calculate selectivity indices. Data were validated by testing v-ATPase inhibitors against wild-type IAV in vitro and in vivo in mice. In vitro SaliPhe blocked the proliferation of pandemic and multidrug resistant viruses at concentrations up to 51-fold below its cytotoxic concentrations. At essentially non-toxic concentrations, SaliPhe protected 62.5% of mice against a lethal challenge of a mouse-adapted influenza strain, while BafA at cytotoxic concentrations showed essentially no protection against infection with IAV (SaliPhe vs. BafA P < 0.001). Our results show that a distinct binding site of the proton translocation domain of cellular v-ATPase can be selectively targeted by a new generation v-ATPase inhibitor with reduced toxicity to treat influenza virus infections, including multi-resistant strains. Treatment strategies against influenza that target host cellular proteins are expected to be more resistant to virus mutations than drugs blocking viral proteins.

Title: DNA intercalator stimulates influenza transcription and virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus uses its host transcription machinery to facilitate viral RNA synthesis, an event that is associated with cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In this study, various RNAPII transcription inhibitors were used to investigate the effect of RNAPII phosphorylation status on viral RNA transcription. A low concentration of DNA intercalators, such as actinomycin D (ActD), was found to stimulate viral polymerase activity and virus replication. This effect was not observed in cells treated with RNAPII kinase inhibitors. In addition, the loss of RNAPII(a) in infected cells was due to the shift of nonphosphorylated RNAPII (RNAPII(a)) to hyperphosphorylated RNAPII (RNAPII(o)).

Title: A novel method of characterizing genetic sequences: genome space with biological distance and applications.
Abstract: Most existing methods for phylogenetic analysis involve developing an evolutionary model and then using some type of computational algorithm to perform multiple sequence alignment. There are two problems with this approach: (1) different evolutionary models can lead to different results, and (2) the computation time required for multiple alignments makes it impossible to analyse the phylogeny of a whole genome. This motivates us to create a new approach to characterize genetic sequences. To each DNA sequence, we associate a natural vector based on the distributions of nucleotides. This produces a one-to-one correspondence between the DNA sequence and its natural vector. We define the distance between two DNA sequences to be the distance between their associated natural vectors. This creates a genome space with a biological distance which makes global comparison of genomes with same topology possible. We use our proposed method to analyze the genomes of the new influenza A (H1N1) virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV) and mammalian mitochondrial. The result shows that a triple-reassortant swine virus circulating in North America and the Eurasian swine virus belong to the lineage of the influenza A (H1N1) virus. For the HRV and mammalian mitochondrial genomes, the results coincide with biologists' analyses. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for analyzing and annotating genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Whole or partial genomes can be handled more easily and more quickly than using multiple alignment methods. Once a genome space has been constructed, it can be stored in a database. There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for subsequent applications, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed to add new sequences. Furthermore, one can make a global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve.

Title: Toll-like receptor pre-stimulation protects mice against lethal infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses.
Abstract: Since the beginning of the 20th century, humans have experienced four influenza pandemics, including the devastating 1918 'Spanish influenza'. Moreover, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are currently spreading worldwide, although they are not yet efficiently transmitted among humans. While the threat of a global pandemic involving a highly pathogenic influenza virus strain looms large, our mechanisms to address such a catastrophe remain limited. Here, we show that pre-stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 increased resistance against influenza viruses known to induce high pathogenicity in animal models. Our data emphasize the complexity of the host response against different influenza viruses, and suggest that TLR agonists might be utilized to protect against lethality associated with highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host immune response modulation by Toll-like receptor stimulation and protection against influenza but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Effects of inhibitors of Toll-like receptors, protease-activated receptor-2 signalings and trypsin on influenza A virus replication and upregulation of cellular factors in cardiomyocytes.
Abstract: Severe influenza sometimes causes myocarditis. We recently found that influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces various cellular factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ectopic trypsin in mice hearts and in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The induction of these cellular factors in turn promotes viral replication, myocardial inflammation and cellular damage through their intracellular signal transductions in cooperation with the IAV-induced Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) signalings, although the precise nature of these interactions remain obscure. By using specific inhibitors of TLRs and PAR-2 signalings and trypsin inhibitor aprotinin, we analyzed the role of TLR signaling and PAR-2 signaling in the IAV-induced pathological changes in cardiomyocytes. Inhibitors of TLR7/8-Myeloid Differentiation factor 88-nuclear factor-κB signaling and aprotinin effectively suppressed IAV-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, MMPs, trypsinogen and viral replication. Inhibitor of TLR3-Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferons-dependent signaling predominantly suppressed the upregulation of interferon-β, a key intracellular host immune response factor. In contrast to the suppressive effect of trypsin inhibitor aprotinin on IAV replication, PAR-2 inhibitor FSY-NH(2), induced marginal upregulation of trypsinogen and subsequent stimulation of IAV replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper investigates the role of host cellular signaling pathways and inhibitors on influenza replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A review of mathematical models of influenza A infections within a host or cell culture: lessons learned and challenges ahead.
Abstract: Most mathematical models used to study the dynamics of influenza A have thus far focused on the between-host population level, with the aim to inform public health decisions regarding issues such as drug and social distancing intervention strategies, antiviral stockpiling or vaccine distribution. Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture. Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of mathematical models of influenza infection dynamics and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The influenza virus RNA synthesis machine: advances in its structure and function.
Abstract: The influenza A viruses are the causative agents of respiratory disease that occurs as yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. These viruses are endemic in wild avian species and can sometimes break the species barrier to infect and generate new virus lineages in humans. The influenza A virus genome consists of eight single-stranded, negative-polarity RNAs that form ribonucleoprotein complexes by association to the RNA polymerase and the nucleoprotein. In this review we focus on the structure of this RNA-synthesis machines and the included RNA polymerase, and on the mechanisms by which they express their genetic information as mRNAs and generate progeny ribonucleoproteins that will become incorporated into new infectious virions. New structural, biochemical and genetic data are rapidly accumulating in this very active area of research. We discuss these results and attempt to integrate the information into structural and functional models that may help the design of new experiments and further our knowledge on virus RNA replication and gene expression. This interplay between structural and functional data will eventually provide new targets for controlled attenuation or antiviral therapy.

Reason: This is a review focusing on the structure and function of the influenza virus RNA synthesis machinery without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay for influenza surveillance.
Abstract: For surveillance purposes real-time PCR assays for influenza viruses had to be adapted to the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 strain. We combined published primers and probes for influenza A, influenza B and an internal amplification control with a detection system for influenza A(H1N1)2009 to set up a rapid, reliable, simple and cost-effective high-throughput multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR. The workflow also includes automated sample preparation for high-throughput screening. The lower limit of detection of the multiplex assay was 3.5x10(2) RNA copies per PCR reaction. The diagnostic sensitivity of the multiplex assay was 87.7%, but increased to 99.4% for influenza-positive samples yielding C(t) values of less than 34 cycles in the respective diagnostic assay. High specificity was confirmed by sequencing and correct detection of 15 reference samples from two quality assurance studies. The multiplex PCR was introduced for surveillance of samples from a network of general practitioners and paediatricians in Bavaria, Germany during the influenza pandemic of 2009. Comparison with surveillance data from reported cases proved the reliability of the multiplex assay for influenza surveillance programmes.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes development of a multiplex RT-PCR assay for influenza surveillance without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A generic system for the expression and purification of soluble and stable influenza neuraminidase.
Abstract: The influenza surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) is essential for the efficient spread of the virus. Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) that inhibit NA enzyme activity have been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza infections. The recent 'swine flu' pandemic and world-wide emergence of Tamiflu-resistant seasonal human influenza A(H1N1) H(274)Y have highlighted the need for the ongoing development of new anti-virals, efficient production of vaccine proteins and novel diagnostic tools. Each of these goals could benefit from the production of large quantities of highly pure and stable NA. This publication describes a generic expression system for NAs in a baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) that is capable of expressing milligram amounts of recombinant NA. To construct NAs with increased stability, the natural influenza NA stalk was replaced by two different artificial tetramerization domains that drive the formation of catalytically active NA homotetramers: GCN4-pLI from yeast or the Tetrabrachion tetramerization domain from Staphylothermus marinus. Both recombinant NAs are secreted as FLAG-tagged proteins to allow for rapid and simple purification. The Tetrabrachion-based NA showed good solubility, increased stability and biochemical properties closer to the original viral NA than the GCN4-pLI based construct. The expressed quantities and high quality of the purified recombinant NA suggest that this expression system is capable of producing recombinant NA for a broad range of applications including high-throughput drug screening, protein crystallisation, or vaccine development.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes a system for expression and purification of neuraminidase protein, focusing on protein production rather than linking viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: Influenza and other respiratory viruses in three Central American countries.
Abstract: Despite the disease burden imposed by respiratory diseases on children in Central America, there is a paucity of data describing the etiologic agents of the disease. To analyze viral etiologic agents associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in participants reporting to one outpatient health center, one pediatric hospital, and three general hospitals in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua Material & Between August 2006 and April 2009, pharyngeal swabs were collected from outpatients and inpatients. Patient specimens were inoculated onto cultured cell monolayers, and viral antigens were detected by indirect and direct immunofluorescence staining. A total of 1,756 patients were enrolled, of whom 1,195 (68.3%) were under the age of 5; and 183 (10.4%) required hospitalization. One or more viral agents were identified in 434 (24.7%) cases, of which 17 (3.9%) were dual infections. The most common viruses isolated were influenza A virus (130; 7.4% of cases), respiratory syncytial virus (122; 6.9%), adenoviruses (63; 3.6%), parainfluenza viruses (57; 3.2%), influenza B virus (47; 2.7% of cases), and herpes simplex virus 1 (22; 1.3%). In addition, human metapneumovirus and enteroviruses (coxsackie and echovirus) were isolated from patient specimens. When compared to the rest of the population, viruses were isolated from a significantly higher percentage of patients age 5 or younger. The prevalence of influenza A virus or influenza B virus infections was similar between the younger and older age groups. RSV was the most commonly detected pathogen in infants age 5 and younger and was significantly associated with pneumonia (p < 0.0001) and hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Genetic analysis of influenza isolates identified A (H3N2), A (H1N1), and B viruses. It also showed that the mutation H274Y conferring resistance to oseltamivir was first detected in Honduran influenza A/H1N1 strains at the beginning of 2008. These data demonstrate that a diverse range of respiratory pathogens are associated with ILI in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. RSV infection in particular appears to be associated with severe disease in infants in the region.

Title: Reverse genetics plasmid for cloning unstable influenza A virus gene segments.
Abstract: Reverse genetics approaches that enable the generation of recombinant influenza A viruses entirely from plasmids are invaluable for studies on virus replication, morphogenesis, pathogenesis, or transmission. Furthermore, influenza virus reverse genetics is now critical for the development of new vaccines for this human and animal pathogen. Periodically, influenza gene segments are unstable within plasmids in bacteria. The PB2 gene segment of a highly pathogenic avian H5 influenza virus A/Turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (Ty/Ont) was unstable in commonly available cloning plasmids (e.g., pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO) and in standard influenza virus reverse genetics plasmids (e.g., pHH21), which contain high copy origins of replication. Thus, a low-copy influenza reverse genetics plasmid (pGJ3C3) was developed to enable rapid cloning of unstable influenza A virus genes using ligation-independent recombination-based cloning. The unstable Ty/Ont PB2 gene segment was efficiently cloned using the pGJ3C3 plasmid and this clone was used to rescue a recombinant Ty/Ont virus. This low copy reverse genetics plasmid will be useful for cloning other unstable segments of influenza A viruses in order to rescue recombinant viruses, which will facilitate basic studies and vaccine seed stock production.

Title: Evaluation of the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) as a screening method for the detection of influenza viruses in the fecal materials of water birds.
Abstract: Migratory water birds are a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. Viruses replicate in the intestines of ducks and are shed with the fecal materials. Virus isolation from collected fecal materials, therefore, is an integral part of the surveillance of avian influenza in water birds. In the present study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was assessed for its usefulness in detecting the RNA of influenza A viruses in fecal materials. It was found that, RT-LAMP specifically and sensitively detects the matrix gene of influenza A viruses. Influenza A viruses were isolated from the fecal materials in which viral RNA were detected by RT-LAMP in 35 min. The present findings indicate that RT-LAMP is useful as a high throughput screening method for field samples prior to virus isolation, allowing the processing of hundreds of samples per day.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates a detection method for influenza virus RNA in fecal samples but does not link viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1): pathways of exposure at the animal-human interface, a systematic review.
Abstract: The threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses to humans remains significant, given the continued occurrence of sporadic human cases (499 human cases in 15 countries) with a high case fatality rate (approximately 60%), the endemicity in poultry populations in several countries, and the potential for reassortment with the newly emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. Therefore, we review risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans. Several epidemiologic studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with increased risk of H5N1 infection among humans who were exposed to H5N1 viruses. Our review shows that most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry. Most cases are sporadic, while occasional limited human-to-human transmission occurs. The most commonly identified factors associated with H5N1 virus infection included exposure through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids of infected poultry via food preparation practices; touching and caring for infected poultry; [corrected] exposure to H5N1 via swimming or bathing in potentially virus laden ponds; and exposure to H5N1 at live bird markets. Research has demonstrated that despite frequent and widespread contact with poultry, transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans is rare. Available research has identified several risk factors that may be associated with infection including close direct contact with poultry and transmission via the environment. However, several important data gaps remain that limit our understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans. Although infection in humans with H5N1 remains rare, human cases continue to be reported and H5N1 is now considered endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and in Egypt, providing opportunities for additional human infections and for the acquisition of virus mutations that may lead to more efficient spread among humans and other mammalian species. Collaboration between human and animal health sectors for surveillance, case investigation, virus sharing, and risk assessment is essential to monitor for potential changes in circulating H5N1 viruses and in the epidemiology of H5N1 in order to provide the best possible chance for effective mitigation of the impact of H5N1 in both poultry and humans. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the institutions or organizations with which they are affiliated.

Title: Zanamivir, at 600 milligrams twice daily, inhibits oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model system.
Abstract: In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus emerged and spread worldwide, initiating a pandemic. Various isolates obtained from disparate parts of the world were shown to be uniformly resistant to the adamantanes but sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Over time, resistance to oseltamivir became more prevalent among pandemic H1N1 virus isolates, while most remained susceptible to zanamivir. The government has proposed the use of intravenous (i.v.) zanamivir to treat serious influenza virus infections among hospitalized patients. To use zanamivir effectively for patients with severe influenza, it is necessary to know the optimal dose and schedule of administration of zanamivir that will inhibit the replication of oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant influenza viruses. Therefore, we performed studies using the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model system to predict optimal dosing regimens for zanamivir against an oseltamivir-sensitive and an oseltamivir-resistant virus. Our results demonstrated that zanamivir, at a dose of 600 mg given twice a day (Q12h), inhibited the replication of oseltamivir-sensitive and oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses throughout the course of the experiment. Thus, our findings suggest that intravenous zanamivir, at a dose of 600 mg Q12h, could be used to treat hospitalized patients suffering from serious infections with oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral drug dosing and efficacy against oseltamivir-sensitive and resistant viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Direct imaging of pH1N1 2009 influenza virus replication in alveolar pneumocytes in fatal cases by transmission electron microscopy.
Abstract: Human influenza virus pandemics constitute a major global public health issue. Although studies on autopsy specimens from the recent pandemic by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus have revealed a broad spectrum of pathologic findings, direct electron microscopic studies of the lung tissue from influenza fatalities are few. In this study, we examined five well-preserved pulmonary necropsy specimens from fatal cases of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 from India. The novel observations in comparison with earlier reports included direct imaging of influenza virus budding within dilated cisternae of pneumocytes, cell-free virus emerging from the cell membrane of a pneumocyte in the alveolar lumen, presence of polymorphonuclear cells with red blood cells as inflammatory exudates close to hyaline membranes and extensive cytoplasmic degeneration of epithelial cells of the alveolar lining. These observations are in consistent with the earlier findings and emphasize the possible role of this virus directly infecting cells of the lower respiratory tract as a key event in the rapid pathogenesis of pH1N1 disease process.

Title: Distinct patterns of IFITM-mediated restriction of filoviruses, SARS coronavirus, and influenza A virus.
Abstract: Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2, and 3 (IFITM1, 2, and 3) are recently identified viral restriction factors that inhibit infection mediated by the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Here we show that IFITM proteins restricted infection mediated by the entry glycoproteins (GP(1,2)) of Marburg and Ebola filoviruses (MARV, EBOV). Consistent with these observations, interferon-β specifically restricted filovirus and IAV entry processes. IFITM proteins also inhibited replication of infectious MARV and EBOV. We observed distinct patterns of IFITM-mediated restriction: compared with IAV, the entry processes of MARV and EBOV were less restricted by IFITM3, but more restricted by IFITM1. Moreover, murine Ifitm5 and 6 did not restrict IAV, but efficiently inhibited filovirus entry. We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins. The profile of IFITM-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV was more similar to that of filoviruses than to IAV. Trypsin treatment of receptor-associated SARS-CoV pseudovirions, which bypasses their dependence on lysosomal cathepsin L, also bypassed IFITM-mediated restriction. However, IFITM proteins did not reduce cellular cathepsin activity or limit access of virions to acidic intracellular compartments. Our data indicate that IFITM-mediated restriction is localized to a late stage in the endocytic pathway. They further show that IFITM proteins differentially restrict the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses, and modulate cellular tropism independently of viral receptor expression.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies IFITM protein-mediated restriction of various viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus assembly and budding.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemics and is a significant global health burden. Influenza virus is an enveloped virus that contains a segmented negative strand RNA genome. Assembly and budding of progeny influenza virions is a complex, multi-step process that occurs in lipid raft domains on the apical membrane of infected cells. The viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are targeted to lipid rafts, causing the coalescence and enlargement of the raft domains. This clustering of HA and NA may cause a deformation of the membrane and the initiation of the virus budding event. M1 is then thought to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA where it can then polymerize and form the interior structure of the emerging virion. M1, bound to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA, additionally serves as a docking site for the recruitment of the viral RNPs and may mediate the recruitment of M2 to the site of virus budding. M2 initially stabilizes the site of budding, possibly enabling the polymerization of the matrix protein and the formation of filamentous virions. Subsequently, M2 is able to alter membrane curvature at the neck of the budding virus, causing membrane scission and the release of the progeny virion. This review investigates the latest research on influenza virus budding in an attempt to provide a step-by-step analysis of the assembly and budding processes for influenza viruses.

Title: Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors block multiple steps of influenza a virus replication.
Abstract: Host signaling pathways play important roles in the replication of influenza virus, but their functional effects remain to be characterized at the molecular level. Here we identify two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) of the tyrphostin class that exhibit robust antiviral activity against influenza A virus replication in cultured cells. One of these (AG879) is a selective inhibitor of the nerve growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (TrkA/HER2) signaling; the other, tyrphostin A9 (A9), inhibits the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathway. We find that each inhibits at least three postentry steps of the influenza virus life cycle: AG879 and A9 both strongly inhibit the synthesis of all three influenza virus RNA species, block Crm1-dependent nuclear export, and also prevent the release of viral particles through a pathway that is modulated by the lipid biosynthesis enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS). Tests of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown and additional small-molecule inhibitors confirmed that interventions targeting TrkA can suppress influenza virus replication. Our study suggests that host cell receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is required for maximal influenza virus RNA synthesis, viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) nuclear export, and virus release and that specific RTKIs hold promise as novel anti-influenza virus therapeutics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host cell signaling pathways and inhibitors affecting influenza virus replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The emergence of pandemic influenza viruses.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza has posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide in the last decade. In the 20th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, the evolutionary history of the pandemic viruses has been controversial, largely due to the lack of background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides a unique opportunity to investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into the emergence of this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes the evolutionary pathway of the pandemic viruses. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the early detection and control of future pandemics.

Title: Surveillance of equine respiratory viruses in Ontario.
Abstract: The objective of this project was to develop and implement an active surveillance program for the early and rapid detection of equine influenza viruses in Ontario. For this purpose, from October 2003 to October 2005, nasopharyngeal swabs and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected from 115 client-owned horses in 23 outbreaks of respiratory disease in Ontario. Sera were paired and tested for antibody to equine influenza 1 (AE1-H7N7), equine influenza 2 (AE2-H3N8), equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV1 and EHV4), and equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV). Overall, the cause-specific morbidity rate of equine influenza virus in the respiratory outbreaks was 56.5% as determined by the single radial hemolysis (SRH) test. The AE2-H3N8 was isolated from 15 horses in 5 outbreaks. A 4-fold increase in antibody levels or the presence of a high titer against ERAV or ERBV was observed in 10 out of 13 outbreaks in which AE2-H3N8 was diagnosed as the primary cause of disease. In conclusion, AE2-H3N8 was found to be an important contributor to equine respiratory viral disease. Equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV) represented an important component in the equine respiratory disease of performing horses.

Title: Assortment and packaging of the segmented rotavirus genome.
Abstract: The rotavirus (RV) genome comprises 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and is contained within a non-enveloped, icosahedral particle. During assembly, a highly coordinated selective packaging mechanism ensures that progeny RV virions contain one of each genome segment. Cis-acting signals thought to mediate assortment and packaging are associated with putative panhandle structures formed by base-pairing of the ends of RV plus-strand RNAs (+RNAs). Viral polymerases within assembling core particles convert the 11 distinct +RNAs to dsRNA genome segments. It remains unclear whether RV +RNAs are assorted before or during encapsidation, and the functions of viral proteins during these processes are not resolved. However, as reviewed here, recent insights gained from the study of RV and two other segmented RNA viruses, influenza A virus and bacteriophage Φ6, reveal potential mechanisms of RV assortment and packaging.

Title: Mongrelised genetics of H1N1 virus: a bird's eyeview.
Abstract: H1N1 influenza, also known as "novel H1N1 virus" has led to a "global outcry." This virus is more virulent when compared with other seasonal flu viruses. Virulence may change as the adaptive mutation gene increases within the virus. A study at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain as they showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction when compared with adults aged 18-64 years, who showed a cross-reactive antibody reaction of 6-9% and older adults with 33% immunity. This review article depicts H1N1 virus, its virulence with genetic evolution potential and preventive protocol for the dental professionals. This would allow us to comprehend the changes in the disease process and contribute in its prevention as "prevention is better than cure."

Title: Iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The 2009 flu pandemic and the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza strains highlight the need for treatment alternatives. One such option is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity. In vitro tests demonstrated that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of influenza A virus infection, most importantly also of pandemic H1N1/2009 in vitro. Consequently, we tested a commercially available nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in an influenza A mouse infection model. Treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A PR8/34 H1N1 virus with iota-carrageenan starting up to 48 hours post infection resulted in a strong protection of mice similar to mice treated with oseltamivir. Since alternative treatment options for influenza are rare, we conclude that the nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan is an alternative to neuraminidase inhibitors and should be tested for prevention and treatment of influenza A in clinical trials in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates the antiviral effect of iota-carrageenan but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Influenza viruses characterized thus far in the influenza season are well matched to the strains included in the 2010-11 influenza vaccine. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity during this period.
Relevant: False

Title: Emergency surveillance of influenza during 2009 in the Chinese city of Qingdao.
Abstract: In April, 2009, a new influenza pandemic caused by a swine-origin H1N1 subtype influenza virus was imminent. We thereby carried out an emergency surveillance study in a Chinese city of Qingdao. Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from four targeted groups and tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Each laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 case or cluster was investigated, and the hemagglutinin genes of some of the viruses were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 140 pandemic H1N1 cases including 92 from 7 clusters were identified in the four targeted groups. None of them developed into severe infections. Meanwhile, 103 cases of seasonal influenza (98 H3N2 and 5 H1N1) and 10 clusters of seasonal H3N2 influenza were also identified. Among them, 38 pandemic H1N1 and two seasonal H3N2 influenza cases were air travellers, suggesting that air travel facilitates the spread of pandemic and seasonal influenza even in the northern hemisphere summer. In addition, it was found that pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses co-circulated in two clusters. No significant mutations were found in the hemagglutinin gene sequences of pandemic H1N1 viruses, but the seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses have become genetically distinguishable from those circulating in 2007-2008.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on surveillance and genetic sequencing of influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Network analysis of global influenza spread.
Abstract: Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection, strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes global influenza spread using sequence data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance and analysis of avian influenza viruses, Australia.
Abstract: We investigated carriage of avian influenza viruses by wild birds in Australia, 2005-2008, to assess the risks to poultry industries and human health. We collected 21,858 (7,357 cloacal, 14,501 fecal) samples and detected 300 viruses, representing a detection rate of ≈1.4%. Rates were highest in autumn (March-May) and differed substantially between bird types, areas, and years. We typed 107 avian influenza viruses and identified 19 H5, 8 H7, and 16 H9 (40% of typed viruses). All were of low pathogenicity. These viruses formed clearly different phylogenetic clades to lineages from Eurasia or North America, suggesting the potential existence of Australian lineages. H7 viruses were similar to highly pathogenic H7 strains that caused outbreaks in poultry in Australia. Several periods of increased detection rates (numbers or subtypes of viruses) were identified. This study demonstrates the need for ongoing surveillance to detect emerging pathogenic strains and facilitate prevention of outbreaks.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports surveillance and phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Recent demand for increased understanding of avian influenza virus in its natural hosts, together with the development of high-throughput diagnostics, has heralded a new era in wildlife disease surveillance. However, survey design, sampling, and interpretation in the context of host populations still present major challenges. We critically reviewed current surveillance to distill a series of considerations pertinent to avian influenza virus surveillance in wild birds, including consideration of what, when, where, and how many to sample in the context of survey objectives. Recognizing that wildlife disease surveillance is logistically and financially constrained, we discuss pragmatic alternatives for achieving probability-based sampling schemes that capture this host-pathogen system. We recommend hypothesis-driven surveillance through standardized, local surveys that are, in turn, strategically compiled over broad geographic areas. Rethinking the use of existing surveillance infrastructure can thereby greatly enhance our global understanding of avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews surveillance strategies for avian influenza virus in wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The pathogenesis of low pathogenicity H7 avian influenza viruses in chickens, ducks and turkeys.
Abstract: Avian influenza (AI) viruses infect numerous avian species, and low pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses of the H7 subtype are typically reported to produce mild or subclinical infections in both wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry. However relatively little work has been done to compare LPAI viruses from different avian species for their ability to cause disease in domestic poultry under the same conditions. In this study twelve H7 LPAI virus isolates from North America were each evaluated for their comparative pathogenesis in chickens, ducks, and turkeys. All 12 isolates were able to infect all three species at a dose of 106 50% egg infectious doses based on seroconversion, although not all animals seroconverted with each isolate-species combination. The severity of disease varied among isolate and species combinations, but there was a consistent trend for clinical disease to be most severe in turkeys where all 12 isolates induced disease, and mortality was observed in turkeys exposed to 9 of the 12 viruses. Turkeys also shed virus by the oral and cloacal routes at significantly higher titers than either ducks or chickens at numerous time points. Only 3 isolates induced observable clinical disease in ducks and only 6 isolates induced disease in chickens, which was generally very mild and did not result in mortality. Full genome sequence was completed for all 12 isolates and some isolates did have features consistent with adaptation to poultry (e.g. NA stalk deletions), however none of these features correlated with disease severity. The data suggests that turkeys may be more susceptible to clinical disease from the H7 LPAI viruses included in this study than either chickens or ducks. However the severity of disease and degree of virus shed was not clearly correlated with any isolate or group of isolates, but relied on specific species and isolate combinations.
Relevant: False
Reason: Although the study sequences viral genomes and assesses pathogenicity in different species, it finds no clear correlation between genetic features and disease severity, thus no explicit genotype-phenotype link.

Title: The anti-tumor agent, 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), induces IFN-beta-mediated antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: The 2009 outbreak of pandemic H1N1 influenza, increased drug resistance, and the significant delay in obtaining adequate numbers of vaccine doses have heightened awareness of the need to develop new antiviral drugs that can be used prophylactically or therapeutically. Previously, we showed that the experimental anti-tumor drug DMXAA potently induced IFN-β but relatively low TNF-α expression in vitro. This study confirms these findings in vivo and demonstrates further that DMXAA induces potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DMXAA protected RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells from VSV-induced cytotoxicity and moreover, inhibited replication of influenza, including the Tamiflu®-resistant H1N1 influenza A/Br strain, in MDCK cells. In vivo, DMXAA protected WT C57BL/6J but not IFN-β(-/-) mice from lethality induced by the mouse-adapted H1N1 PR8 influenza strain when administered before or after infection. Protection was accompanied by mitigation of weight loss, increased IFN-β mRNA and protein levels in the lung, and significant inhibition of viral replication in vivo early after DMXAA treatment. Collectively, this study provides data to support the use of DMXAA as a novel antiviral agent.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral activity of a drug inducing IFN-beta and does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Identification of oseltamivir resistance among pandemic and seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses by an His275Tyr genotyping assay using the cycling probe method.
Abstract: Neuraminidase inhibitors are agents used against influenza viruses; however, the emergence of drug-resistant strains is a major concern. Recently, the prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus increased globally and the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses was reported. In this study, we developed a cycling probe real-time PCR method for the detection of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A (H1N1) and pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses. We designed two sets of primers and probes that were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein or 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correspond to a histidine and a tyrosine at position 275 in the neuraminidase protein, respectively. These SNPs confer susceptibility and resistance to oseltamivir, respectively. In the 2007-2008 season, the prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses was 0% (0/72), but in the 2008-2009 season, it increased to 100% (282/282). In the 2009-2010 season, all of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses were susceptible to oseltamivir (0/73, 0%). This method is sensitive and specific for the screening of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses. This method is applicable to routine laboratory-based monitoring of drug resistance and patient management during antiviral therapy.

Title: Interspecific exchange of avian influenza virus genes in Alaska: the influence of trans-hemispheric migratory tendency and breeding ground sympatry.
Abstract: The movement and transmission of avian influenza viral strains via wild migratory birds may vary by host species as a result of migratory tendency and sympatry with other infected individuals. To examine the roles of host migratory tendency and species sympatry on the movement of Eurasian low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) genes into North America, we characterized migratory patterns and LPAI viral genomic variation in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of Alaska in comparison with LPAI diversity of northern pintails (Anas acuta). A 50-year band-recovery data set suggests that unlike northern pintails, mallards rarely make trans-hemispheric migrations between Alaska and Eurasia. Concordantly, fewer (14.5%) of 62 LPAI isolates from mallards contained Eurasian gene segments compared to those from 97 northern pintails (35%), a species with greater inter-continental migratory tendency. Aerial survey and banding data suggest that mallards and northern pintails are largely sympatric throughout Alaska during the breeding season, promoting opportunities for interspecific transmission. Comparisons of full-genome isolates confirmed near-complete genetic homology (>99.5%) of seven viruses between mallards and northern pintails. This study found viral segments of Eurasian lineage at a higher frequency in mallards than previous studies, suggesting transmission from other avian species migrating inter-hemispherically or the common occurrence of endemic Alaskan viruses containing segments of Eurasian origin. We conclude that mallards are unlikely to transfer Asian-origin viruses directly to North America via Alaska but that they are likely infected with Asian-origin viruses via interspecific transfer from species with regular migrations to the Eastern Hemisphere.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on ecological and migratory influences on viral gene flow and reassortment but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: In vitro inhibitory activity of Alpinia katsumadai extracts against influenza virus infection and hemagglutination.
Abstract: Alpinia katsumadai (AK) extracts and fractions were tested for in vitro antiviral activities against influenza virus type A, specially human A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and avian A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2), by means of time-of-addition experiments; pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post treatment. In pre-treatment assay, the AK extracts and AK fractions did not show significant antiviral activity. During the simultaneous treatment assay, one AK extract and five AK fractions designated as AK-1 to AK-3, AK-5, AK-10, and AK-11 showed complete inhibition of virus infectivity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2). The 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC₅₀) of these one AK extracts and five AK fractions with exception of the AK-9 were from 0.8 ± 1.4 to 16.4 ± 4.5 μg/mL against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The two AK extracts and three AK fractions had EC₅₀ values ranging from <0.39 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ± 3.6 μg/mL against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2). By the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the two AK extracts and five AK fractions completely inhibited viral adsorption onto chicken RBCs at less than 100 μg/mL against both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2). Interestingly, only AK-3 was found with inhibition for both viral attachment and viral replication after showing extended antiviral activity during the post treatment assay and quantitative real-time PCR. These results suggest that AK extracts and fractions had strong anti-influenza virus activity that can inhibit viral attachment and/or viral replication, and may be used as viral prophylaxis.

Title: Discovery of novel benzoquinazolinones and thiazoloimidazoles, inhibitors of influenza H5N1 and H1N1 viruses, from a cell-based high-throughput screen.
Abstract: A highly reproducible and robust cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was adapted for screening of small molecules for antiviral activity against influenza virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). The NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) Molecular Libraries Screening Centers Network (MLSCN) 100,000-compound library was screened at 50 µM. The "hit" rate (>25% inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect) from the single-dose screen was 0.32%. The hits were evaluated for their antiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity in dose-response experiments. The screen yielded 5 active compounds (SI value >3). One compound showed an SI(50) value of greater than 3, 3 compounds had SI values ranging from greater than 14 to 34, and the most active compound displayed an SI value of 94. The active compounds represent 2 different classes of molecules, benzoquinazolinones and thiazoloimidazoles, which have not been previously identified as having antiviral/anti-influenza activity. These molecules were also effective against influenza A/California/04/2009 virus (H1N1) and other H1N1 and H5N1 virus strains in vitro but not H3N2 strains. Real-time qRT-PCR results reveal that these chemotypes significantly reduced M1 RNA levels as compared to the no-drug influenza-infected Madin Darby canine kidney cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on screening small molecules for antiviral activity against influenza viruses; it does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Base-pairing promotes leader selection to prime in vitro influenza genome transcription.
Abstract: The requirements for alignment of capped leader sequences along the viral genome during influenza transcription initiation (cap-snatching) have long been an enigma. In this study, competition experiments using an in vitro transcription assay revealed that influenza virus transcriptase prefers leader sequences with base complementarity to the 3'-ultimate residues of the viral template, 10 or 11 nt from the 5' cap. Internal priming at the 3'-penultimate residue, as well as prime-and-realign was observed. The nucleotide identity immediately 5' of the base-pairing residues also affected cap donor usage. Application to the in vitro system of RNA molecules with increased base complementarity to the viral RNA template showed stronger reduction of globin RNA leader initiated influenza transcription compared to those with a single base-pairing possibility. Altogether the results indicated an optimal cap donor consensus sequence of (7m)G-(N)(7-8)-(A/U/G)-(A/U)-AGC-3'.

Title: Exosome-driven antigen transfer for MHC class II presentation facilitated by the receptor binding activity of influenza hemagglutinin.
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation, the transfer of Ag from an infected cell to a professional APC, have been studied in great detail. Much less is known about the equivalent process for MHC class II-restricted presentation. After infection or transfection of class II-negative donor cells, we observed minimal transfer of a proteasome-dependent "class I-like" epitope within the influenza neuraminidase glycoprotein but potent transfer of a classical, H-2M-dependent epitope within the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Additional experiments determined transfer to be exosome-mediated and substantially enhanced by the receptor binding activity of incorporated HA. Furthermore, a carrier effect was observed in that incorporated HA improved exosome-mediated transfer of a second membrane protein. This route of Ag presentation should be relevant to other enveloped viruses, may skew CD4(+) responses toward exosome-incorporated glycoproteins, and points toward novel vaccine strategies.

Title: Low-dimensional clustering detects incipient dominant influenza strain clusters.
Abstract: Influenza has been circulating in the human population and has caused three pandemics in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2). The 2009 A(H1N1) was classified by World Health Organization as the fourth pandemic. Influenza has a high evolution rate, which makes vaccine design challenging. We here consider an approach for early detection of new dominant strains. By clustering the 2009 A(H1N1) sequence data, we found two main clusters. We then define a metric to detect the emergence of dominant strains. We show on historical H3N2 data that this method is able to identify a cluster around an incipient dominant strain before it becomes dominant. For example, for H3N2 as of 30 March 2009, the method detects the cluster for the new A/British Columbia/RV1222/2009 strain. This strain detection tool would appear to be useful for annual influenza vaccine selection.

Title: Investigation of the influence of EPs® 7630, a herbal drug preparation from Pelargonium sidoides, on replication of a broad panel of respiratory viruses.
Abstract: The Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs® 7630 is an approved drug for the treatment of acute bronchitis in Germany. The postulated mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of EPs® 7630 in bronchitis patients include immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects, inhibition of interaction between bacteria and host cells, and increase of cilliary beat frequency on respiratory cells. Here, we investigated the influence of EPs® 7630 on replication of a panel of respiratory viruses. Determination of virus-induced cytopathogenic effects and virus titres revealed that EPs® 7630 at concentrations up to 100 μg/ml interfered with replication of seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2), respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus but did not affect replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), adenovirus, or rhinovirus. Therefore, antiviral effects may contribute to the beneficial effects exerted by EPs® 7630 in acute bronchitis patients.

Title: One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009, seasonal influenza A/H1N1, and seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. A previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting A/H1N1pdm virus (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to viral mutation. To help with the screening of the A/H1N1pdm virus, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting human seasonal A/H1N1 (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and A/H3N2 influenza viruses (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two viral strains of A/H1N1pdm, namely, A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm and A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for A/H1pdm, A/H3, and A/H1, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for influenza A viruses. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing influenza viruses, but also for the surveillance of influenza viruses.

Title: Genetic diversity of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses in Finland.
Abstract: In Finland, the first infections caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus were identified on May 10. During the next three months almost all infections were found from patients who had recently traveled abroad. In September 2009 the pandemic virus started to spread in the general population, leading to localized outbreaks and peak epidemic activity was reached during weeks 43-48. The nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from viruses collected from 138 patients were determined. The analyzed viruses represented mild and severe infections and different geographic regions and time periods. Based on HA and NA gene sequences, the Finnish pandemic viruses clustered in four groups. Finnish epidemic viruses and A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus strain varied from 2-8 and 0-5 amino acids in HA and NA molecules, respectively, giving a respective maximal evolution speed of 1.4% and 1.1%. Most amino acid changes in HA and NA molecules accumulated on the surface of the molecule and were partly located in antigenic sites. Three severe infections were detected with a mutation at HA residue 222, in two viruses with a change D222G, and in one virus D222Y. Also viruses with change D222E were identified. All Finnish pandemic viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir having the amino acid histidine at residue 275 of the neuraminidase molecule. The Finnish pandemic viruses were quite closely related to A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus. Neither in the HA nor in the NA were changes identified that may lead to the selection of a virus with increased epidemic potential or exceptionally high virulence. Continued laboratory-based surveillance of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is important in order to rapidly identify drug resistant viruses and/or virus variants with potential ability to cause severe forms of infection and an ability to circumvent vaccine-induced immunity.

Title: High-throughput identification of compounds targeting influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity.
Abstract: As influenza viruses have developed resistance towards current drugs, new inhibitors that prevent viral replication through different inhibitory mechanisms are useful. In this study, we developed a screening procedure to search for new antiinfluenza inhibitors from 1,200,000 compounds and identified previously reported as well as new antiinfluenza compounds. Several antiinfluenza compounds were inhibitory to the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), including nucleozin and its analogs. The most potent nucleozin analog, 3061 (FA-2), inhibited the replication of the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus in MDCK cells at submicromolar concentrations and protected the lethal H1N1 infection of mice. Influenza variants resistant to 3061 (FA-2) were isolated and shown to have the mutation on nucleoprotein (NP) that is distinct from the recently reported resistant mutation of Y289H [Kao R, et al. (2010) Nat Biotechnol 28:600]. Recombinant influenza carrying the Y52H NP is also resistant to 3061 (FA-2), and NP aggregation induced by 3061 (FA-2) was identified as the most likely cause for inhibition. In addition, we identified another antiinfluenza RdRP inhibitor 367 which targets PB1 protein but not NP. A mutant resistant to 367 has H456P mutation at the PB1 protein and both the recombinant influenza and the RdRP expressing the PB1 H456P mutation have elevated resistance to 367. Our high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign thus resulted in the identification of antiinfluenza compounds targeting RdRP activity.

Title: An open-label, randomized clinical trial assessing immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered sequentially or simultaneously with seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine to paediatric kidney transplant recipients.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of the 2009 A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, administered sequentially or simultaneously with the seasonal 2009-10 virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, to paediatric kidney transplant recipients. Thirty-two children and adolescents with transplanted kidneys and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were randomized 1:1 to receive the pandemic vaccine upon enrolment and the seasonal vaccine 1 month later (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls), or to receive the two vaccines simultaneously upon enrolment (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls). When the pandemic vaccine was administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine, it was significantly less immunogenic in the patients than in the controls (P < 0.05); when it was administered together with the seasonal vaccine, the immune response of both patients (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.05) was significantly greater than when it was administered sequentially. Seroconversion rates and the geometric mean titres of all of the seasonal antigens were significantly lower in the patients, regardless of the type of vaccine administration (P < 0.05). Simultaneous administration was associated with a better immune response against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens in both patients and controls, and did not increase the mild local and systemic reactions. No impact on renal function was observed. Paediatric kidney transplant recipients have a lower immune response to the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted and seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccines than healthy controls. The simultaneous administration of the two vaccines seems to increase immune response to both pandemic and seasonal A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens, and has the same safety profile as that of the pandemic vaccine administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine.
Relevant: False
Reason: This clinical trial assesses vaccine immunogenicity and safety in pediatric kidney transplant recipients but does not explore viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Allele dynamics plots for the study of evolutionary dynamics in viral populations.
Abstract: Phylodynamic techniques combine epidemiological and genetic information to analyze the evolutionary and spatiotemporal dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza A or human immunodeficiency viruses. We introduce 'allele dynamics plots' (AD plots) as a method for visualizing the evolutionary dynamics of a gene in a population. Using AD plots, we propose how to identify the alleles that are likely to be subject to directional selection. We analyze the method's merits with a detailed study of the evolutionary dynamics of seasonal influenza A viruses. AD plots for the major surface protein of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and the 2009 swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) viruses show the succession of substitutions that became fixed in the evolution of the two viral populations. They also allow the early identification of those viral strains that later rise to predominance, which is important for the problem of vaccine strain selection. In summary, we describe a technique that reveals the evolutionary dynamics of a rapidly evolving population and allows us to identify alleles and associated genetic changes that might be under directional selection. The method can be applied for the study of influenza A viruses and other rapidly evolving species or viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper presents a method for visualizing evolutionary dynamics and identifying alleles under selection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A matrix gene-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of 2009 pandemic H1N1 and other influenza A viruses in North America.
Abstract: The emergence in humans of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) with similarities to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) caused much concern for both human and animal health as potential for interspecies transmission was initially unknown. The goal of this study was to develop a real-time RT-PCR test for the detection and differentiation of 2009 pH1N1 and endemic influenza A viruses in North America. Matrix (M) gene sequences from U.S. human pH1N1 cases and U.S. SIVs were aligned to determine a suitable region for an assay target. Primers were selected to amplify all influenza A. Two probes were designed to differentiate pH1N1 (EA matrix) from endemic (NA matrix) SIVs. The assay was validated using the first U.S. pH1N1 strain, 10 human pH1N1-positive specimens and nine U.S. SIV isolates, then evaluated on 165 specimens of swine and other animal origin submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results were compared to other influenza A PCR assays. Sequences from additional pH1N1 strains and contemporary H1N1 SIVs were used to assess robustness of the selected primers and probes for the intended purpose. The new assay's results from clinical specimens concurred with confirmatory PCR testing. The additional probe designed from sequence analysis improved detection of the NA matrix subtype when added to the reaction mixture. This assay detects and differentiates pH1N1 and US influenza A viruses in various sample matrices and species. Good bioinformatics support is critical when designing RT-PCR assays and monitoring their performance.

Reason: The paper describes development of a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of influenza viruses, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects influenza A and types simultaneously for influenza A H1N1 (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009).
Abstract: Influenza A H1N1 (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of influenza A and differentiation of influenza A H1N1 (2009) and seasonal influenza A is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of influenza A H1N1 (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all influenza A viruses and type simultaneously for influenza A H1N1 (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of influenza A, influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for influenza A this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study develops a real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and typing of influenza viruses and antiviral resistance but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of the influenza A replicon for transient expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells.
Abstract: Recombinant protein expression in mammalian cells has become a very important technique over the last twenty years. It is mainly used for production of complex proteins for biopharmaceutical applications. Transient recombinant protein expression is a possible strategy to produce high quality material for preclinical trials within days. Viral replicon based expression systems have been established over the years and are ideal for transient protein expression. In this study we describe the evaluation of an influenza A replicon for the expression of recombinant proteins. We investigated transfection and expression levels in HEK-293 cells with EGFP and firefly luciferase as reporter proteins. Furthermore, we studied the influence of different influenza non-coding regions and temperature optima for protein expression as well. Additionally, we exploited the viral replication machinery for the expression of an antiviral protein, the human monoclonal anti-HIV-gp41 antibody 3D6. Finally we could demonstrate that the expression of a single secreted protein, an antibody light chain, by the influenza replicon, resulted in fivefold higher expression levels compared to the usually used CMV promoter based expression. We emphasize that the influenza A replicon system is feasible for high level expression of complex proteins in mammalian cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates an influenza A replicon system for recombinant protein expression in mammalian cells, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza virus in migratory water birds in eastern Hokkaido, Japan.
Abstract: The epidemiological information has obtained on avian influenza virus (AIV) in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, where AIV surveillance has not been performed. Cloacal or fecal samples obtained from migratory water birds were screened for AIV both by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the influenza A virus matrix (M) gene and by egg inoculation. Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 2,488 samples were collected from various avian species in Abashiri, Kushiro, Nemuro and Tokachi districts of eastern Hokkaido. AIVs were isolated from 18 of those samples (0.7%). No AIV was isolated from the 1,449 samples collected in Abashiri, Kushiro and Nemuro districts, although 6 were positive for the M gene by RRT-PCR. In contrast, 52 (5.0%) of the 1,039 samples collected from ducks in Tokachi district were M gene positive; AIVs were isolated from 18 of those samples (1.7%). The isolates included H3N5 (1 isolate), H3N6 (1), H3N8 (9), H4N2 (1), H4N6 (2), H6N5 (1), H6N8 (1), and H11N3 (2) subtypes. H3N5 and H11N3 subtypes have not been frequently isolated, and our study is the first to report H3N5 and the second to report H11N3 in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the M genes of all isolates belonged to the Eurasian lineage.
Relevant: False
Reason: This surveillance study reports avian influenza virus subtypes and phylogenetic analysis but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Suppression of innate immune pathology by regulatory T cells during Influenza A virus infection of immunodeficient mice.
Abstract: The viral infection of higher vertebrates elicits potent innate and adaptive host immunity. However, an excessive or inappropriate immune response also may lead to host pathology that often is more severe than the direct effects of viral replication. Therefore, several mechanisms exist that regulate the magnitude and class of the immune response. Here, we have examined the potential involvement of regulatory T (Treg) cells in limiting pathology induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Using lymphocyte-deficient mice as hosts, we showed that Treg cell reconstitution resulted in a significant delay in weight loss and prolonged survival following infection. The adoptively transferred Treg cells did not affect the high rate of IAV replication in the lungs of lymphocyte-deficient hosts, and therefore their disease-ameliorating effect was mediated through the suppression of innate immune pathology. Mechanistically, Treg cells reduced the accumulation and altered the distribution of monocytes/macrophages in the lungs of IAV-infected hosts. This reduction in lung monocytosis was associated with a specific delay in monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) induction in the infected lungs. Nevertheless, Treg cells failed to prevent the eventual development of severe disease in lymphocyte-deficient hosts, which likely was caused by the ongoing IAV replication. Indeed, using T-cell-deficient mice, which mounted a T-cell-independent B cell response to IAV, we further showed that the combination of virus-neutralizing antibodies and transferred Treg cells led to the complete prevention of clinical disease following IAV infection. Taken together, these results suggested that innate immune pathology and virus-induced pathology are the two main contributors to pathogenesis during IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on immune regulation and pathology during influenza infection without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Insights into the evolution and emergence of a novel infectious disease.
Abstract: Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if R₀ = 1.4 or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses mathematical models to study emergence and adaptation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza activity --- United States and worldwide, June 13-September 25, 2010.
Abstract: From June 13 to September 25, 2010, the United States experienced low levels of influenza activity. During this period, typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity occurred in the Southern Hemisphere; in addition, influenza activity was observed in the tropical regions, with a mix of 2009 influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses cocirculating. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide since the update published on July 30, 2010.

Title: Chemokine receptor 5 △32 allele in patients with severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009.
Abstract: Because chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may have a role in pulmonary immune response, we explored whether patients with severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were more likely to carry the CCR5Δ32 allele than were members of the general population. We found a large proportion of heterozygosity for the CCR5Δ32 allele among white patients with severe disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host genetic factors (CCR5Δ32 allele) in disease severity, not viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Influenza A virus replication induces cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase.
Abstract: Many viruses interact with the host cell division cycle to favor their own growth. In this study, we examined the ability of influenza A virus to manipulate cell cycle progression. Our results show that influenza A virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) replication results in G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation of infected cells and that this accumulation is caused by the prevention of cell cycle entry from G(0)/G(1) phase into S phase. Consistent with the G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation, the amount of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, a necessary active form for cell cycle progression through late G(1) into S phase, decreased after infection with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. In addition, other key molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as p21, cyclin E, and cyclin D1, were also changed and showed a pattern of G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. It is interesting that increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in cells synchronized in the G(0)/G(1) phase were observed compared to those in either unsynchronized cells or cells synchronized in the G(2)/M phase. G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest is likely a common strategy, since the effect was also observed in other strains, such as H3N2, H9N2, PR8 H1N1, and pandemic swine H1N1 viruses. These findings, in all, suggest that influenza A virus may provide favorable conditions for viral protein accumulation and virus production by inducing a G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest in infected cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the effect of influenza A virus replication on host cell cycle progression without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Structure of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complexes and their packaging into virions.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNAs. Each viral RNA (vRNA) segment forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex together with NPs and a polymerase complex, which is a fundamental unit for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Although the exact structure of the intact RNP remains poorly understood, recent electron microscopic studies have revealed certain structural characteristics of the RNP. This review focuses on the findings of these various electron microscopic analyses of RNPs extracted from virions and RNPs inside virions. Based on the morphological and structural observations, we present the architecture of RNPs within a virion and discuss the genome packaging mechanism by which the vRNA segments are incorporated into virions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a structural review of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complexes and genome packaging, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Macaque proteome response to highly pathogenic avian influenza and 1918 reassortant influenza virus infections.
Abstract: The host proteome response and molecular mechanisms that drive disease in vivo during infection by a human isolate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) and 1918 pandemic influenza virus remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive characterization of the proteome response in cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) lung tissue over 7 days of infection with HPAI (the most virulent), a reassortant virus containing 1918 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins (intermediate virulence), or a human seasonal strain (least virulent). A high-sensitivity two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy strategy and functional network analysis were implemented to gain insight into response pathways activated in macaques during influenza virus infection. A macaque protein database was assembled and used in the identification of 35,239 unique peptide sequences corresponding to approximately 4,259 proteins. Quantitative analysis identified an increase in expression of 400 proteins during viral infection. The abundance levels of a subset of these 400 proteins produced strong correlations with disease progression observed in the macaques, distinguishing a "core" response to viral infection from a "high" response specific to severe disease. Proteome expression profiles revealed distinct temporal response kinetics between viral strains, with HPAI inducing the most rapid response. While proteins involved in the immune response, metabolism, and transport were increased rapidly in the lung by HPAI, the other viruses produced a delayed response, characterized by an increase in proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, RNA processing, and translation. Proteomic results were integrated with previous genomic and pathological analysis to characterize the dynamic nature of the influenza virus infection process.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes host proteome responses to infection by different influenza strains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Heterocellular induction of interferon by negative-sense RNA viruses.
Abstract: The infection of cells by RNA viruses is associated with the recognition of virus PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and the production of type I interferon (IFN). To counter this, most, if not all, RNA viruses encode antagonists of the IFN system. Here we present data on the dynamics of IFN production and response during developing infections by paramyxoviruses, influenza A virus and bunyamwera virus. We show that only a limited number of infected cells are responsible for the production of IFN, and that this heterocellular production is a feature of the infecting virus as opposed to an intrinsic property of the cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies interferon induction dynamics during RNA virus infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Quantitative analysis of influenza M2 channel blockers.
Abstract: The influenza M2 H(+) channel enables the concomitant acidification of the viral lumen upon endosomic internalization. This process is critical to the viral infectivity cycle, demonstrated by the fact that M2 is one of only two targets for anti-flu agents. However, aminoadamantyls that block the M2 channel are of limited therapeutic use due to the emergence of resistance mutations in the protein. Herein, using an assay that involves expression of the protein in Escherichia coli with resultant growth retardation, we present quantitative measurements of channel blocker interactions. Comparison of detailed K(s) measurements of different drugs for several influenza channels, shows that the swine flu M2 exhibits the highest resistance to aminoadamantyls of any channel known to date. From the perspective of the blocker, we show that rimantadine is consistently a better blocker of M2 than amantadine. Taken together, such detailed and quantitative analyses provide insight into the mechanism of this important and pharmaceutically relevant channel blocker system.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper quantitatively analyzes influenza M2 channel blockers but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mice lacking both TNF and IL-1 receptors exhibit reduced lung inflammation and delay in onset of death following infection with a highly virulent H5N1 virus.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype continue to cross the species barrier to infect humans and cause severe disease. It has been suggested that an exaggerated immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infection in mammals. In particular, H5N1 virus infections are associated with a high expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We investigated the compounding affects of both cytokines on the outcome of H5N1 virus disease by using triple mutant mice deficient in 3 signaling receptors, TNF-R1, TNF-R2, and IL-1-RI. Triple mutant mice exhibited reduced morbidity and a significant delay in mortality following lethal challenge with a lethal H5N1 virus, whereas no such differences were observed with the less virulent A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. H5N1-infected triple mutant mice displayed diminished cytokine production in lung tissue and a quantifiable decrease of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs postinfection. Moreover, morphometric analysis of airway sections revealed less extensive inflammation in H5N1-infected triple mutant mice, compared with infected wild-type mice. The combined signaling from the TNF or IL-1 receptors promotes maximal lung inflammation that may contribute to the severity of disease caused by H5N1 virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host immune response in mice lacking certain cytokine receptors after H5N1 infection, focusing on host phenotype without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The cytoplasmic location of chicken mx is not the determining factor for its lack of antiviral activity.
Abstract: Chicken Mx belongs to the Mx family of interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPases, which in some species possess potent antiviral properties. Conflicting data exist for the antiviral capability of chicken Mx. Reports of anti-influenza activity of alleles encoding an Asn631 polymorphism have not been supported by subsequent studies. The normal cytoplasmic localisation of chicken Mx may influence its antiviral capacity. Here we report further studies to determine the antiviral potential of chicken Mx against Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an economically important cytoplasmic RNA virus of chickens, and Thogoto virus, an orthomyxovirus known to be exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic MxA protein from humans. We also report the consequences of re-locating chicken Mx to the nucleus. Chicken Mx was tested in virus infection assays using NDV. Neither the Asn631 nor Ser631 Mx alleles (when transfected into 293T cells) showed inhibition of virus-directed gene expression when the cells were subsequently infected with NDV. Human MxA however did show significant inhibition of NDV-directed gene expression. Chicken Mx failed to inhibit a Thogoto virus (THOV) minireplicon system in which the cytoplasmic human MxA protein showed potent and specific inhibition. Relocalisation of chicken Mx to the nucleus was achieved by inserting the Simian Virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localisation sequence (SV40 NLS) at the N-terminus of chicken Mx. Nuclear re-localised chicken Mx did not inhibit influenza (A/PR/8/34) gene expression during virus infection in cell culture or influenza polymerase activity in A/PR/8/34 or A/Turkey/50-92/91 minireplicon systems. The chicken Mx protein (Asn631) lacks inhibitory effects against THOV and NDV, and is unable to suppress influenza replication when artificially re-localised to the cell nucleus. Thus, the natural cytoplasmic localisation of the chicken Mx protein does not account for its lack of antiviral activity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral activity of chicken Mx protein variants but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors on upper and lower respiratory tract in horses and dogs.
Abstract: It is strongly suspected that equine influenza virus (EIV) is the origin of canine influenza virus (CIV, H3N8), which was first isolated in U.S.A. in 2004, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses. Although the distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors seems to be associated with this interspecies transmission, there have been scant data of comparison about distributions of sialoreceptors on the whole respiratory tract between horses and dogs. We examined the histological distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors on the upper and lower respiratory tract in detail in both animals using double lectin staining with Maackia amurensis (specific for SAα2,3Gal) and Sambucus sieboldiana (specific for SAα2,6Gal). SAα2,3Gal was observed on the surface of ciliated epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa, trachea and bronchus in both animals. The results may indicate that dogs are susceptible to EIV without alteration of receptor binding specificity.

Systematic surveillance is required to monitor the disease and evolutionary behavior of this virus in canine populations in China.

Title: What happened after the initial global spread of pandemic human influenza virus A (H1N1)? A population genetics approach.
Abstract: Viral population evolution dynamics of influenza A is crucial for surveillance and control. In this paper we analyzed viral genetic features during the recent pandemic caused by the new influenza human virus A H1N1, using a conventional population genetics approach based on 4689 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences available in GenBank submitted between March and December of 2009. This analysis showed several relevant aspects: a) a scarce initial genetic variability within the viral isolates from some countries that increased along 2009 when influenza was dispersed around the world; b) a worldwide virus polarized behavior identified when comparing paired countries, low differentiation and high gene flow were found in some pairs and high differentiation and moderate or scarce gene flow in others, independently of their geographical closeness, c) lack of positive selection in HA and NA due to increase of the population size of virus variants, d) HA and NA variants spread in a few months all over the world being identified in the same countries in different months along 2009, and e) containment of viral variants in Mexico at the beginning of the outbreak, probably due to the control measures applied by the government.

Title: Codon usage bias and the evolution of influenza A viruses. Codon Usage Biases of Influenza Virus.
Abstract: The influenza A virus is an important infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and was responsible for 3 pandemics in the 20th century. As the replication of the influenza virus is based on its host's machinery, codon usage of its viral genes might be subject to host selection pressures, especially after interspecies transmission. A better understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive responses might help control this disease. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values of the genes from segment 1 to segment 6 of avian and human influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1, were studied via Correspondence Analysis (CA). The codon usage patterns of seasonal human influenza viruses were distinct among their subtypes and different from those of avian viruses. Newly isolated viruses could be added to the CA results, creating a tool to investigate the host origin and evolution of viral genes. It was found that the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus contained genes with mammalian-like viral codon usage patterns, indicating that the introduction of this virus to humans was not through in toto transfer of an avian influenza virus.Many human viral genes had directional changes in codon usage over time of viral isolation, indicating the effect of host selection pressures. These changes reduced the overall GC content and the usage of G at the third codon position in the viral genome. Limited evidence of translational selection pressure was found in a few viral genes. Codon usage patterns from CA allowed identification of host origin and evolutionary trends in influenza viruses, providing an alternative method and a tool to understand the evolution of influenza viruses. Human influenza viruses are subject to selection pressure on codon usage which might assist in understanding the characteristics of newly emerging viruses.

Title: Evaluation of an edible blue-green alga, Aphanothece sacrum, for its inhibitory effect on replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 and influenza virus type A.
Abstract: A hot-water extract of Aphanothece sacrum, an edible aquacultured blue-green alga, was found to show a remarkable inhibitory effect on the replication of enveloped viruses including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and influenza virus type A (IFV-A, H1N1) in vitro. The main active components were suggested to be sulfated polysaccharides in non-dialyzable portion (ASWPH). ASWPH was found to inhibit the viral adsorption to the receptor of the host cells involved in the replication process of HSV-2 and IFV-A. In addition, while the penetration stage of HSV-2 was also significantly suppressed with ASWPH, no such effect was observed in the replication of IFV-A. These results suggest that ASWPH might be useful in the prevention of infectious diseases caused by HSV-2 as well as IFV-A.

Title: Recombinant soluble, multimeric HA and NA exhibit distinctive types of protection against pandemic swine-origin 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus infection in ferrets.
Abstract: The emergence and subsequent swift and global spread of the swine-origin influenza virus A(H1N1) in 2009 once again emphasizes the strong need for effective vaccines that can be developed rapidly and applied safely. With this aim, we produced soluble, multimeric forms of the 2009 A(H1N1) HA (sHA(3)) and NA (sNA(4)) surface glycoproteins using a virus-free mammalian expression system and evaluated their efficacy as vaccines in ferrets. Immunization twice with 3.75-microg doses of these antigens elicited strong antibody responses, which were adjuvant dependent. Interestingly, coadministration of both antigens strongly enhanced the HA-specific but not the NA-specific responses. Distinct patterns of protection were observed upon challenge inoculation with the homologous H1N1 virus. Whereas vaccination with sHA(3) dramatically reduced virus replication (e.g., by lowering pulmonary titers by about 5 log(10) units), immunization with sNA(4) markedly decreased the clinical effects of infection, such as body weight loss and lung pathology. Clearly, optimal protection was achieved by the combination of the two antigens. Our observations demonstrate the great vaccine potential of multimeric HA and NA ectodomains, as these can be easily, rapidly, flexibly, and safely produced in high quantities. In particular, our study underscores the underrated importance of NA in influenza vaccination, which we found to profoundly and specifically contribute to protection by HA. Its inclusion in a vaccine is likely to reduce the HA dose required and to broaden the protective immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on vaccine efficacy of recombinant HA and NA proteins and their protective effects, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, 2009-10 season.
Abstract: During the 2009-10 influenza season, the second wave of influenza activity from 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred in the United States; few seasonal influenza viruses were detected. Influenza activity peaked in late-October and was associated with higher pediatric mortality and higher rates of hospitalizations in children and young adults than in previous seasons. The proportion of visits to health-care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI), as reported in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), was among the highest since ILI surveillance began in 1997 in its current form. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2009-10 influenza season (August 30, 2009-June 12, 2010).

Title: Activation of the innate immune system provides broad-spectrum protection against influenza A viruses with pandemic potential in mice.
Abstract: The efficacy of a stabilized chemical analog of double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA), PIKA, as prophylaxis against infection with 5 different influenza A virus subtypes, including the 2009 swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus, was evaluated in mice. Intranasal treatment with PIKA resulted in a significant reduction of viral replication in the respiratory tract. The inhibitory effect was mediated by rapid infiltration of immune cells into the lungs, and production of inflammatory cytokines. While TLR3 is important for the optimal production of these inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of viral replication was still observed in TLR3(-/-) mice. In addition, a significant synergistic effect in inhibiting H5N1 virus replication was observed when PIKA was coadministered with oseltamivir. The broad-spectrum protection provided by PIKA makes it an attractive option for prophylaxis from infection with influenza A viruses.

Title: Seroprevalence following the second wave of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
Abstract: In April 2009, a new pandemic strain of influenza infected thousands of persons in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly worldwide. During the ensuing summer months, cases ebbed in the Northern Hemisphere while the Southern Hemisphere experienced a typical influenza season dominated by the novel strain. In the fall, a second wave of pandemic H1N1 swept through the United States, peaking in most parts of the country by mid October and returning to baseline levels by early December. The objective was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain by decade of birth among Pittsburgh-area residents. Anonymous blood samples were obtained from clinical laboratories and categorized by decade of birth from 1920-2009. Using hemagglutination-inhibition assays, approximately 100 samples per decade (n = 846) were tested from blood samples drawn on hospital and clinic patients in mid-November and early December 2009. Age specific seroprevalences against pandemic H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) were measured and compared to seroprevalences against H1N1 strains that had previously circulated in the population in 2007, 1957, and 1918. (A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Denver/1/1957, and A/South Carolina/1/1918). Stored serum samples from healthy, young adults from 2008 were used as a control group (n = 100). Seroprevalences against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza varied by age group, with children age 10-19 years having the highest seroprevalence (45%), and persons age 70-79 years having the lowest (5%). The baseline seroprevalence among control samples from 18-24 year-olds was 6%. Overall seroprevalence against pandemic H1N1 across all age groups was approximately 21%. After the peak of the second wave of 2009 H1N1, HAI seroprevalence results suggest that 21% of persons in the Pittsburgh area had become infected and developed immunity. Extrapolating to the entire US population, we estimate that at least 63 million persons became infected in 2009. As was observed among clinical cases, this sero-epidemiological study revealed highest infection rates among school-age children.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a sero-epidemiological study measuring antibody prevalence after pandemic H1N1 infection, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes linked to phenotypes.

Title: Involvement of vesicular trafficking system in membrane targeting of the progeny influenza virus genome.
Abstract: The genome of influenza type A virus consists of single-stranded RNAs of negative polarity. Progeny viral RNA (vRNA) replicated in the nucleus is nuclear-exported, and finally transported to the budding site beneath the plasma membrane. However, the precise process of the membrane targeting of vRNA is unclear, although viral proteins and cytoskeleton are thought to play roles. Here, we have visualized the translocation process of progeny vRNA using fluorescence in situ hybridization method. Our results provide an evidence of the involvement of vesicular trafficking in membrane targeting of progeny vRNA independent of that of viral membrane proteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the cellular process of vesicular trafficking involved in viral RNA membrane targeting, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Type I interferons regulate cytolytic activity of memory CD8(+) T cells in the lung airways during respiratory virus challenge.
Abstract: Memory CD8(+) T cells in the lung airways provide protection from secondary respiratory virus challenge by limiting early viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that although airway-resident memory CD8(+) T cells were poorly cytolytic, memory CD8(+) T cells recruited to the airways early during a recall response showed markedly enhanced cytolytic ability. This enhanced lytic activity did not require cognate antigen stimulation, but rather was dependent on STAT1 transcription factor signaling through the interferon-alpha receptor (Ifnar1), resulting in the antigen-independent expression of granzyme B protein in both murine and human virus-specific T cells. Signaling through Ifnar1 was required for the enhanced lytic activity and control of early viral replication by memory CD8(+) T cells in the lung airways. These findings demonstrate that innate inflammatory signals act directly on memory T cells, enabling them to rapidly destroy infected host cells once they enter infected tissues.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host immune cell regulation during respiratory virus challenge, focusing on host cell signaling and T cell activity rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system affects influenza A virus infection at a postfusion step.
Abstract: We have demonstrated that influenza A virus (IAV) RNA synthesis depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. IAV replication was reduced both by proteasome inhibitors and in E36ts20 cells, which contain the thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. While virus entry was not affected in E36ts20 cells, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 retained viral particles in the cytoplasm. Addition-removal experiments of MG132 in combination with bafilomycin A1, a well-established inhibitor of IAV entry and fusion, showed that MG132 affected IAV infection at a postfusion step. This was confirmed by the lack of inhibition of IAV entry by proteasome inhibitors in a virus-like particle fusion assay.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of proteasome inhibition on influenza A virus infection steps, focusing on host cell processes rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: OpenFluDB, a database for human and animal influenza virus.
Abstract: Although research on influenza lasted for more than 100 years, it is still one of the most prominent diseases causing half a million human deaths every year. With the recent observation of new highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N7 strains, and the appearance of the influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 swine-like lineage, a collaborative effort to share observations on the evolution of this virus in both animals and humans has been established. The OpenFlu database (OpenFluDB) is a part of this collaborative effort. It contains genomic and protein sequences, as well as epidemiological data from more than 27,000 isolates. The isolate annotations include virus type, host, geographical location and experimentally tested antiviral resistance. Putative enhanced pathogenicity as well as human adaptation propensity are computed from protein sequences. Each virus isolate can be associated with the laboratories that collected, sequenced and submitted it. Several analysis tools including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity maps enable rapid and efficient mining. The contents of OpenFluDB are supplied by direct user submission, as well as by a daily automatic procedure importing data from public repositories. Additionally, a simple mechanism facilitates the export of OpenFluDB records to GenBank. This resource has been successfully used to rapidly and widely distribute the sequences collected during the recent human swine flu outbreak and also as an exchange platform during the vaccine selection procedure.

Title: Monoclonal antibody-assisted structure-function analysis of the carbohydrate recognition domain of surfactant protein D.
Abstract: Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in host defense against a variety of pathogens including influenza A virus (IAV). Ligand binding by SP-D is mediated by the trimeric neck and carbohydrate recognition domain (NCRD). We used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human SP-D and a panel of mutant collectin NCRD constructs to identify functionally and structurally important epitopes. The ability of SP-D to bind to IAV and mannan involved partially overlapping binding sites that are distinct from those involved in binding to the glycoprotein-340 (gp-340) scavenger receptor protein. A species-specific motif (D324,D325,R343), which has been implicated in the specific binding of several ligands, contributes to recognition by mAbs that block antiviral or mannan binding activity. D325, in particular, is involved in the epitopes of these blocking mAbs. Conversely, the interspecies substitution of arginine for Lys343 in the rat NCRD (rK343R) conferred binding to two of the mAbs. The single site substitution of alanine for R349 or E347 resulted in highly selective alterations in mAb binding and caused decreased antiviral activity. Mutations at Glu333 (E333A), Trp340 (W340F), and Phe335 (F335A), which abrogated antiviral activity, were associated with decreased binding to multiple blocking mAbs, consistent with critical structural roles. More conservative substitutions at 335, which showed a significant increase in neutralization activity, caused selective loss of binding to one mAb. The analysis reveals, for the first time, an extended binding site for IAV; calcium-dependent antiviral activity involves residues flanking the primary carbohydrate binding site as well as more remote residues displayed on the carbohydrate recognition domain surface.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on structure-function analysis of surfactant protein D and its binding to influenza A virus, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Repository of Eurasian influenza A virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase reverse genetics vectors and recombinant viruses.
Abstract: Reverse genetics can be used to produce recombinant influenza A viruses containing virtually every desired combination of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes using the virus backbone of choice. Here, a repository of plasmids and recombinant viruses representing all contemporary Eurasian HA and NA subtypes, H1-H16 and N1-N9, was established. HA and NA genes were selected based on sequence analyses of influenza virus genes available from public databases. Prototype Eurasian HA and NA genes were cloned in bidirectional reverse genetics plasmids. Recombinant viruses based on the virus backbone of A/PR/8/34, and containing a variety of HA and NA genes were produced in 293T cells. Virus stocks were produced in MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs. These plasmids and viruses may be useful for numerous purposes, including influenza virus research projects, vaccination studies, and to serve as reference reagents in diagnostic settings.
Relevant: False

Title: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza community transmission was established in one Australian state when the virus was first identified in North America.
Abstract: In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.

Title: Increasing antiviral activity of surfactant protein d trimers by introducing residues from bovine serum collectins: dissociation of mannan-binding and antiviral activity.
Abstract: Collectins contribute to host defence through interactions with glycoconjugates on pathogen surfaces. We have prepared recombinant trimeric neck and carbohydrate recognition domains (NCRD) of collectins, and we now show that the NCRD of bovine conglutinin and CL-46 (like that of CL-43) have greater intrinsic antiviral activity for influenza A virus (IAV) than the human SP-D NCRD (hSP-D-NCRD). The three serum collectins differ from SP-D by having insertions adjacent to amino acid 325 and substitution of hydrophobic residues for arginine 343. We previously showed that a three amino acid (RAK) insertion, as found in CL-43, increases antiviral activity and mannan-binding activity of the hSP-D-NCRD, while the substitution of valine at 343, as in conglutinin, more strongly increased these activities. Mannan-binding activity of collectins has been considered to predict for ability to bind to high mannose glycans on viruses or other pathogens. We now show, however, that combined mutants containing the RAK insertion and R343V or R343I substitutions have greatly increased mannan-binding ability, but lower IAV binding or inhibiting activity than mutants containing R343V or R343I substitutions only. These findings indicate differences in the recognition of glycan structures of mannan and IAV by the NCRD and emphasize the importance of the flanking sequences in determining the differing interactions of human SP-D and bovine serum collectins with mannose-rich glycoconjugates on IAV and other pathogens. Of interest, we show conservation of some monoclonal antibody-binding epitopes between bovine collectin NCRD and hSP-D, suggesting shared structural motifs.

Title: Zoonotic transmission of avian influenza virus (H5N1), Egypt, 2006-2009.
Abstract: During March 2006-March 2009, a total of 6,355 suspected cases of avian influenza (H5N1) were reported to the Ministry of Health in Egypt. Sixty-three (1%) patients had confirmed infections; 24 (38%) died. Risk factors for death included female sex, age > or = 15 years, and receiving the first dose of oseltamivir >2 days after illness onset. All but 2 case-patients reported exposure to domestic poultry probably infected with avian influenza virus (H5N1). No cases of human-to-human transmission were found. Greatest risks for infection and death were reported among women > or = 15 years of age, who accounted for 38% of infections and 83% of deaths. The lower case-fatality rate in Egypt could be caused by a less virulent virus clade. However, the lower mortality rate seems to be caused by the large number of infected children who were identified early, received prompt treatment, and had less severe clinical disease.

Title: Dogs are highly susceptible to H5N1 avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Replication of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in dogs may facilitate their adaptation in humans; however, the data to date on H5N1 influenza virus infection in dogs are conflicting. To elucidate the susceptibility of dogs to this pathogen, we infected two groups of 6 beagles with 10(6) 50% egg-infectious dose of H5N1 AIV A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/05 (BHG/QH/3/05) intranasally (i.n.) and intratracheally (i.t.), respectively. The dogs showed disease symptoms, including anorexia, fever, conjunctivitis, labored breathing and cough, and one i.t. inoculated animal died on day 4 post-infection. Virus shedding was detected from all 6 animals inoculated i.n. and one inoculated i.t. Virus replication was detected in all animals that were euthanized on day 3 or day 5 post-infection and in the animal that died on day 4 post-infection. Our results demonstrate that dogs are highly susceptible to H5N1 AIV and may serve as an intermediate host to transfer this virus to humans.

Title: Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of H7N3 avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in Pakistan 1995-2004.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) infections have caused heavy economic losses to the poultry industry in Pakistan as well as numerous other regions worldwide. The first introduction of H7N3 AIV to Pakistan occurred during 1995, since then H7N3, H9N2 and H5N1 AIVs have each been sporadically isolated. This report evaluates the genetic origin of the H7N3 viruses from Pakistan collected 1995-2004 and how they disseminated within the country. To accomplish this we produced whole genome sequences for 6 H7N3 viruses and data for the HA and NA genes of an additional 7 isolates. All available sequence from H7N3 AIV from Pakistan was included in the analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there were two introductions of H7 into Pakistan and one N3 introduction. Only one of the H7 introductions appears to have become established in poultry in Pakistan, while the other was isolated from two separate outbreaks 6 years apart. The data also shows that reassortment has occurred between H7N3 and H9N2 viruses in the field, likely during co-infection of poultry. Also, with the exception of these few reassortant isolates, all 8 genes in the predominant H7N3 virus lineage have evolved to be phylogenetically distinct. Although rigorous control measures have been implemented in commercial poultry in Pakistan, AIV is sporadically transmitted to poultry and among the different poultry industry compartments (broilers, broiler breeders, table egg layers). Since there is one primary H7 lineage which persists and that has reassorted with the H9N2 AIV in poultry, it suggests that there is a reservoir with some link commercial poultry. On a general level, this offers insight into the molecular ecology of AIV in poultry where the virus has persisted despite vaccination and biosecurity. This data also illustrates the importance of sustained surveillance for AIVs in poultry.

Title: The re-emergence of H1N1 influenza virus in 1977: a cautionary tale for estimating divergence times using biologically unrealistic sampling dates.
Abstract: In 1977, H1N1 influenza A virus reappeared after a 20-year absence. Genetic analysis indicated that this strain was missing decades of nucleotide sequence evolution, suggesting an accidental release of a frozen laboratory strain into the general population. Recently, this strain and its descendants were included in an analysis attempting to date the origin of pandemic influenza virus without accounting for the missing decades of evolution. Here, we investigated the effect of using viral isolates with biologically unrealistic sampling dates on estimates of divergence dates. Not accounting for missing sequence evolution produced biased results and increased the variance of date estimates of the most recent common ancestor of the re-emergent lineages and across the entire phylogeny. Reanalysis of the H1N1 sequences excluding isolates with unrealistic sampling dates indicates that the 1977 re-emergent lineage was circulating for approximately one year before detection, making it difficult to determine the geographic source of reintroduction. We suggest that a new method is needed to account for viral isolates with unrealistic sampling dates.

Title: Reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza A virus in swine.
Abstract: The emergence of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza demonstrated that pandemic viruses could be generated in swine. Subsequent reintroduction of H1N1/2009 to swine has occurred in multiple countries. Through systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine from a Hong Kong abattoir, we characterize a reassortant progeny of H1N1/2009 with swine viruses. Swine experimentally infected with this reassortant developed mild illness and transmitted infection to contact animals. Continued reassortment of H1N1/2009 with swine influenza viruses could produce variants with transmissibility and altered virulence for humans. Global systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine is warranted.

Title: Oseltamivir ring prophylaxis for containment of 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreaks.
Abstract: From June 22 through June 25, 2009, four outbreaks of infection with the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus occurred in Singapore military camps. We report the efficacy of ring chemoprophylaxis (geographically targeted containment by means of prophylaxis) with oseltamivir to control outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 influenza in semiclosed environments. All personnel with suspected infection were tested and clinically isolated if infection was confirmed. In addition, we administered postexposure ring chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir and segregated the affected military units to contain the spread of the virus. All personnel were screened three times weekly both for virologic infection, by means of nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay with sequencing, and for clinical symptoms, by means of questionnaires. A total of 1175 personnel were at risk across the four sites, with 1100 receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis. A total of 75 personnel (6.4%) were infected before the intervention, and 7 (0.6%) after the intervention. There was a significant reduction in the overall reproductive number (the number of new cases attributable to the index case), from 1.91 (95% credible interval, 1.50 to 2.36) before the intervention to 0.11 (95% credible interval, 0.05 to 0.20) after the intervention. Three of the four outbreaks showed a significant reduction in the rate of infection after the intervention. Molecular analysis revealed that all four outbreaks were derived from the New York lineage of the 2009 H1N1 virus and that cases within each outbreak were due to transmission rather than unrelated episodes of infection. Of the 816 personnel treated with oseltamivir who were surveyed, 63 (7.7%) reported mild, nonrespiratory side effects of the drug, with no severe adverse events. Oseltamivir ring chemoprophylaxis, together with prompt identification and isolation of infected personnel, was effective in reducing the impact of outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 influenza in semiclosed settings.

Title: Reconstructing disease outbreaks from genetic data: a graph approach.
Abstract: Epidemiology and public health planning will increasingly rely on the analysis of genetic sequence data. In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain. The presented methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.

Title: Molecular evolutionary analysis of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm, May-September, 2009: temporal and spatial spreading profile of the viruses in Japan.
Abstract: In March 2009, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A(H1N1)pdm) emerged in Mexico and the United States. In Japan, since the first outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm in Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures occurred in the middle of May 2009, the virus had spread over 16 of 47 prefectures as of June 4, 2009. We analyzed all-segment concatenated genome sequences of 75 isolates of A(H1N1)pdm viruses in Japan, and compared them with 163 full-genome sequences in the world. Two analyzing methods, distance-based and Bayesian coalescent MCMC inferences were adopted to elucidate an evolutionary relationship of the viruses in the world and Japan. Regardless of the method, the viruses in the world were classified into four distinct clusters with a few exceptions. Cluster 1 was originated earlier than cluster 2, while cluster 2 was more widely spread around the world. The other two clusters (clusters 1.2 and 1.3) were suggested to be distinct reassortants with different types of segment assortments. The viruses in Japan seemed to be a multiple origin, which were derived from approximately 28 transported cases. Twelve cases were associated with monophyletic groups consisting of Japanese viruses, which were referred to as micro-clade. While most of the micro-clades belonged to the cluster 2, the clade of the first cases of infection in Japan originated from cluster 1.2. Micro-clades of Osaka/Kobe and the Fukuoka cases, both of which were school-wide outbreaks, were eradicated. Time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for each micro-clade demonstrated that some distinct viruses were transmitted in Japan between late May and early June, 2009, and appeared to spread nation-wide throughout summer. Our results suggest that many viruses were transmitted from abroad in late May 2009 irrespective of preventive actions against the pandemic influenza, and that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm had become a pandemic stage in June 2009 in Japan.

Title: Inhibitory effects of carbocisteine on type A seasonal influenza virus infection in human airway epithelial cells.
Abstract: Type A human seasonal influenza (FluA) virus infection causes exacerbations of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). l-carbocisteine, a mucolytic agent, reduces the frequency of common colds and exacerbations in COPD. However, the inhibitory effects of l-carbocisteine on FluA virus infection are uncertain. We studied the effects of l-carbocisteine on FluA virus infection in airway epithelial cells. Human tracheal epithelial cells were pretreated with l-carbocisteine and infected with FluA virus (H(3)N(2)). Viral titers in supernatant fluids, RNA of FluA virus in the cells, and concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in supernatant fluids, including IL-6, increased with time after infection. l-carbocisteine reduced viral titers in supernatant fluids, RNA of FluA virus in the cells, the susceptibility to FluA virus infection, and concentrations of cytokines induced by virus infection. The epithelial cells expressed sialic acid with an alpha2,6-linkage (SAalpha2,6Gal), a receptor for human influenza virus on the cells, and l-carbocisteine reduced the expression of SAalpha2,6Gal. l-carbocisteine reduced the number of acidic endosomes from which FluA viral RNA enters into the cytoplasm and reduced the fluorescence intensity from acidic endosomes. Furthermore, l-carbocisteine reduced NF-kappaB proteins including p50 and p65 in the nuclear extracts of the cells. These findings suggest that l-carbocisteine may inhibit FluA virus infection, partly through the reduced expression of the receptor for human influenza virus in the human airway epithelial cells via the inhibition of NF-kappaB and through increasing pH in endosomes. l-carbocisteine may reduce airway inflammation in influenza virus infection.

Title: Ecology of avian influenza viruses in a changing world.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infections result in approximately 500,000 human deaths per year and many more sublethal infections. Wild birds are recognized as the ancestral host of influenza A viruses, and avian viruses have contributed genetic material to most human viruses, including subtypes H5N1 and H1N1. Thus, influenza virus transmission in wild and domestic animals and humans is intimately connected. Here we review how anthropogenic change, including human population growth, land use, climate change, globalization of trade, agricultural intensification, and changes in vaccine technology may alter the evolution and transmission of influenza viruses. Evidence suggests that viral transmission in domestic poultry, spillover to other domestic animals, wild birds and humans, and the potential for subsequent pandemic spread, are all increasing. We highlight four areas in need of research: drivers of viral subtype dynamics; ecological and evolutionary determinants of transmissibility and virulence in birds and humans; the impact of changing land use and climate on hosts, viruses, and transmission; and the impact of influenza viruses on wild bird hosts, including their ability to migrate while shedding virus.

Title: Monoclonal antibody kit for identification of the novel 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus.
Abstract: To develop an immunofluorescence assay for identification of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, we generated a number of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by using inactivated H1N1 2009 virus (A/California/07/2009) as the immunogen. Two MAbs that target two different epitopes of the 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) were selected to make the D(3) Ultra 2009 H1N1 Influenza A ID kit (2009 H1N1 ID kit; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH), which is intended for the identification of the 2009 H1N1 virus by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The kit does not detect any of 14 seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 prototype influenza virus strains and is also not reactive with seven other major respiratory viruses. Clinical respiratory specimens were evaluated using both the 2009 H1N1 ID kit and the CDC human influenza virus real-time reverse transcription-PCR swine flu panel (CDC rRT-PCR) and showed 100% agreement between the two assays. Four of these clinical specimens, however, were positive by the 2009 H1N1 ID kit but were identified as presumptively positive by the CDC rRT-PCR by virtue of showing threshold cycle (C(T)) values only with universal InfA and swInfA primers, not with swH1 primers. Sequence analysis of the HA genes of these four specimens revealed point mutations in both the primer and probe regions. In addition, unlike the CDC rRT-PCR, the 2009 H1N1 ID kit can differentiate the 2009 H1N1 virus from a swine-derived H1 influenza A virus (A/New Jersey/8/76). The 2009 H1N1 ID kit offers clinical laboratories an alternative to RT-PCR for the identification of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus.

Title: A nine-segment influenza a virus carrying subtype H1 and H3 hemagglutinins.
Abstract: Influenza virus genomic RNAs possess segment-specific packaging signals that include both noncoding regions (NCRs) and adjacent terminal coding region sequences. Using reverse genetics, an A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR/8/34) virus was rescued that contained a modified PB1 gene such that the PB1 packaging sequences were exchanged for those of the neuraminidase (NA) gene segment. To accomplish this, the PB1 open reading frame, in which the terminal packaging signals were inactivated by serial synonymous mutations, was flanked by the NA segment-specific packaging sequences including the NCRs and the coding region packaging signals. Next, the ATGs located on the 3' end of the NA packaging sequences of the resulting PB1 chimeric segment were mutated to allow for correct translation of the full-length PB1 protein. The virus containing this chimeric PB1 segment was viable and able to stably carry a ninth, green fluorescent protein (GFP), segment flanked by PB1 packaging signals. Utilizing this method, we successfully generated an influenza virus that contained the genes coding for both the H1 hemagglutinin (HA) from A/PR/8/34 and the H3 HA from A/Hong Kong/1/68 (A/HK/1/68); both subtypes of HA protein were also incorporated into the viral envelope. Immunization of mice with this recombinant virus conferred complete protection from lethal challenge with recombinant A/PR/8/34 virus and with X31 virus that expresses the A/HK/1/68 HA and NA. Using the described methodology, we show that a ninth segment can also be incorporated by manipulation of the PB2 or PA segment-specific packaging signals. This approach offers a means of generating a bivalent influenza virus vaccine.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic engineering of influenza virus segments and vaccine development, without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: FAO-OIE-WHO Joint Technical Consultation on Avian Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface.
Abstract: For the past 10 years, animal health experts and human health experts have been gaining experience in the technical aspects of avian influenza in mostly separate fora. More recently, in 2006, in a meeting of the small WHO Working Group on Influenza Research at the Human Animal Interface (Meeting report available from: http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_EPR_GIP_2006_3/en/index.html) in Geneva allowed influenza experts from the animal and public health sectors to discuss together the most recent avian influenza research. Ad hoc bilateral discussions on specific technical issues as well as formal meetings such as the Technical Meeting on HPAI and Human H5N1 Infection (Rome, June, 2007; information available from: http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/conferences/june2007/index.html) have increasingly brought the sectors together and broadened the understanding of the topics of concern to each sector. The sectors have also recently come together at the broad global level, and have developed a joint strategy document for working together on zoonotic diseases (Joint strategy available from: ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/ajl37e/ajl37e00.pdf). The 2008 FAO-OIE-WHO Joint Technical Consultation on Avian Influenza at the Human Animal Interface described here was the first opportunity for a large group of influenza experts from the animal and public health sectors to gather and discuss purely technical topics of joint interest that exist at the human-animal interface. During the consultation, three influenza-specific sessions aimed to (1) identify virological characteristics of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) important for zoonotic and pandemic disease, (2) evaluate the factors affecting evolution and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain and identify existing monitoring systems, and (3) identify modes of transmission and exposure sources for human zoonotic influenza infection (including discussion of specific exposure risks by affected countries). A final session was held to discuss broadening the use of tools and systems to other emerging zoonotic diseases. The meeting was structured as short technical presentations with substantial time available for facilitated discussion, to take advantage of the vast influenza knowledge and experience available from the invited expert participants. Particularly important was the identification of gaps in knowledge that have not yet been filled by either sector. Technical discussions focused on H5N1, but included other potentially zoonotic avian and animal influenza viruses whenever possible. During the consultation, the significant threat posed by subtypes other than H5N1 was continually emphasized in a variety of contexts. It was stressed that epidemiological and virological surveillance for these other viruses should be broadening and strengthened. The important role of live bird markets (LBMs) in amplifying and sustaining AIVs in some countries was also a recurring topic, and the need for better understanding of the role of LBMs in human zoonotic exposure and infection was noted. Much is understood about the contribution of various virus mutations and gene combinations to transmissibility, infectivity, and pathogenicity, although it was agreed that the specific constellation of gene types and mutations that would characterize a potentially pandemic virus remains unclear. The question of why only certain humans have become infected with H5N1 in the face of massive exposure in some communities was frequently raised during discussion of human exposure risks. It was suggested that individual-level factors may play a role. More research is needed to address this as well as questions of mode of transmission, behaviors associated with increased risk, virological and ecological aspects, and viral persistence in the environment in order to better elucidate specific human exposure risks. It became clear that great strides have been made in recent years in collaboration between the animal health and public health sectors, especially at the global level. In some countries outbreaks of H5N1 are being investigated jointly. Even greater transparency, cooperation, and information and materials exchange would allow more timely and effective responses in emergency situations, as well as in assessment and planning phases. Ensuring sustainability was also frequently emphasized, e.g. in infrastructure and capacity development and in development of tools and systems for surveillance, assessment and response. It was suggested that one way for tools and systems built or planned to address avian influenza to become more sustainable would be to make them applicable for a broader array of existing and emerging zoonotic diseases.

Title: Formation of virus-like particles from human cell lines exclusively expressing influenza neuraminidase.
Abstract: The minimal virus requirements for the generation of influenza virus-like particle (VLP) assembly and budding were reassessed. Using neuraminidase (NA) from the H5N1 and H1N1 subtypes, it was found that the expression of NA alone was sufficient to generate and release VLPs. Biochemical and functional characterization of the NA-containing VLPs demonstrated that they were morphologically similar to influenza virions. The NA oligomerization was comparable to that of the live virus, and the enzymic activity, whilst not required for the release of NA-VLPs, was preserved. Together, these findings indicate that NA plays a key role in virus budding and morphogenesis, and demonstrate that NA-VLPs represent a useful tool in influenza research.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on virus-like particle formation by neuraminidase expression, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Human Staufen1 protein interacts with influenza virus ribonucleoproteins and is required for efficient virus multiplication.
Abstract: The influenza A virus genome consists of 8 negative-stranded RNA segments. NS1 is a nonstructural protein that participates in different steps of the virus infectious cycle, including transcription, replication, and morphogenesis, and acts as a virulence factor. Human Staufen1 (hStau1), a protein involved in the transport and regulated translation of cellular mRNAs, was previously identified as a NS1-interacting factor. To investigate the possible role of hStau1 in the influenza virus infection, we characterized the composition of hStau1-containing granules isolated from virus-infected cells. Viral NS1 protein and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) were identified in these complexes by Western blotting, and viral mRNAs and viral RNAs (vRNAs) were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Also, colocalization of hStau1 with NS1, nucleoprotein (NP), and PA in the cytosol of virus-infected cells was shown by immunofluorescence. To analyze the role of hStau1 in the infection, we downregulated its expression by gene silencing. Human HEK293T cells or A549 cells were silenced using either short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting four independent sites in the hStau1 mRNA. The yield of influenza virus was reduced 5 to 10 times in the various hStau1-silenced cells compared to that in control silenced cells. The expression levels of viral proteins and their nucleocytoplasmic localization were not affected upon hStau1 silencing, but virus particle production, as determined by purification of virions from supernatants, was reduced. These results indicate a role for hStau1 in late events of the influenza virus infection, possibly during virus morphogenesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of a host protein in influenza virus multiplication, not direct viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Gold nanorod delivery of an ssRNA immune activator inhibits pandemic H1N1 influenza viral replication.
Abstract: The emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has become a world-wide health concern. As drug resistance appears, a new generation of therapeutic strategies will be required. Here, we introduce a nanotechnology approach for the therapy of pan-demic and seasonal influenza virus infections. This approach uses gold nanorods (GNRs) to deliver an innate immune activator, pro-ducing a localized therapeutic response. We demonstrated the utility of a biocompatible gold nanorod, GNR-5'PPP-ssRNA nanoplex, as an antiviral strategy against type A influenza virus. In human respiratory bronchial epithelial cells, this nanoplex activated the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathogen recognition pathway, resulting in increased expression of IFN-beta and other IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (e.g., PKR, MDA5, IRF1, IRF7, and MX1). This increase in type I IFN and ISGs resulted in a decrease in the replication of H1N1 influenza viruses. These findings suggest that further evaluation of biocompatible nanoplexes as unique antivirals for treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses is warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on a nanotechnology-based immune activation approach to inhibit influenza replication, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: 5'PPP-RNA induced RIG-I activation inhibits drug-resistant avian H5N1 as well as 1918 and 2009 pandemic influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Emergence of drug-resistant strains of influenza viruses, including avian H5N1 with pandemic potential, 1918 and 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic viruses to currently used antiviral agents, neuraminidase inhibitors and M2 Ion channel blockers, underscores the importance of developing novel antiviral strategies. Activation of innate immune pathogen sensor Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene-I (RIG-I) has recently been shown to induce antiviral state. In the present investigation, using real time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and plaque assay we show that 5'PPP-containing single stranded RNA (5'PPP-RNA), a ligand for the intracytoplasmic RNA sensor, RIG-I can be used as a prophylactic agent against known drug-resistant avian H5N1 and pandemic influenza viruses. 5'PPP-RNA treatment of human lung epithelial cells inhibited replication of drug-resistant avian H5N1 as well as 1918 and 2009 pandemic influenza viruses in a RIG-I and type 1 interferon dependant manner. Additionally, 5'PPP-RNA treatment also inhibited 2009 H1N1 viral replication in vivo in mice. Our findings suggest that 5'PPP-RNA mediated activation of RIG-I can suppress replication of influenza viruses irrespective of their genetic make-up, pathogenicity, and drug-sensitivity status.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies innate immune activation to inhibit influenza virus replication irrespective of viral genotype, without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Recent outbreaks of avian influenza in Japan.
Abstract: Recently Japan had three outbreaks of avian influenza (Al) in 2004, 2005 and 2007. An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was recorded in early 2004, the first for 79 years, with four farms being infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1. In 2005, 41 farms were found to be infected with AI virus subtype H5N2. In early 2007, four farms were infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1 again. In all of these outbreaks, the disease was eradicated without resorting to vaccination, through a campaign of culling, movement control of chickens in areas around infected premises, and intensive clinical and serological surveillance. This paper describes the nature of the outbreaks, the eradication measures implemented, clinical and serological surveillance techniques used, and the possible sources of infection.

Title: Guidelines for identifying homologous recombination events in influenza A virus.
Abstract: The rapid evolution of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally through a variety of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal evolution of influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of non-homologous RNA recombination. Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination. Our analysis shows that the IGSP data set contains only two phylogenetically-supported single recombinant sequences and no recombinant clades. In marked contrast, the non-IGSP data show a very large amount of potential recombination. We conclude that the presence of false positive signals in the non-IGSP data is more likely than false negatives in the IGSP data, and that given the evidence to date, homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review and methodological paper on detecting homologous recombination in influenza viruses, not presenting direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza outbreaks during World Youth Day 2008 mass gathering.
Abstract: Influenza outbreaks during mass gatherings have been rarely described, and detailed virologic assessment is lacking. An influenza outbreak occurred during World Youth Day in Sydney, Australia, July 2008 (WYD2008). We assessed epidemiologic data and respiratory samples collected from attendees who sought treatment for influenza-like illness at emergency clinics in Sydney during this outbreak. Isolated influenza viruses were compared with seasonal influenza viruses from the 2008 influenza season. From 100 infected attendees, numerous strains were identified: oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses, oseltamivir-sensitive influenza A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and strains from both influenza B lineages (B/Florida/4/2006-like and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like). Novel viruses were introduced, and pre-WYD2008 seasonal viruses were amplified. Viruses isolated at mass gatherings can have substantial, complex, and unpredictable effects on community influenza activity. Greater flexibility by public health authorities and hospitals is required to appropriately manage and contain these outbreaks.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes influenza outbreaks and virus strain diversity during a mass gathering but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, August 30, 2009-March 27, 2010, and composition of the 2010-11 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: The emergence and spread of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus resulted in substantial influenza activity in the United States throughout the summer and fall months of 2009, with activity peaking in late October. Activity declined beginning in November 2009 but continued at lower levels through March 2010. The 2009 H1N1 virus remained the dominant circulating influenza virus throughout the season; <1% of characterized viruses were seasonal influenza A (H1), A (H3), and influenza B viruses. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from August 30, 2009, the start of the 2009-10 influenza season, through March 27, 2010, and also reports on the 2010-11 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine strain selection.

Title: Glycyrrhizin inhibits highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in human macrophages.
Abstract: Hypercytokinaemia is thought to contribute to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus disease. Glycyrrhizin is known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and therefore a candidate drug for the control of H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression. Here, the effects of an approved parenteral glycyrrhizin preparation were investigated on H5N1 virus replication, H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory responses, and H5N1-induced apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Glycyrrhizin 100 μg/ml, a therapeutically achievable concentration, impaired H5N1-induced production of CXCL10, interleukin 6, and CCL5 and inhibited H5N1-induced apoptosis but did not interfere with H5N1 replication. Global inhibition of immune responses may result in the loss of control of virus replication by cytotoxic immune cells including natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. Notably, glycyrrhizin concentrations that inhibited H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression did not affect cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. Since H5N1-induced hypercytokinaemia is considered to play an important role within H5N1 pathogenesis, glycyrrhizin may complement the arsenal of potential drugs for the treatment of H5N1 disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the effect of glycyrrhizin on H5N1-induced cytokine expression and apoptosis, without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Computational study of drug binding to the membrane-bound tetrameric M2 peptide bundle from influenza A virus.
Abstract: The M2 protein of influenza A virus performs the crucial function of transporting protons to the interior of virions enclosed in the endosome. Adamantane drugs, amantadine (AMN) and rimantidine (RMN), block the proton conduction in some strains, and have been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A infections. The structures of the transmembrane (TM) region of M2 that have been solved in micelles using NMR (residues 23-60) (Schnell and Chou, 2008) and by X-ray crystallography (residues 22-46) (Stouffer et al., 2008) suggest different drug binding sites: external and internal for RMN and AMN, respectively. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the nature of the binding site and binding mode of adamantane drugs on the membrane-bound tetrameric M2-TM peptide bundles using as initial conformations the low-pH AMN-bound crystal structure, a high-pH model derived from the drug-free crystal structure, and the high-pH NMR structure. The MD simulations indicate that under both low- and high-pH conditions, AMN is stable inside the tetrameric bundle, spanning the region between residues Val27 to Gly34. At low pH the polar group of AMN is oriented toward the His37 gate, while under high-pH conditions its orientation exhibits large fluctuations. The present MD simulations also suggest that AMN and RMN molecules do not show strong affinity to the external binding sites.

Title: Extrapulmonary tissue responses in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.
Abstract: The mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood. A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection. However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), were largely limited to this group. Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.

Title: 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus replicates in human lung tissues.
Abstract: The replication activity of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in human lung cells was evaluated in this study. Twenty-two surgically removed human lung tissue samples were infected ex vivo with pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (A/California/04/2009), seasonal human H1N1 influenza virus (A/Shantou/92/09), or a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1194/04). Examination of nucleoprotein expression and viral RNA replication in the infected human lung tissue samples showed that whereas the replication of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus varied between tissue samples, overall this virus replicated more efficiently than seasonal H1N1 influenza virus but less efficiently than H5N1 influenza virus. Double-immunostaining for viral antigens and cellular markers indicated that pandemic H1N1 influenza virus replicates in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells.

Title: In vitro antiviral activity of favipiravir (T-705) against drug-resistant influenza and 2009 A(H1N1) viruses.
Abstract: Favipiravir (T-705) has previously been shown to have a potent antiviral effect against influenza virus and some other RNA viruses in both cell culture and in animal models. Currently, favipiravir is undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of influenza A and B virus infections. In this study, favipiravir was evaluated in vitro for its ability to inhibit the replication of a representative panel of seasonal influenza viruses, the 2009 A(H1N1) strains, and animal viruses with pandemic (pdm) potential (swine triple reassortants, H2N2, H4N2, avian H7N2, and avian H5N1), including viruses which are resistant to the currently licensed anti-influenza drugs. All viruses were tested in a plaque reduction assay with MDCK cells, and a subset was also tested in both yield reduction and focus inhibition (FI) assays. For the majority of viruses tested, favipiravir significantly inhibited plaque formation at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml) (50% effective concentrations [EC(50)s] of 0.19 to 22.48 muM and 0.03 to 3.53 microg/ml), and for all viruses, with the exception of a single dually resistant 2009 A(H1N1) virus, complete inhibition of plaque formation was seen at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml). Due to the 2009 pandemic and increased drug resistance in circulating seasonal influenza viruses, there is an urgent need for new drugs which target influenza. This study demonstrates that favipiravir inhibits in vitro replication of a wide range of influenza viruses, including those resistant to currently available drugs.

Title: Sorting of influenza A virus RNA genome segments after nuclear export.
Abstract: The genome of the influenza A virus consists of eight different segments. These eight segments are thought to be sorted selectively in infected cells. However, the cellular compartment where segments are sorted is not known. We examined using temperature sensitive (ts) mutant viruses and cell fusion where segments are sorted in infected cells. Different cells were infected with different ts mutant viruses, and these cells were fused. In fused cells, genome segments are mixed only in the cytoplasm, because M1 prevents their re-import into the nucleus. We made a marker ts53 virus, which has silent mutations in given segments and determined the reassortment frequency on all segments using ts1 and marker ts53. In both co-infected and fused cells, all of marker ts53 segments and ts1 segments were incorporated into progeny virions in a random fashion. These results suggest that influenza virus genome segments are sorted after nuclear export.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates genome segment sorting after nuclear export but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Comparison of egg and high yielding MDCK cell-derived live attenuated influenza virus for commercial production of trivalent influenza vaccine: in vitro cell susceptibility and influenza virus replication kinetics in permissive and semi-permissive cells.
Abstract: Currently MedImmune manufactures cold-adapted (ca) live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) from specific-pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Difficulties in production scale-up and potential exposure of chicken flocks to avian influenza viruses especially in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak have prompted evaluation and development of alternative non-egg based influenza vaccine manufacturing technologies. As part of MedImmune's effort to develop the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) using cell culture production technologies we have investigated the use of high yielding, cloned MDCK cells as a substrate for vaccine production by assessing host range and virus replication of influenza virus produced from both SPF egg and MDCK cell production technologies. In addition to cloned MDCK cells the indicator cell lines used to evaluate the impact of producing LAIV in cells on host range and replication included two human cell lines: human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and human muco-epidermoid bronchiolar carcinoma (NCI H292) cells. The influenza viruses used to infect the indicators cell lines represented both the egg and cell culture manufacturing processes and included virus strains that composed the 2006-2007 influenza seasonal trivalent vaccine (A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/05 (H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/04). Results from this study demonstrate remarkable similarity between influenza viruses representing the current commercial egg produced and developmental MDCK cell produced vaccine production platforms. MedImmune's high yielding cloned MDCK cells used for the cell culture based vaccine production were highly permissive to both egg and cell produced ca attenuated influenza viruses. Both the A549 and NCI H292 cells regardless of production system were less permissive to influenza A and B viruses than the MDCK cells. Irrespective of the indicator cell line used the replication properties were similar between egg and the cell produced influenza viruses. Based on these study results we conclude that the MDCK cell produced and egg produced vaccine strains are highly comparable.

Title: Unseasonal transmission of H3N2 influenza A virus during the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic.
Abstract: The initial wave of swine-origin influenza A virus (pandemic H1N1/09) in the United States during the spring and summer of 2009 also resulted in an increased vigilance and sampling of seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), even though they are normally characterized by very low incidence outside of the winter months. To explore the nature of virus evolution during this influenza "off-season," we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of H1N1 and H3N2 sequences sampled during April to June 2009 in New York State. Our analysis revealed that multiple lineages of both viruses were introduced and cocirculated during this time, as is typical of influenza virus during the winter. Strikingly, however, we also found strong evidence for the presence of a large transmission chain of H3N2 viruses centered on the south-east of New York State and which continued until at least 1 June 2009. These results suggest that the unseasonal transmission of influenza A viruses may be more widespread than is usually supposed.

Title: Responding to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza: the role of oseltamivir.
Abstract: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza is affecting countries in all five continents, with most cases so far having been reported in North and South America and Europe, and children and young adults being the most susceptible age groups. To date, the clinical course of disease is typically mild, with low hospitalization and mortality rates. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is susceptible to oseltamivir and, although few clinical data are yet available, current information suggests that treatment with oseltamivir appears to be beneficial. Only isolated cases of resistance to the drug have been reported to date, in keeping with the low frequency observed in clinical studies involving patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses. Current health authority guidelines recommend the use of oseltamivir in infected adults and children who have or are at elevated risk for severe disease, including pregnant women; use during the pandemic in infants < 1 year has also been authorized in Europe and a number of other countries, including the USA and Canada. Before the onset of the current pandemic, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd expanded annual production capacity for oseltamivir to 400 million treatment courses per year to meet anticipated demand. However, during an influenza pandemic, and despite increased production capabilities, resources are nonetheless likely to be initially in short supply. For this reason, Roche, in line with WHO recommendations, has advocated advance stockpiling of antivirals by governments as a pandemic preparedness measure. Between 2004 and December 2009, 350 million treatment courses were supplied to governments worldwide. Support for developing countries has been a priority. Roche has established a cluster of initiatives aimed at increasing access to Tamiflu for the world's developing economies, including, making donations to the WHO, establishing the Tamiflu Reserves Program (TRP) and sub-licensing and manufacturing contracts with local companies in Asia and Africa. Furthermore, Roche has published a document outlining how it would allocate limited supplies of Tamiflu during a pandemic, which are in line with WHO recommendations stating that 'resources should be used to provide the maximum possible health benefit'. Roche is also offering support such as reprocessing of expiring capsule stocks (in development) and shelf-life extension to support governments in the management of their stockpiles. Clinical studies, either sponsored by or supported by Roche, are in progress. These trials are designed to investigate the effectiveness of oseltamivir in patients infected with the pandemic virus in greater depth, and include high-dose studies, assessment of natural and drug-induced resistance, and response to treatment in high-risk populations such as young infants, immunocompromised patients and the severely ill.

Title: Oseltamivir in seasonal influenza: cumulative experience in low- and high-risk patients.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza viruses cause annual disease epidemics that affect individuals at low and high risk for secondary illnesses. Influenza vaccines are widely used in high-risk patients to prevent infection, but the protection afforded varies by population; uptake is also limited in some groups. Antiviral drugs for influenza are now readily available. Oseltamivir is the most widely used antiviral for the treatment and prophylaxis of seasonal influenza, and its efficacy and safety are now well established in a variety of populations. In addition to decreasing the severity and duration of the symptoms of influenza, clinical and epidemiological studies demonstrate that oseltamivir significantly reduces the frequency of secondary illnesses and exacerbation of underlying conditions; survival is also significantly improved in seriously ill patients who are hospitalized with severe influenza. Resistant viruses are isolated with a low frequency during oseltamivir treatment (0.33% in adults and 4.0% in children among almost 2000 oseltamivir-treated patients enrolled onto Roche-sponsored clinical trials of oseltamivir treatment during the oseltamivir development programme). However, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in Europe during the 2007-08 season and circulated in the southern and northern hemispheres in 2008-09. No link with oseltamivir usage could be detected, and the clinical impact of these viruses was limited. Oseltamivir-susceptible pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses now predominate in many countries. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, with a similar adverse event profile to placebo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews clinical experience with oseltamivir in seasonal influenza without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Intercontinental reassortment and genomic variation of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from northern pintails (Anas acuta) in Alaska: examining the evidence through space and time.
Abstract: Migration and population genetic data for northern pintails (Anas acuta) and phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses from this host in Alaska suggest that northern pintails are involved in ongoing intercontinental transmission of avian influenza. Here, we further refine this conclusion through phylogenetic analyses which demonstrate that detection of foreign lineage gene segments is spatially dependent and consistent through time. Our results show detection of foreign lineage gene segments to be most likely at sample locations on the Alaska Peninsula and least likely along the Southern Alaska Coast. Asian lineages detected at four gene segments persisted across years, suggesting maintenance in avian hosts that migrate to Alaska each year from Asia or in hosts that remain in Alaska throughout the year. Alternatively, live viruses may persist in the environment and re-infect birds in subsequent seasons.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic and spatial-temporal analysis of avian influenza viruses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A family of non-classical pseudoknots in influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: A very conserved pseudoknot structure has been shown to fold in influenza virus RNA. The pseudoknot encompasses the 3' splice site of segment 8 RNA in both influenza A and B viruses. By sequence comparison of influenza virus strains, we derive a consensus motif that defines a novel RNA pseudoknot family. The orientation of the coaxially stacked stems in the influenza pseudoknot differs from that in classical H-pseudoknots. Apart from the size of the loops, the topology of the influenza pseudoknot resembles that of some long-range pseudoknotted conformations. A seed alignment of the influenza pseudoknot family, containing representative strain sequences together with a consensus structure description, has been submitted to the RNA families (Rfam) database.
Relevant: False

Title: Avian influenza--a review for doctors in travel medicine.
Abstract: First identified in humans in Hong Kong, influenza A/H5N1, known commonly as avian influenza, has caused human disease in 15 countries around the world. Although the current number of confirmed patients is tiny compared to seasonal and the recently emerged H1N1 'swine' influenza, H5N1 remains a candidate for the next highly pathogenic influenza pandemic. Currently, H5N1 has very limited ability to spread from person-to-person but this may change because of mutation or reassortment with other influenza viruses leading to an influenza pandemic with high mortality. If this occurs travellers are likely to be affected and travel medicine doctors will need to consider avian influenza in returning febrile travellers. The early clinical features may be dismissed easily as 'the flu' resulting in delayed treatment. Treatment options are limited. Oral oseltamivir alone has been the most commonly used drug but mortality remains substantial, up to 80% in Indonesia. Intravenous peramivir has been filed for registration and IV zanamivir is being developed. This review will focus on the epidemiological and clinical features of influenza A/H5N1 avian influenza and will highlight aspects relevant to travel medicine doctors.

Title: Large-scale evolutionary surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus using resequencing arrays.
Abstract: In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus emerged that rapidly spread around the world. While current variants of this virus have caused widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable groups, there remains the possibility that future variants may cause increased virulence, drug resistance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient large-scale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.
Relevant: False

Title: Avian influenza virus monitoring in wintering waterbirds in Iran, 2003-2007.
Abstract: Virological, molecular and serological studies were carried out to determine the status of infections with avian influenza viruses (AIV) in different species of wild waterbirds in Iran during 2003-2007. Samples were collected from 1146 birds representing 45 different species with the majority of samples originating from ducks, coots and shorebirds. Samples originated from 6 different provinces representative for the 15 most important wintering sites of migratory waterbirds in Iran. Overall, AIV were detected in approximately 3.4% of the samples. However, prevalence was higher (up to 8.3%) at selected locations and for certain species. No highly pathogenic avian influenza, including H5N1 was detected. A total of 35 AIVs were detected from cloacal or oropharyngeal swab samples. These positive samples originated mainly from Mallards and Common Teals.Of 711 serum samples tested for AIV antibodies, 345 (48.5%) were positive by using a nucleoprotein-specific competitive ELISA (NP-C-ELISA). Ducks including Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler and Eurasian Wigeon revealed the highest antibody prevalence ranging from 44 to 75%. Results of these investigations provide important information about the prevalence of LPAIV in wild birds in Iran, especially wetlands around the Caspian Sea which represent an important wintering site for migratory water birds. Mallard and Common Teal exhibited the highest number of positives in virological and serological investigations: 43% and 26% virological positive cases and 24% and 46% serological positive reactions, respectively. These two species may play an important role in the ecology and perpetuation of influenza viruses in this region. In addition, it could be shown that both oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of positive birds, and neither should be neglected.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports prevalence and serological data of avian influenza viruses in wild birds without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Research paths to successful prevention and treatment of swine-derived H1N1 influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Despite the fact that the threat of a new influenza pandemic has been hovering over us for quite some time, the truth is that the weapons currently licensed for fighting the swine-derived H1N1 virus are not quite up to the current needs. Although considerable effort has been put into developing new vaccines and antivirals, the available agents are basically the same ones as 10 years ago. In this review, we consider novel prophylactic and therapeutic alternatives, which luckily are being proposed by experts in the field. The better understanding and basic knowledge of influenza viruses, including their high variability and potential for antigenic drift, has prompted the development of new antivirals and more efficacious vaccines that hold promise for the near future.

Title: Full length sequencing of all nine subtypes of the neuraminidase gene of influenza A viruses using subtype specific primer sets.
Abstract: An RT-PCR based method was developed using subtype specific overlapping primers to obtain full length amplification of neuraminidase (NA) gene from all subtypes (N1-N9) of influenza A viruses. This method was validated using reference strains of avian influenza viruses (AIV) (N1-N9), human influenza viruses (N1 and N2), and swine influenza viruses (N1-N3). Amplification of the NA gene was obtained with all viruses tested. Additionally, 200 field isolates of AIV from wild birds were tested by this method and the NA gene was amplified in all isolates. The NA subtype of all 200 isolates was determined by further sequencing of the amplified NA genes and all sequences were submitted to GenBank. The method described in this paper can be used to determine subtype of influenza isolates as well as their evolution and mutations if any, in the NA gene.

Abstract: The emergence and spread of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (2009 H1N1) resulted in extraordinary influenza activity in the United States throughout the summer and fall months of 2009. During this period, influenza activity reached its highest level in the week ending October 24, 2009, with 49 of 50 states reporting geographically widespread disease. As of January 9, 2010, overall influenza activity had declined substantially. Since April 2009, the dominant circulating influenza virus in the United States has been 2009 H1N1. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from August 30, 2009, through January 9, 2010.

Title: Evolutionary dynamics of multiple sublineages of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria from 2006 to 2008.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic A/H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) viruses have seriously affected the Nigerian poultry industry since early 2006. Previous studies have identified multiple introductions of the virus into Nigeria and several reassortment events between cocirculating lineages. To determine the spatial, evolutionary, and population dynamics of the multiple H5N1 lineages cocirculating in Nigeria, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 106 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2008 and representing all 25 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) reporting outbreaks. We identified a major new subclade in Nigeria that is phylogenetically distinguishable from all previously identified sublineages, as well as two novel reassortment events. A detailed analysis of viral phylogeography identified two major source populations for the HPAI H5N1 virus in Nigeria, one in a major commercial poultry area (southwest region) and one in northern Nigeria, where contact between wild birds and backyard poultry is frequent. These findings suggested that migratory birds from Eastern Europe or Russia may serve an important role in the introduction of HPAI H5N1 viruses into Nigeria, although virus spread through the movement of poultry and poultry products cannot be excluded. Our study provides new insight into the genesis and evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria and has important implications for targeting surveillance efforts to rapidly identify the spread of the virus into and within Nigeria.

Title: Activity of isatine-sulfadimidine derivatives against 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in cell culture.
Abstract: The development of antiviral drugs has provided crucial new means to mitigate or relieve the debilitating effects of many viral pathogens. New classes of inhibitors are essential to combat swine influenza viral infection. A series of isatine-sulfadimidine derivatives were screened for antiviral activity against swine influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture. Cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds was also tested in uninfected MDCK cells. All the compounds inhibit the influenza A (H1N1) in MDCK cells. The most active compounds, SPIII-5Br and SPIII-5H, inhibited virus-induced cytopathology by 50% at 27 and 30 microM, respectively, with 50% cytotoxicity occurring at a much higher dose (975-1,000 microM). The positive control compound ribavirin inhibits the replication of the virus at 18 microM and cytotoxic concentration was found to be >1,000 microM. SPIII-5Br and SPIII-5H exhibited potency in the same range as ribavirin and are suitable candidate molecules for further investigation.

Title: Theoretical aspects of immunity.
Abstract: The immune system recognizes a myriad of invading pathogens and their toxic products. It does so with a finite repertoire of antibodies and T cell receptors. We here describe theories that quantify the dynamics of the immune system. We describe how the immune system recognizes antigens by searching the large space of receptor molecules. We consider in some detail the theories that quantify the immune response to influenza and dengue fever. We review theoretical descriptions of the complementary evolution of pathogens that occurs in response to immune system pressure. Methods including bioinformatics, molecular simulation, random energy models, and quantum field theory contribute to a theoretical understanding of aspects of immunity.

Title: Hitchhiking and the population genetic structure of avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Previous studies have revealed a major difference in the phylogenetic structure, extent of genetic diversity, and selection pressure between the surface glycoproteins and internal gene segments of avian influenza viruses (AIV) sampled from wild birds. However, what evolutionary processes are responsible for these strikingly different evolutionary patterns is unclear. To address this issue, we estimated the rate of evolutionary change and time of origin of each segment of AIV sampled globally. Strikingly, the internal segments of the sampled AIV strains possess common ancestors that existed less than 200 years ago. Similarly recent times of origin were observed for each of the individual subtypes within the HA, NA, and NS gene segments. Such a shallow history of genetic diversity suggests an evolutionary model in which the genetic structure of AIV is shaped by a combination of occasional selective sweeps in the HA and NA (and possibly NS) segments, coupled with transient genetic linkage to the internal gene segments.

Title: Potent inhibitors of furin and furin-like proprotein convertases containing decarboxylated P1 arginine mimetics.
Abstract: Furin belongs to the family of proprotein convertases (PCs) and is involved in numerous normal physiological and pathogenic processes, such as viral propagation, bacterial toxin activation, cancer, and metastasis. Furin and related furin-like PCs cleave their substrates at characteristic multibasic consensus sequences, preferentially after an arginine residue. By incorporating decarboxylated arginine mimetics in the P1 position of substrate analogue peptidic inhibitors, we could identify highly potent furin inhibitors. The most potent compound, phenylacetyl-Arg-Val-Arg-4-amidinobenzylamide (15), inhibits furin with a K(i) value of 0.81 nM and has also comparable affinity to other PCs like PC1/3, PACE4, and PC5/6, whereas PC2 and PC7 or trypsin-like serine proteases were poorly affected. In fowl plague virus (influenza A, H7N1)-infected MDCK cells, inhibitor 15 inhibited proteolytic hemagglutinin cleavage and was able to reduce virus propagation in a long-term infection test. Molecular modeling revealed several key interactions of the 4-amidinobenzylamide residue in the S1 pocket of furin contributing to the excellent affinity of these inhibitors.

Title: Evaluation of the efficacy and cross-protectivity of recent human and swine vaccines against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.
Abstract: The current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus remains transmissible among humans worldwide with cases of reverse zoonosis, providing opportunities to produce more pathogenic variants which could pose greater human health concerns. To investigate whether recent seasonal human or swine H1N1 vaccines could induce cross-reactive immune responses against infection with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, mice, ferrets or mini-pigs were administered with various regimens (once or twice) and antigen content (1.77, 3.5 or 7.5 microg HA) of a-Brsibane/59/07, a-CAN01/04 or RgCA/04/09xPR8 vaccine. Receipt of a-CAN01/04 (2-doses) but not a-Brisbane/59/07 induced detectable but modest (20-40 units) cross-reactive serum antibody against CA/04/09 by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays in mice. Only double administration (7.5 microg HA) of both vaccine in ferrets could elicit cross-reactivity (30-60 HI titers). Similar antigen content of a-CAN01/04 in mini-pigs also caused a modest approximately 30 HI titers (twice vaccinated). However, vaccine-induced antibody titers could not suppress active virus replication in the lungs (mice) or virus shedding (ferrets and pigs) of immunized hosts intranasally challenged with CA/04/09. Furthermore, neither ferrets nor swine could abrogate aerosol transmission of the virus into naïve contact animals. Altogether, these results suggest that neither recent human nor animal H1N1 vaccine could provide complete protectivity in all animal models. Thus, this study warrants the need for strain-specific vaccines that could yield the optimal protection desired for humans and/or animals.

Title: Broad-spectrum and virus-specific nucleic acid-based antivirals against influenza.
Abstract: Rapid increase in drug-resistant influenza virus isolates, and pandemic threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A and swine flu viruses provide clear and compelling reasons for fast tracking development of novel antiviral drugs. Nucleic acid-based drugs represent a promising class of novel antiviral agents that can be designed to target various seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza viruses. Nucleic acids can be designed to elicit broad-spectrum antiviral responses in the host, by suppressing viral gene expression, or by inducing cleavage or degradation of viral RNA. Immunomodulating nucleic acids, such as double stranded RNA and CpG oligonucleotides, can be potent anti-influenza agents that work by eliciting protective innate and adaptive immunity in the host. By activating the toll-like receptor signaling pathways, these drugs can activate the host's antiviral and inflammatory defenses to combat influenza viruses. Antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs (siRNA), and nanoRNAs represent sequence specific gene-silencing approaches that could be deployed to suppress or inhibit viral protein gene expression. Lastly, catalytic nucleic acids such as DNAzymes and/or ribozymes can suppress viral replication by repeatedly cleaving viral mRNAs and template RNAs. In summary, nucleic acid-based antiviral agents are versatile, diverse and could complement existing antiviral drugs in combating influenza.

Title: Occurrence of a pig respiratory disease associated with swine influenza A (H1N2) virus in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan.
Abstract: In February 2008, a feeder pig herd of the affected farm in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, showed increasing respiratory symptoms; by April, the situation worsened with 12-16 pigs dying daily. Diagnostic tests revealed the presence of H1N2 subtype of swine influenza virus (SIV) and Pasteurella multocida from nasal swab and lung emulsion. Serological tests by hemagglutination inhibition method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (ELISA; imported from U.S.A.) indicated the spread of SIV into the pig herds of the affected farm around April 2008. The severe infection and subsequent damage were considered as a result of the combined infection of SIV (H1N2) and bacteria that may have been prevalent in the pig farm. Genetic homology search of sequences for the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of A/swine/Tochigi/1/08 showed high homology to Japanese SIVs (H1N2) isolated in the 2000s. Therefore, we considered that Japanese SIV (H1N2) has established an independent stable lineage and participated in infecting pig populations as one of the factors of the pig respiratory disease complex. Consistent surveillance would contribute to clarifying the prevalence of dominant SIVs.

Title: Safety, immunogencity, and efficacy of a cold-adapted A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) vaccine in mice and ferrets.
Abstract: We studied the attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the cold-adapted A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA ca) (H2N2) virus in mice and ferrets to evaluate its use in the event of an H2 influenza pandemic. The AA ca virus was restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets. In mice, 2 doses of vaccine elicited a >4-fold rise in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titer and resulted in complete inhibition of viral replication following lethal homologous wild-type virus challenge. In ferrets, a single dose of the vaccine elicited a >4-fold rise in HAI titer and conferred complete protection against homologous wild-type virus challenge in the upper respiratory tract. In both mice and ferrets, the AA ca virus provided significant protection from challenge with heterologous H2 virus challenge in the respiratory tract. The AA ca vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and efficacious against homologous and heterologous challenge in mice and ferrets, supporting the evaluation of this vaccine in clinical trials.

Title: Development of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of avian influenza viruses in field specimens.
Abstract: Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an established gene amplification method for rapid diagnosis of various infectious diseases. In order to detect avian influenza viruses, particularly in field specimens, specific primers targeting the matrix gene were designed. Thirty-four virus samples, including isolates from wild and domestic avian hosts belonging to various geographical areas, were used to confirm the validity of the primers. All samples were confirmed to be positive in less than 1 hr. The RT-LAMP assay was also able to detect avian influenza virus in the various field samples, such as swabs, tissues, and feces. These results indicate that the developed RT-LAMP assay with uniquely designed primers is potentially useful in comprehensive avian influenza surveillance.

Title: Influenza A: understanding the viral life cycle.
Abstract: Influenza A virus belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviridae. It is an enveloped virus with a negative sense RNA segmented genome that encodes for 11 viral genes. This virus has evolved a number of mechanisms that enable it to invade host cells and subvert the host cell machinery for its own purpose, that is, for the sole production of more virus. Two of the mechanisms that the virus uses are "cap-snatching" and preventing the host cell from expressing its own genes. This mini-review provides a brief overview as to how the virus is able to invade host cells, replicate itself, and exit the host cell.

Title: Human host factors required for influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is an RNA virus that encodes up to 11 proteins and this small coding capacity demands that the virus use the host cellular machinery for many aspects of its life cycle. Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only informs us of the molecular pathways exploited by the virus but also provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Here we use an integrative systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signalling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched, and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to be required for efficient wild-type influenza virus growth, and further analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors necessary for viral entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and COPI-protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta. Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) IIbeta (CAMK2B). Notably, growth of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and we show that small molecule inhibitors of several factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus replication.
Relevant: False

Title: The effect of age on the pathogenesis of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected experimentally.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have recently displayed increased virulence for wild waterfowl. To study the effect of host age on the shedding and tissue dissemination of a HPAI H5N1 virus in infected Pekin ducks. Pekin ducks in two age-matched groups (n = 18), 8 and 12 weeks old (wo) were each infected with 10(6) EID(50)/0.1 ml of HPAI A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1, clade 2.2). Each day for 5 days, birds were monitored clinically, and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs collected, before three birds from each group were selected randomly for post-mortem examination. Tissue samples were collected for examination by real-time RT-PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Severe clinical signs, including incoordination and torticollis were observed in the 8 wo group resulting in 100% mortality by 4 dpi. Mild clinical signs were observed in the 12 wo group with no mortality. Real-time RT-PCR and IHC results demonstrated the systemic spread of H5N1 virus in birds of both age groups. Higher levels of virus shedding were detected in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs, with similar levels of shedding detected in both age groups. Variations in level and temporal dissemination of virus within tissues of older ducks, and the presence of the virus in brain and heart were observed, which coincided with the appearance of clinical signs preceding death in younger birds. These results are consistent with reports of natural infections of wild waterfowl and poultry possibly indicating an age-related association with dissemination and clinical outcome in ducks following infection with H5N1 HPAI virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the effect of host age on pathogenesis and virus dissemination in ducks infected with a specific H5N1 virus strain, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Aurintricarboxylic acid is a potent inhibitor of influenza A and B virus neuraminidases.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause serious infections that can be prevented or treated using vaccines or antiviral agents, respectively. While vaccines are effective, they have a number of limitations, and influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. This necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. We investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. We found, by neutral red assay, that ATA was protective, and by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, confirmed that ATA reduced viral replication and release. Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral effects of aurintricarboxylic acid on influenza viruses and neuraminidase activity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Passive immunity to pandemic H1N1 2009 by swine flu parties.
Abstract: The general population is concerned about the probable devastating effects of pandemic H1N1 2009. Based upon the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, scientific publications and theories, the idea of swine flu parties to achieve passive immunity against pandemic H1N1 2009 has been proposed. Public health officials have asked the general public not to resort to this method. However, no concrete evidence of the reasoning behind the recommendation has been given. In this paper, we have dynamically modeled the effect of swine flu parties on the immunity achieved and associated mortality for a period of two years. The simulations show that the public should not organize or participate in swine flu parties as they will likely increase swine flu-associated mortality.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study on public health strategies and immunity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Prolonged shedding of influenza A(H1N1)v virus: two case reports from France 2009.
Abstract: We observed a prolonged shedding of virus 14 and 28 days after symptom onset in two patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza, who did not have immunodepression and were treated with neuraminidase inhibitor. This prolonged shedding was not associated with the emergence of resistance mutation H275Y in the viral neuraminidase gene.

Title: X-ray structures of NS1 effector domain mutants.
Abstract: The influenza A virus nonstructural protein NS1 is a multifunctional dimeric protein that acts as a potent inhibitor of the host cellular antiviral state. The C-terminal effector domain of NS1 binds host proteins, including CPSF30, and is a target for the development of new antiviral drugs. Here we present crystallographic structures of two mutant effector domains, W187Y and W187A, of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus. Unlike wild-type, the mutants behave exclusively as monomers in solution based on gel filtration data and light scattering. The W187Y mutant is able to bind CPSF30 with a binding affinity close to the wild-type protein; that is, it retains a receptor site for aromatic ligands nearly identical to the wild-type. Therefore, this monomeric mutant protein could serve as a drug target for a high throughput inhibitor screening assays, since its binding pocket is unoccupied in solution and potentially more accessible to small molecule ligands.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a structural study of NS1 mutants without explicit links to viral phenotypes.

Title: Genome packaging in influenza A virus.
Abstract: The negative-sense RNA genome of influenza A virus is composed of eight segments, which encode 12 proteins between them. At the final stage of viral assembly, these genomic virion (v)RNAs are incorporated into the virion as it buds from the apical plasma membrane of the cell. Genome segmentation confers evolutionary advantages on the virus, but also poses a problem during virion assembly as at least one copy of each of the eight segments is required to produce a fully infectious virus particle. Historically, arguments have been presented in favour of a specific packaging mechanism that ensures incorporation of a full genome complement, as well as for an alternative model in which segments are chosen at random but packaged in sufficient numbers to ensure that a reasonable proportion of virions are viable. The question has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years leading to a consensus that the vast majority of virions contain no more than eight segments and that a specific mechanism does indeed function to select one copy of each vRNA. This review summarizes work leading to this conclusion. In addition, we describe recent progress in identifying the specific packaging signals and discuss likely mechanisms by which these RNA elements might operate.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on genome packaging mechanisms without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Post-exposure prophylaxis during pandemic outbreaks.
Abstract: With the rise of the second pandemic wave of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in the current season in the Northern Hemisphere, pandemic plans are being carefully re-evaluated, particularly for the strategic use of antiviral drugs. The recent emergence of oseltamivir-resistant in treated H1N1 patients has raised concerns about the prudent use of neuraminidase inhibitors for both treatment of ill individuals and post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts. We extended an established population dynamical model of pandemic influenza with treatment to include post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts. Using parameter estimates published in the literature, we simulated the model to evaluate the combined effect of treatment and prophylaxis in minimizing morbidity and mortality of pandemic infections in the context of transmissible drug resistance. We demonstrated that, when transmissible resistant strains are present, post-exposure prophylaxis can promote the spread of resistance, especially when combined with aggressive treatment. For a given treatment level, there is an optimal coverage of prophylaxis that minimizes the total number of infections (final size) and this coverage decreases as a higher proportion of infected individuals are treated. We found that, when treatment is maintained at intermediate levels, limited post-exposure prophylaxis provides an optimal strategy for reducing the final size of the pandemic while minimizing the total number of deaths. We tested our results by performing a sensitivity analysis over a range of key model parameters and observed that the incidence of infection depends strongly on the transmission fitness of resistant strains. Our findings suggest that, in the presence of transmissible drug resistance, strategies that prioritize the treatment of only ill individuals, rather than the prophylaxis of those suspected of being exposed, are most effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic. The impact of post-exposure prophylaxis depends critically on the treatment level and the transmissibility of resistant strains and, therefore, enhanced surveillance and clinical monitoring for resistant mutants constitutes a key component of any comprehensive plan for antiviral drug use during an influenza pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study on antiviral drug use and resistance spread, not linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: From where did the 2009 'swine-origin' influenza A virus (H1N1) emerge?
Abstract: The swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus that appeared in 2009 and was first found in human beings in Mexico, is a reassortant with at least three parents. Six of the genes are closest in sequence to those of H1N2 'triple-reassortant' influenza viruses isolated from pigs in North America around 1999-2000. Its other two genes are from different Eurasian 'avian-like' viruses of pigs; the NA gene is closest to H1N1 viruses isolated in Europe in 1991-1993, and the MP gene is closest to H3N2 viruses isolated in Asia in 1999-2000. The sequences of these genes do not directly reveal the immediate source of the virus as the closest were from isolates collected more than a decade before the human pandemic started. The three parents of the virus may have been assembled in one place by natural means, such as by migrating birds, however the consistent link with pig viruses suggests that human activity was involved. We discuss a published suggestion that unsampled pig herds, the intercontinental live pig trade, together with porous quarantine barriers, generated the reassortant. We contrast that suggestion with the possibility that laboratory errors involving the sharing of virus isolates and cultured cells, or perhaps vaccine production, may have been involved. Gene sequences from isolates that bridge the time and phylogenetic gap between the new virus and its parents will distinguish between these possibilities, and we suggest where they should be sought. It is important that the source of the new virus be found if we wish to avoid future pandemics rather than just trying to minimize the consequences after they have emerged. Influenza virus is a very significant zoonotic pathogen. Public confidence in influenza research, and the agribusinesses that are based on influenza's many hosts, has been eroded by several recent events involving the virus. Measures that might restore confidence include establishing a unified international administrative framework coordinating surveillance, research and commercial work with this virus, and maintaining a registry of all influenza isolates.

Abstract: Viruses show ultrastructural changes during viral assembly and budding processes in which viral genome and proteins are systemically assembled. Electron microscopy is the only way that enables us to observe such ultrastructural changes. We have investigated the mechanisms of Ebola and influenza virion formation by electron microscopy. We have elucidated the roles of each Ebola virus protein in viral assembly and budding as well as the mechanisms of genome packaging of influenza A viruses.

Title: [Highly pathogenic avian influenza and wild birds].
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 prevails worldwide and causes serious problems in poultry industry. The virus is also known as one of the most important zoonotic agents derived from avian species. Because many bird species other than poultry such as chicken and duck are susceptible for HPAIV infection, wild birds are thought to play an important role in distribution and transmission of the virus. However, the ecological role of wild birds as a reservoir of HPAIV in nature has not been completely understood. To define the ecological role of wild birds in distribution of HPAIV, extensive surveillance in wild birds including migratory and resident birds in Japan was conducted. Until now, 3 strains of H5N1 subtype have been isolated. One was isolated from mountain hawk-eagle (Spizaetus nipalensis) which was found sick at Sagara village, Kumamoto prefecture, Japan on January 2007 and ultimately died after a short while. The other two strains were isolated from whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) which were found at Lake Towada in Aomori prefecture in April and May 2008, respectively. Because the wild birds migrate on a global scale, similar problems could be always happened in any other countries. Consequently, comprehensive surveillance in wild birds with international cooperation is required for efficient global control of HPAI.

Reason: The paper discusses ecological surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, August 30-October 31, 2009.
Abstract: The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in the United States in April 2009 and has since spread worldwide. Influenza activity resulting from this virus occurred throughout the summer and, by late August, activity had begun to increase in the southeastern United States. Since August, activity has increased in all regions of the United States. As of the week ending October 31, nearly all states were reporting widespread disease. Since April 2009, pandemic H1N1 has remained the dominant circulating influenza strain. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from August 30, 2009, defined as the beginning of the 2009-10 influenza season, through October 31, 2009.

Title: Nuclear import and assembly of influenza A virus RNA polymerase studied in live cells by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy.
Abstract: Intracellular transport and assembly of the subunits of the heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase constitute a key component of the replication cycle of influenza virus. Recent results suggest that efficient polymerase assembly is a limiting factor in the viability of reassortant viruses. The mechanism of nuclear import and assembly of the three polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2, and PA, is still controversial, yet it is clearly of great significance in understanding the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential. In this study, we systematically investigated the interactions between the polymerase subunits and their localization in living cells by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and quantitative confocal microscopy. We could show that PB1 and PA form a dimer in the cytoplasm, which is imported into the nucleus separately from PB2. Once in the nucleus, the PB1/PA dimer associates with PB2 to form the trimeric polymerase. Photon-counting histogram analysis revealed that trimeric polymerase complexes can form higher-order oligomers in the nucleus. We furthermore demonstrate that impairing the nuclear import of PB2 by mutating its nuclear localization signal leads to abnormal formation of the trimeric polymerase in the cytoplasm. Taken together, our results demonstrate which of the previously discussed influenza virus polymerase transport models operates in live cells. Our study sheds light on the interplay between the nuclear import of the subunits and the assembly of the influenza virus polymerase and provides a methodological framework to analyze the effects of different host range mutations in the future.

Title: Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in chicken lung and trachea with avian influenza virus infection by a deep sequencing approach.
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in a wide spectrum of biological processes and have been shown to be important effectors in the intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Avian influenza virus (AIV) not only causes significant economic losses in poultry production, but also is of great concern to human health. The objective of this study was to identify miRNAs associated with AIV infections in chickens. Total RNAs were isolated from lung and trachea of low pathogenic H5N3 infected and non-infected SPF chickens at 4 days post-infection. A total of 278,398 and 340,726 reads were obtained from lung and trachea, respectively. And 377 miRNAs were detected in lungs and 149 in tracheae from a total of 474 distinct chicken miRNAs available at the miRBase, respectively. Seventy-three and thirty-six miRNAs were differentially expressed between infected and non-infected chickens in lungs and tracheae, respectively. There were more miRNAs highly expressed in non-infected tissues than in infected tissues. Interestingly, some of these differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-146, have been previously reported to be associated with immune-related signal pathways in mammals. To our knowledge, this is the first study on miRNA gene expression in AIV infected chickens using a deep sequencing approach. During AIV infection, many host miRNAs were differentially regulated, supporting the hypothesis that certain miRNAs might be essential in the host-pathogen interactions. Elucidation of the mechanism of these miRNAs on the regulation of host-AIV interaction will lead to the development of new control strategies to prevent or treat AIV infections in poultry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host miRNAs differentially expressed upon avian influenza virus infection, focusing on host response rather than explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Protective memory responses are modulated by priming events prior to challenge.
Abstract: Human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A viruses in the last decade have legitimized fears of a long-predicted pandemic. We thus investigated the response to secondary infections with an engineered, but still highly virulent, H5N1 influenza A virus in the C57BL/6 mouse model. Mice primed with the H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus were partially protected from lethality following respiratory infection with the modified H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (DeltaVn1203). In contrast, those that had been comparably exposed to the HKx31 (H3N2) virus succumbed to the DeltaVn1203 challenge, despite similarities in viral replication, weight loss, and secondary CD8(+)-T-cell response characteristics. All three viruses share the internal genes of PR8 that are known to stimulate protective CD8(+)-T-cell-mediated immunity. This differential survival of PR8- and HKx31-primed mice was also apparent for antibody-deficient mice challenged with the DeltaVn1203 virus. The relative protection afforded by PR8 priming was abrogated in tumor necrosis factor-deficient (TNF(-/-)) mice, although lung fluids from the B6 HKx31-primed mice contained more TNF early after challenge. These data demonstrate that the nature of the primary infection can influence pathological outcomes following virulent influenza virus challenge, although the effect is not clearly correlated with classical measures of CD8(+)-T-cell-mediated immunity.

Reason: The paper investigates immune memory responses modulated by priming events without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Mechanisms and functional implications of the degradation of host RNA polymerase II in influenza virus infected cells.
Abstract: Influenza viruses induce a host shut off mechanism leading to the general inhibition of host gene expression in infected cells. Here, we report that the large subunit of host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is degraded in infected cells and propose that this degradation is mediated by the viral RNA polymerase that associates with Pol II. We detect increased ubiquitylation of Pol II in infected cells and upon the expression of the viral RNA polymerase suggesting that the proteasome pathway plays a role in Pol II degradation. Furthermore, we find that expression of the viral RNA polymerase results in the inhibition of Pol II transcription. We propose that Pol II inhibition and degradation in influenza virus infected cells could represent a viral strategy to evade host antiviral defense mechanisms. Our results also suggest a mechanism for the temporal regulation of viral mRNA synthesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host RNA polymerase II degradation mechanisms in infected cells, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionary fingerprinting of genes.
Abstract: Over time, natural selection molds every gene into a unique mosaic of sites evolving rapidly or resisting change-an "evolutionary fingerprint" of the gene. Aspects of this evolutionary fingerprint, such as the site-specific ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS), are commonly used to identify genetic features of potential biological interest; however, no framework exists for comparing evolutionary fingerprints between genes. We hypothesize that protein-coding genes with similar protein structure and/or function tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints and that comparing evolutionary fingerprints can be useful for discovering similarities between genes in a way that is analogous to, but independent of, discovery of similarity via sequence-based comparison tools such as Blast. To test this hypothesis, we develop a novel model of coding sequence evolution that uses a general bivariate discrete parameterization of the evolutionary rates. We show that this approach provides a better fit to the data using a smaller number of parameters than existing models. Next, we use the model to represent evolutionary fingerprints as probability distributions and present a methodology for comparing these distributions in a way that is robust against variations in data set size and divergence. Finally, using sequences of three rapidly evolving RNA viruses (HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A virus), we demonstrate that genes within the same functional group tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints. Our framework provides a sound statistical foundation for efficient inference and comparison of evolutionary rate patterns in arbitrary collections of gene alignments, clustering homologous and nonhomologous genes, and investigation of biological and functional correlates of evolutionary rates.

Reason: The paper develops a novel model for evolutionary fingerprinting of genes and compares evolutionary rate patterns, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: The comparative genomics of viral emergence.
Abstract: RNA viruses are the main agents of emerging and re-emerging diseases. It is therefore important to reveal the evolutionary processes that underpin their ability to jump species boundaries and establish themselves in new hosts. Here, I discuss how comparative genomics can contribute to this endeavor. Arguably the most important evolutionary process in RNA virus evolution, abundant mutation, may even open up avenues for their control through "lethal mutagenesis." Despite this remarkable mutational power, adaptation to diverse host species remains a major adaptive challenge, such that the most common outcome of host jumps are short-term "spillover" infections. A powerful case study of the utility of genomic approaches to studies of viral evolution and emergence is provided by influenza virus and brought into sharp focus by the ongoing epidemic of swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus (A/H1N1pdm). Research here reveals a marked lack of surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs, coupled with the possibility of cryptic transmission before the first reported human cases, such that the exact genesis of A/H1N1pdm (where, when, how) is uncertain.

Title: Evaluation of a rapid molecular algorithm for detection of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus and screening for a key oseltamivir resistance (H275Y) substitution in neuraminidase.
Abstract: Rapid and specific molecular tests for identification of the recently identified pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus as well as rapid molecular tests to identify antiviral resistant strains are urgently needed. We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8). No oseltamivir resistance was detected. We present a sensitive and specific approach for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and a rapid RT-PCR assay detecting a primary oseltamivir resistance mutation which can be incorporated easily into clinical virology algorithms.

Title: Changes in prescribing of antiviral medications for influenza associated with new treatment guidelines.
Abstract: In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended discontinuing the use of adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) to treat influenza because of high levels of resistance to this class of antivirals. We examined changes in prescribing practices resulting from this recommendation and found that prescribing of adamantanes declined nationwide, with these drugs accounting for approximately 40% of the antivirals prescribed for influenza from 2000 to 2005 and only 2% in 2006. This finding provides evidence of a rapid change in clinical practice associated with the dissemination of treatment guidelines. Evaluating the effectiveness with which public health recommendations are translated into practice is important given the ongoing emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs and a novel H1N1 influenza virus.

Title: Bayesian phylogeography finds its roots.
Abstract: As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper introduces a Bayesian phylogeographic framework for viral dispersal inference, focusing on spatial and temporal dynamics rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The feasibility of using high resolution genome sequencing of influenza A viruses to detect mixed infections and quasispecies.
Abstract: The rapidly expanding availability of de novo sequencing technologies can greatly facilitate efforts to monitor the relatively high mutation rates of influenza A viruses and the detection of quasispecies. Both the mutation rates and the lineages of influenza A viruses are likely to play an important role in the natural history of these viruses and the emergence of phenotypically and antigenically distinct strains. We evaluated quasispecies and mixed infections by de novo sequencing the whole genomes of 10 virus isolates, including eight avian influenza viruses grown in embryonated chicken eggs (six waterfowl isolates - five H3N2 and one H4N6; an H7N3 turkey isolate; and a bald eagle isolate with H1N1/H2N1 mixed infection), and two tissue cultured H3N2 swine influenza viruses. Two waterfowl cloacal swabs were included in the analysis. Full-length sequences of all segments were obtained with 20 to 787-X coverage for the ten viruses and one cloacal swab. The second cloacal swab yielded 15 influenza reads of approximately 230 bases, sufficient for bioinformatic inference of mixed infections or quasispecies. Genomic subpopulations or quasispecies of viruses were identified in four egg grown avian influenza isolates and one cell cultured swine virus. A bald eagle isolate and the second cloacal swab showed evidence of mixed infections with two (H1 and H2) and three (H1, H3, and H4) HA subtypes, respectively. Multiple sequence differences were identified between cloacal swab and the virus recovered using embryonated chicken eggs. We describe a new approach to comprehensively identify mixed infections and quasispecies in low passage influenza A isolates and cloacal swabs and add to the understanding of the ecology of influenza A virus populations.

Title: Intensive care adult patients with severe respiratory failure caused by Influenza A (H1N1)v in Spain.
Abstract: Patients with influenza A (H1N1)v infection have developed rapidly progressive lower respiratory tract disease resulting in respiratory failure. We describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of the first 32 persons reported to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to influenza A (H1N1)v infection in Spain. We used medical chart reviews to collect data on ICU adult patients reported in a standardized form. Influenza A (H1N1)v infection was confirmed in specimens using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT PCR) assay. Illness onset of the 32 patients occurred between 23 June and 31 July, 2009. The median age was 36 years (IQR = 31 - 52). Ten (31.2%) were obese, 2 (6.3%) pregnant and 16 (50%) had pre-existing medical complications. Twenty-nine (90.6%) had primary viral pneumonitis, 2 (6.3%) exacerbation of structural respiratory disease and 1 (3.1%) secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty-four patients (75.0%) developed multiorgan dysfunction, 7 (21.9%) received renal replacement techniques and 24 (75.0%) required mechanical ventilation. Six patients died within 28 days, with two additional late deaths. Oseltamivir administration delay ranged from 2 to 8 days after illness onset, 31.2% received high-dose (300 mg/day), and treatment duration ranged from 5 to 10 days (mean 8.0 +/- 3.3). Over a 5-week period, influenza A (H1N1)v infection led to ICU admission in 32 adult patients, with frequently observed severe hypoxemia and a relatively high case-fatality rate.

Title: Nuclear dynamics of influenza A virus ribonucleoproteins revealed by live-cell imaging studies.
Abstract: The negative sense RNA genome of influenza A virus is transcribed and replicated in the nuclei of infected cells by the viral RNA polymerase. Only four viral polypeptides are required but multiple cellular components are potentially involved. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterise the dynamics of GFP-tagged viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components in living cells. The nucleoprotein (NP) displayed very slow mobility that significantly increased on formation of transcriptionally active RNPs. Conversely, single or dimeric polymerase subunits showed fast nuclear dynamics that decreased upon formation of heterotrimers, suggesting increased interaction of the full polymerase complex with a relatively immobile cellular component(s). Treatment with inhibitors of cellular transcription indicated that in part, this reflected an interaction with cellular RNA polymerase II. Analysis of mutated influenza virus polymerase complexes further suggested that this was through an interaction between PB2 and RNA Pol II separate from PB2 cap-binding activity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes nuclear dynamics of viral ribonucleoproteins but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The survey of H5N1 flu virus in wild birds in 14 Provinces of China from 2004 to 2007.
Abstract: The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza emerged in the year 1996 in Asia, and has spread to Europe and Africa recently. At present, effective monitoring and data analysis of H5N1 are not sufficient in Chinese mainland. During the period from April of 2004 to August of 2007, we collected 14,472 wild bird samples covering 56 species of 10 orders in 14 provinces of China and monitored the prevalence of flu virus based on RT-PCR specific for H5N1 subtype. The 149 positive samples involved six orders. Anseriformes had the highest prevalence while Passeriformes had the lowest prevalence (2.70% versus 0.36%). Among the 24 positive species, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) had the highest prevalence (4.37%). A difference of prevalence was found among 14 provinces. Qinghai had a higher prevalence than the other 13 provinces combined (3.88% versus 0.43%). The prevalence in three species in Qinghai province (Pintail (Anas acuta), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula)) were obviously higher than those in other 13 provinces. The results of sequence analysis indicated that the 17 strains isolated from wild birds were distributed in five clades (2.3.1, 2.2, 2.5, 6, and 7), which suggested that genetic diversity existed among H5N1 viruses isolated from wild birds. The five isolates from Qinghai came from one clade (2.2) and had a short evolutionary distance with the isolates obtained from Qinghai in the year 2005. We have measured the prevalence of H5N1 virus in 56 species of wild birds in 14 provinces of China. Continuous monitoring in the field should be carried out to know whether H5N1 virus can be maintained by wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study surveys prevalence and genetic diversity of H5N1 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Panorama phylogenetic diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal gene sequences.
Abstract: Type A influenza viruses are important pathogens of humans, birds, pigs, horses and some marine mammals. The viruses have evolved into multiple complicated subtypes, lineages and sublineages. Recently, the phylogenetic diversity of type A influenza viruses from a whole view has been described based on the viral external HA and NA gene sequences, but remains unclear in terms of their six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS). In this report, 2798 representative sequences of the six viral internal genes were selected from GenBank using the web servers in NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. Then, the phylogenetic relationships among the representative sequences were calculated using the software tools MEGA 4.1 and RAxML 7.0.4. Lineages and sublineages were classified mainly according to topology of the phylogenetic trees and distribution of the viruses in hosts, regions and time. The panorama phylogenetic trees of the six internal genes of type A influenza viruses were constructed. Lineages and sublineages within the type based on the six internal genes were classified and designated by a tentative universal numerical nomenclature system. The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different regions, periods, and hosts based on the panorama trees was analyzed. This study presents the first whole views to the phylogenetic diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal genes. It also proposes a tentative universal nomenclature system for the viral lineages and sublineages. These can be a candidate framework to generalize the history and explore the future of the viruses, and will facilitate future scientific communications on the phylogenetic diversity and evolution of the viruses. In addition, it provides a novel phylogenetic view (i.e. the whole view) to recognize the viruses including the origin of the pandemic A(H1N1) influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a phylogenetic diversity and classification study of influenza internal genes without explicit links between genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: RNA virus genomics: a world of possibilities.
Abstract: The increasing availability of complete genome sequences of RNA viruses has the potential to shed new light on fundamental aspects of their biology. Here, I use case studies of 3 RNA viruses to explore the impact of genomic sequence data, with particular emphasis on influenza A virus. Notably, the studies of RNA virus genomics undertaken to date largely focused on issues of evolution and epidemiology, and they have given these disciplines new impetus. However, genomic data have so far made fewer inroads into areas of more direct importance for disease, prevention, and control; thus, harnessing their full potential remains an important goal.

Title: Strong interferon-inducing capacity of a highly virulent variant of influenza A virus strain PR8 with deletions in the NS1 gene.
Abstract: Influenza viruses lacking the interferon (IFN)-antagonistic non-structural NS1 protein are strongly attenuated. Here, we show that mutants of a highly virulent variant of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) carrying either a complete deletion or C-terminal truncations of NS1 were far more potent inducers of IFN in infected mice than NS1 mutants derived from standard A/PR/8/34. Efficient induction of IFN correlated with successful initial virus replication in mouse lungs, indicating that the IFN response is boosted by enhanced viral activity. As the new NS1 mutants can be handled in standard biosafety laboratories, they represent convenient novel tools for studying virus-induced IFN expression in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on interferon induction by NS1 mutants but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond IFN induction.

Title: Influenza in long-term care facilities: preventable, detectable, treatable.
Abstract: Influenza in long-term care facilities is an ever more challenging problem. Vaccination of residents and health care workers is the most important preventive measure. Although vaccine efficacy has been questioned, the preponderance of data favors vaccination. Antiviral resistance complicates postexposure chemoprophylaxis and treatment. Factors that limit the choice of antiviral agents in this patient population include limited vaccine supplies and impaired dexterity and confusion in long-term care residents.

Title: Early epidemiological assessment of the virulence of emerging infectious diseases: a case study of an influenza pandemic.
Abstract: The case fatality ratio (CFR), the ratio of deaths from an infectious disease to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence. Calculation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases during the course of an epidemic tends to result in a biased CFR. The present study develops a simple method to obtain an unbiased estimate of confirmed CFR (cCFR), using only the confirmed cases as the denominator, at an early stage of epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths. Our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. We first examine the approach by analyzing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) with known unbiased cCFR estimate, and then investigate published epidemiological datasets of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the USA and Canada (2009). Because observation of a few deaths alone does not permit estimating the distribution of the time from onset to death, the uncertainty is addressed by means of sensitivity analysis. The maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased cCFR for influenza may lie in the range of 0.16-4.48% within the assumed parameter space for a factor of underestimation. The estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. Even when there have been no deaths, our model permits estimating a conservative upper bound of the cCFR. Although one has to keep in mind that the cCFR for an entire population is vulnerable to its variations among sub-populations and underdiagnosis, our method is useful for assessing virulence at the early stage of an epidemic and for informing policy makers and the public.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an epidemiological modeling study estimating virulence (CFR) without direct viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Context-specific target definition in influenza a virus hemagglutinin-glycan receptor interactions.
Abstract: Protein-glycan interactions are important regulators of a variety of biological processes, ranging from immune recognition to anticoagulation. An important area of active research is directed toward understanding the role of host cell surface glycans as recognition sites for pathogen protein receptors. Recognition of cell surface glycans is a widely employed strategy for a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses. We present here a representative example of such an interaction: the binding of influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) to specific sialylated glycans on the cell surface of human upper airway epithelial cells, which initiates the infection cycle. We detail a generalizable strategy to understand the nature of protein-glycan interactions both structurally and biochemically, using HA as a model system. This strategy combines a top-down approach using available structural information to define important contacts between glycans and HA, with a bottom-up approach using data-mining and informatics approaches to identify the common motifs that distinguish glycan binders from nonbinders. By probing protein-glycan interactions simultaneously through top-down and bottom-up approaches, we can scientifically validate a series of observations. This in turn provides additional confidence and surmounts known challenges in the study of protein-glycan interactions, such as accounting for multivalency, and thus truly defines concepts such as specificity, affinity, and avidity. With the advent of new technologies for glycomics-including glycan arrays, data-mining solutions, and robust algorithms to model protein-glycan interactions-we anticipate that such combination approaches will become tractable for a wide variety of protein-glycan interactions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a strategy to study protein-glycan interactions but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular evolution of novel swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza viruses among and before human.
Abstract: We find that the novel A/H1N1 influenza viruses exhibit very low genetic divergence and suffer strong purifying selection among human population and confirm that they originated from the reassortment of previous triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses including genomic segments from both avian and human lineages with North American and Eurasian swine lineages. The longer phylogenetic branch length to their nearest genetic neighbors indicates that the origin of the novel A/H1N1 is unlikely to be a very recent event. Seventy-six new unique mutations are found to be monomorphically fixed in the novel A/H1N1 virus lineages, suggesting a role of selective sweep in the early evolution of this virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on molecular evolution and genetic divergence of swine-origin H1N1 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolution and emergence of novel human infections.
Abstract: Some zoonotic pathogens cause sporadic infection in humans but rarely propagate further, while others have succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and becoming established in the human population. Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability. Finally, we present a simple method for monitoring outbreaks for signs of emergence and discuss public health implications.
Relevant: False

Title: What will the next influenza season bring about: seasonal influenza or the new A(H1N1)v? An analysis of German influenza surveillance data.
Abstract: For the next influenza season (winter 2009-10) the relative contributions to virus circulation and influenza-associated morbidity of the seasonal influenza viruses A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and B, and the new influenza A(H1N1)v are still unknown. We estimated the chances of seasonal influenza to circulate during the upcoming season using data of the German influenza sentinel scheme from 1992 to 2009. We calculated type and subtype-specific indices for past exposure and the corresponding morbidity indices for each season. For the upcoming season 2009-10 our model suggests that it is unlikely that influenza A(H3N2) will circulate with more than a low intensity, seasonal A(H1N1) with more than a low to moderate intensity, and influenza B with more than a low to median intensity. The probability of a competitive circulation of seasonal influenza A with the new A(H1N1)v is low, increasing the chance for the latter to dominate the next influenza season in Germany.

Title: Influenza a virus induced apoptosis: inhibition of DNA laddering & caspase-3 activity by zinc supplementation in cultured HeLa cells.
Abstract: The pathogenesis of influenza virus infection involves virus replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and the consequent degeneration of infected cells. Influenza virus induces cellular degeneration following infection of cultured cells in vitro, and the cytopathic effect (CPE) occurs principally through apoptotic cell death. This study was undertaken to fi nd out the effect of zinc on influenza virus induced apoptosis in cultured HeLa cells. The sub-confluent monolayer HeLa cells were used to study the effect of zinc on influenza virus induced apoptosis. The apoptotic markers viz., caspase-3 activity, phagocytic index, morphological changes, and DNA fragmentation were assayed. When HeLa cells were infected with a cell adapted pathogenic strain of influenza A (A/Udorn/ 317/72H(3)N(2)) virus, DNA fragmentation was observed in virus infected cells by 24 h post infection and caspase-3 activity was maximum at 4 h post infection after which it reached to plateau. Treatment of cells with 0.1 5mM concentration of zinc till 8 h post infection inhibited DNA fragmentation and also caspase 3 activity was decreased significantly up to 2 h post infection. When the infected HeLa cells were incubated with adherent macrophages, efficient phagocytosis occurred and the release of virus into the culture medium was inhibited. These results suggested that inhibitory effect on influenza virus induced apoptotic death of cultured cells can be determined at an early stage of the infection by treatment of zinc.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines zinc's effect on influenza-induced apoptosis in cultured cells, focusing on host response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Characterization of H3N6 avian influenza virus isolated from a wild white pelican in Zambia.
Abstract: We characterized an influenza virus isolated from a great white pelican in Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of its gene segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage and that they appear to have evolved in distinct geographical regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, suggesting reassortment of virus genes maintained in wild aquatic birds whose flyways overlap across these continents. It is notable that this virus might possess some genes of the same origin as those of highly pathogenic H7 and H5 viruses isolated in Eurasia. The present study underscores the need for continued monitoring of avian influenza viruses in Eurasia and Africa.

Title: Systems-based candidate genes for human response to influenza infection.
Abstract: Influenza A is a serious respiratory illness that can be debilitating and may cause complications leading to hospitalization and death. The outcome of infection with the influenza A virus is determined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors. With the ongoing threat of seasonal influenza and the potential emergence of new, more virulent strains of influenza viruses, we need to develop a better understanding of genetic variation in the human population and its association with severe outcomes from influenza infection. We propose a list of approximately 100 systems-based candidate genes for future study of the genetic basis of influenza disease and immunity in humans, based on evidence in the published literature for their potential role in the pathogenesis of this infection: binding of the virus to receptors on the host cell surface; cleavability of HA by host proteases; virus replication in host cells; destruction of host cells by apoptosis; state of immunocompetence of the individual host; and viral infections predisposing to bacterial infection.

Title: Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2009.
Abstract: This report updates the 2008 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccine for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza (CDC. Prevention and control of influenza: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2008;57[No. RR-7]). Information on vaccination issues related to the recently identified novel influenza A H1N1 virus will be published later in 2009. The 2009 seasonal influenza recommendations include new and updated information. Highlights of the 2009 recommendations include 1) a recommendation that annual vaccination be administered to all children aged 6 months-18 years for the 2009-10 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that vaccines containing the 2009-10 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens be used; and 3) a notice that recommendations for influenza diagnosis and antiviral use will be published before the start of the 2009-10 influenza season. Vaccination efforts should begin as soon as vaccine is available and continue through the influenza season. Approximately 83% of the United States population is specifically recommended for annual vaccination against seasonal influenza; however, <40% of the U.S. population received the 2008-09 influenza vaccine. These recommendations also include a summary of safety data for U.S. licensed influenza vaccines. These recommendations and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu); any updates or supplements that might be required during the 2009-10 influenza season also can be found at this website. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announcements of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information.

Title: Innate immune control and regulation of influenza virus infections.
Abstract: Adaptive immune responses are critical for the control and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, alveolar macrophages (aMphi), and dendritic cells (DC) are essential following IAV infection in the direct control of viral replication or in the induction and regulation of virus-specific adaptive immune responses. This review will discuss the role of these innate immune cells following IAV infection, with a particular focus on DC and their ability to induce and regulate the adaptive IAV-specific immune response.

Title: An accurate two-phase approximate solution to an acute viral infection model.
Abstract: During an acute viral infection, virus levels rise, reach a peak and then decline. Data and numerical solutions suggest the growth and decay phases are linear on a log scale. While viral dynamic models are typically nonlinear with analytical solutions difficult to obtain, the exponential nature of the solutions suggests approximations can be found. We derive a two-phase approximate solution to the target cell limited influenza model and illustrate its accuracy using data and previously established parameter values of six patients infected with influenza A. For one patient, the fall in virus concentration from its peak was not consistent with our predictions during the decay phase and an alternate approximation is derived. We find expressions for the rate and length of initial viral growth in terms of model parameters, the extent each parameter is involved in viral peaks, and the single parameter responsible for virus decay. We discuss applications of this analysis in antiviral treatments and in investigating host and virus heterogeneities.
Relevant: False

Title: Invasions by Eurasian avian influenza virus H6 genes and replacement of the virus' North American clade.
Abstract: The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) (H5N1) underlines the potential for global AIV movement through birds. The phylogenies of AIV genes from avian hosts usually separate into Eurasian and North American clades, reflecting limited bird migration between the hemispheres. However, mounting evidence that some H6 sequences from North America cluster with Eurasian subtype H6 sequences calls the strict hemispheric divide into question. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the extent and timing of cross-hemisphere movements by the H6 gene. Results suggested that Eurasian H6 subtype has invaded North America several times, with the first invasions occurring 10 years before the first detection of invading isolates. The members of the North American clade decreased from 100% in the 1980s to 20% in the 2000s among H6 isolates from North America. Unraveling the reasons for this large-scale gene movement between hemispheres might identify drivers of global AIV circulation.

Title: Avian influenza viruses in mammals.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 are remarkable because of their expanding non-avian host range and wide tissue tropism. They have caused severe or fatal respiratory and extra-respiratory disease in seven naturally infected species of carnivore. However, they are not unique in their ability to cross the species barrier, to cause clinical disease and mortality, or to replicate in extra-respiratory organs. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses have crossed from birds to swine, horses, harbour seals, whales and mink; have resulted in severe respiratory disease and mortality; and may have spread beyond the respiratory tract in some of these species. They are also transmitted from mammal to mammal in most species, and have become endemic in swine and horse populations, demonstrating their ability to adapt to and become sustained in mammals. Until now, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1 have not acquired this ability, but there are concerns that they may adapt to mammalian species and, thus, could spark an influenza pandemic in humans.

Title: Pathogenesis and pathobiology of avian influenza virus infection in birds.
Abstract: Avian influenza (AI) viruses vary in their ability to produce infection, disease and death in different bird species. Based on the pathobiological effect in chickens, AI viruses (AIV) are categorised as low pathogenic (LPAIV) or highly pathogenic (HPAIV). Typically, LPAIV cause asymptomatic infections in wild aquatic birds, but when introduced into domesticated poultry, infections may be asymptomatic or produce clinical signs and lesions reflecting pathophysiological damage to the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems. The HPAIV have primarily been seen in gallinaceous poultry, producing high morbidity and mortality, and systemic disease with necrosis and inflammation in multiple visceral organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems, and the integument. Although HPAIV have rarely infected domestic waterfowl or wild birds, the Eurasian-African H5N1 HPAIV have evolved over the past decade with the unique capacity to infect and cause disease in domestic ducks and wild birds, producing a range of syndromes including asymptomatic respiratory and digestive tract infections; systemic disease limited to two or three critical organs, usually the brain, heart and pancreas; and severe disseminated infection and death as seen in gallinaceous poultry. Although experimental studies using intranasal inoculation have produced infection in a variety of wild bird species, the inefficiency of contact transmission in some of them, for example, passerines and Columbiformes, suggests they are unlikely to be a reservoir for the viruses, while others such as some wild Anseriformes, can be severely affected and could serve as a dissemination host over intermediate distances.

Title: Single-reaction genomic amplification accelerates sequencing and vaccine production for classical and Swine origin human influenza a viruses.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza A viruses that emerge from animal reservoirs are inevitable. Therefore, rapid genomic analysis and creation of vaccines are vital. We developed a multisegment reverse transcription-PCR (M-RTPCR) approach that simultaneously amplifies eight genomic RNA segments, irrespective of virus subtype. M-RTPCR amplicons can be used for high-throughput sequencing and/or cloned into modified reverse-genetics plasmids via regions of sequence identity. We used these procedures to rescue a contemporary H3N2 virus and a swine origin H1N1 virus directly from human swab specimens. Together, M-RTPCR and the modified reverse-genetics plasmids that we designed streamline the creation of vaccine seed stocks (9 to 12 days).

Title: Drug delivery-mediated control of RNA immunostimulation.
Abstract: RNA interference (RNAi) has generated significant interest as a strategy to suppress viral infection, but in some cases antiviral activity of unmodified short-interfering RNA (siRNA) has been attributed to activation of innate immune responses. We hypothesized that immunostimulation by unmodified siRNA could mediate both RNAi as well as innate immune stimulation depending on the mode of drug delivery. We investigated the potential of immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) to suppress influenza A virus in vivo in the mouse lung. Lipidoid 98N12-5(1) formulated with unmodified siRNA targeting the influenza nucleoprotein gene exhibited antiviral activity. Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery. Here, we demonstrate that innate immune activation caused by unmodified siRNA can have therapeutically relevant effects, and that these non-RNAi effects can be controlled through chemical modifications and drug delivery.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies RNA immunostimulation and antiviral activity of siRNA delivery, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: What is the optimal therapy for patients with H5N1 influenza?
Abstract: In a 2007 article in PLoS Medicine[10], Holger J. Schünemann and colleagues described a new process used by the World Health Organization for rapidly developing clinical management guidelines in emergency situations. These situations include outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. The authors discussed how they developed such a "rapid advice" guideline for the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The guideline recommends giving the antiviral drug oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg twice daily for five days. In this Debate, Nicholas White argues that such dosing is inadequate, Robert Webster and Elena Govorkova say that combination antiviral therapy should be used, and Tim Uyeki reminds us that clinical care of patients with H5N1 entails much more than antiviral treatment. These issues may also apply to therapy of patients hospitalized with severe disease due to novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.

Title: Budding of filamentous and non-filamentous influenza A virus occurs via a VPS4 and VPS28-independent pathway.
Abstract: The mechanism of membrane scission during influenza A virus budding has been the subject of controversy. We confirm that influenza M1 binds VPS28, a subunit of the ESCRT-1 complex. However, confocal microscopy of infected cells showed no marked colocalisation between M1 and VPS28 or VPS4 ESCRT proteins, or relocalisation of the cellular proteins. Trafficking of HA and M1 appeared normal when endosomal sorting was impaired by expression of inactive VPS4. Overexpression of either isoform of VPS28 or wildtype or dominant negative VPS4 proteins did not alter production of filamentous virions. SiRNA depletion of endogenous VPS28 had no significant effect on influenza virus replication. Furthermore, cells expressing wildtype or dominant-negative VPS4 replicated filamentous and non-filamentous strains of influenza to similar titres, indicating that influenza release is VPS4-independent. Overall, we see no role for the ESCRT pathway in influenza virus budding and the significance of the M1-VPS28 interaction remains to be determined.

Title: Understanding the dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens through modeling the tempo of antigenic change: influenza as a case study.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving pathogens present a major conceptual and mathematical challenge to our understanding of disease dynamics. For these pathogens, the simulation of disease dynamics requires the use of computational models that incorporate pathogen evolution. Currently, these models are limited by two factors. First, their computational complexity hinders their numerical analysis and the ease with which parameters can be statistically estimated. Second, their formulations are frequently not sufficiently general to allow for alternative immunological hypotheses to be considered. Here, we introduce a new modeling framework for rapidly evolving pathogens that lessens both of these limitations. At its core, the proposed framework differs from previous multi-strain models by modeling the tempo of antigenic change instead of the pathogen's genetic change. This shift in focus results in a new model of reduced computational complexity that can accommodate different immunological hypotheses. We demonstrate the utility of this antigenic tempo model in an application to influenza. We show that, under different parameterizations, the model can reproduce the qualitative findings of a diverse set of previously published flu models, despite being less computationally intensive. These advantages of the antigenic tempo model make it a useful alternative to address several outstanding questions for rapidly evolving pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study focusing on antigenic change tempo rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links at the molecular or viral strain level.

Title: P58(IPK): a novel "CIHD" member of the host innate defense response against pathogenic virus infection.
Abstract: To support their replication, viruses take advantage of numerous cellular factors and processes. Recent large-scale screens have identified hundreds of such factors, yet little is known about how viruses exploit any of these. Influenza virus infection post-translationally activates P58(IPK), a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated eIF2alpha kinase, PKR. Here, we report that infection of P58(IPK) knockout mice with influenza virus resulted in increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation, and mortality. Analysis of lung transcriptional profiles, including those induced by the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus, revealed increased expression of genes associated with the cell death, immune, and inflammatory responses. These experiments represent the first use of a mammalian infection model to demonstrate the role of P58(IPK) in the antiviral response. Our results suggest that P58(IPK) represents a new class of molecule, a cellular inhibitor of the host defense (CIHD), as P58(IPK) is activated during virus infection to inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and inflammation to prolong host survival, even while prolonging viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host innate defense mechanisms and cellular factors during infection, not explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses isolated from pigs during 2000 to 2005 in Thailand.
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the existence of genetic diversity in swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in the world. In Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian-like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350-353). In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian-like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian-like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian-like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian-like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian-like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined. These observations may suggest that genes of avian-like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in other regions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of swine influenza viruses, describing genotypes and their origins, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Hedging against antiviral resistance during the next influenza pandemic using small stockpiles of an alternative chemotherapy.
Abstract: The effectiveness of single-drug antiviral interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality during the next influenza pandemic will be substantially weakened if transmissible strains emerge which are resistant to the stockpiled antiviral drugs. We developed a mathematical model to test the hypothesis that a small stockpile of a secondary antiviral drug could be used to mitigate the adverse consequences of the emergence of resistant strains. We used a multistrain stochastic transmission model of influenza to show that the spread of antiviral resistance can be significantly reduced by deploying a small stockpile (1% population coverage) of a secondary drug during the early phase of local epidemics. We considered two strategies for the use of the secondary stockpile: early combination chemotherapy (ECC; individuals are treated with both drugs in combination while both are available); and sequential multidrug chemotherapy (SMC; individuals are treated only with the secondary drug until it is exhausted, then treated with the primary drug). We investigated all potentially important regions of unknown parameter space and found that both ECC and SMC reduced the cumulative attack rate (AR) and the resistant attack rate (RAR) unless the probability of emergence of resistance to the primary drug p(A) was so low (less than 1 in 10,000) that resistance was unlikely to be a problem or so high (more than 1 in 20) that resistance emerged as soon as primary drug monotherapy began. For example, when the basic reproductive number was 1.8 and 40% of symptomatic individuals were treated with antivirals, AR and RAR were 67% and 38% under monotherapy if p(A) = 0.01. If the probability of resistance emergence for the secondary drug was also 0.01, then SMC reduced AR and RAR to 57% and 2%. The effectiveness of ECC was similar if combination chemotherapy reduced the probabilities of resistance emergence by at least ten times. We extended our model using travel data between 105 large cities to investigate the robustness of these resistance-limiting strategies at a global scale. We found that as long as populations that were the main source of resistant strains employed these strategies (SMC or ECC), then those same strategies were also effective for populations far from the source even when some intermediate populations failed to control resistance. In essence, through the existence of many wild-type epidemics, the interconnectedness of the global network dampened the international spread of resistant strains. Our results indicate that the augmentation of existing stockpiles of a single anti-influenza drug with smaller stockpiles of a second drug could be an effective and inexpensive epidemiological hedge against antiviral resistance if either SMC or ECC were used. Choosing between these strategies will require additional empirical studies. Specifically, the choice will depend on the safety of combination therapy and the synergistic effect of one antiviral in suppressing the emergence of resistance to the other antiviral when both are taken in combination.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper presents a mathematical model of antiviral resistance spread and intervention strategies but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inactivation of avian influenza virus using four common chemicals and one detergent.
Abstract: Five disinfectant chemicals were tested individually for effectiveness against low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), A/H7N2/Chick/MinhMa/04, on hard, nonporous surfaces. The tested agents included acetic acid, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and a powdered laundry detergent without bleach. Multiple common chemicals including acetic acid (1 and 3%), sodium hydroxide (2%), and calcium hydroxide (1%) effectively inactivated LPAIV on a metal surface. The laundry detergent without bleach, sodium carbonate (4%), and the lower concentration of sodium hydroxide (1%) were not able to consistently inactivate LPAIV on hard, nonporous surfaces.

Title: Sales of oseltamivir in Norway prior to the emergence of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses in 2007-08.
Abstract: An unprecedented high proportion of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses emerged in the 2007-08 influenza season. In Norway, two thirds of all tested A(H1N1) viruses were resistant to the antiviral drug. In order to see if this emergence could be explained by a drug induced selection pressure, we analysed data on the sales of oseltamivir in Norway for the years 2002-07. We used data from two sources; the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics Database and the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD), for the years 2002-2007. We calculated courses sold of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) per 1000 inhabitants per year. Our data showed that, except for the years 2005 and 2006, sales of oseltamivir were low in Norway; courses sold per 1000 inhabitants varied between 0.17-1.64. The higher sales in 2005 and 2006 we believe were caused by private stockpiling in fear of a pandemic, and do not represent actual usage. A drug induced selection pressure was probably not the cause of the emergence of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses in 2007-08 in Norway.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study analyzes oseltamivir sales and resistance emergence epidemiologically without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) in humans in the United States, 2005-2009.
Abstract: Triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses--containing genes from avian, human, and swine influenza viruses--emerged and became enzootic among pig herds in North America during the late 1990s. We report the clinical features of the first 11 sporadic cases of infection of humans with triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, occurring from December 2005 through February 2009, until just before the current epidemic of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) among humans. These data were obtained from routine national influenza surveillance reports and from joint case investigations by public and animal health agencies. The median age of the 11 patients was 10 years (range, 16 months to 48 years), and 4 had underlying health conditions. Nine of the patients had had exposure to pigs, five through direct contact and four through visits to a location where pigs were present but without contact. In another patient, human-to-human transmission was suspected. The range of the incubation period, from the last known exposure to the onset of symptoms, was 3 to 9 days. Among the 10 patients with known clinical symptoms, symptoms included fever (in 90%), cough (in 100%), headache (in 60%), and diarrhea (in 30%). Complete blood counts were available for four patients, revealing leukopenia in two, lymphopenia in one, and thrombocytopenia in another. Four patients were hospitalized, two of whom underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients received oseltamivir, and all 11 recovered from their illness. From December 2005 until just before the current human epidemic of swine-origin influenza viruses, there was sporadic infection with triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses in persons with exposure to pigs in the United States. Although all the patients recovered, severe illness of the lower respiratory tract and unusual influenza signs such as diarrhea were observed in some patients, including those who had been previously healthy.

Title: Isolation of sulfated galactan from Codium fragile and its antiviral effect.
Abstract: A sulfated galactan (FG) was isolated from the green alga, Codium fragile. Chemical analysis revealed that FG mainly consisted of D-galactose with pyruvic acid (12.3%) and sulfate (11.0%). Methylation and NMR analyses showed that FG was composed of -->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->, beta-D-Galp-(1--> and -->3,6)-beta-D-Galp-(1--> residue. In addition, pyruvic acid was suggested to be present as (1'-carboxy)-ethylidene cyclic ketal at O-3 and O-4 of non-reducing terminal galactose residues, whereas sulfate was substituted at O-4 of other galactose residues. When the antiviral potency of FG was evaluated, it inhibited the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and the mechanism of action was suggested to be interference in the early steps such as virus adsorption to and penetration into host cells. Furthermore, it was shown that FG directly reduced virus infection rates. In a genital infection model using HSV-2-infected mice, FG improved mortality and lesion scores and reduced virus yields by intravaginal administration. These results suggest that FG might be a potent candidate as a prophylactic agent for HSV-2 infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes isolation and antiviral effects of a sulfated galactan against HSV-2, unrelated to influenza viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Update: swine influenza A (H1N1) infections--California and Texas, April 2009.
Abstract: On April 21, 2009, CDC reported that two recent cases of febrile respiratory illness in children in southern California had been caused by infection with genetically similar swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses. The viruses contained a unique combination of gene segments that had not been reported previously among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Neither child had known contact with pigs, resulting in concern that human-to-human transmission might have occurred. The seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 strain is thought to be unlikely to provide protection. This report updates the status of the ongoing investigation and provides preliminary details about six additional persons infected by the same strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus identified in the previous cases, as of April 24. The six additional cases were reported in San Diego County, California (three cases), Imperial County, California (one case), and Guadalupe County, Texas (two cases). CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services are conducting case investigations, monitoring for illness in contacts of the eight patients, and enhancing surveillance to determine the extent of spread of the virus. CDC continues to recommend that any influenza A viruses that cannot be subtyped be sent promptly for testing to CDC. In addition, swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses of the same strain as those in the U.S. patients have been confirmed by CDC among specimens from patients in Mexico. Clinicians should consider swine influenza as well as seasonal influenza virus infections in the differential diagnosis for patients who have febrile respiratory illness and who 1) live in San Diego and Imperial counties, California, or Guadalupe County, Texas, or traveled to these counties or 2) who traveled recently to Mexico or were in contact with persons who had febrile respiratory illness and were in one of the three U.S. counties or Mexico during the 7 days preceding their illness onset.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States, September 28, 2008-April 4, 2009, and composition of the 2009-10 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from September 28, 2008, the start of the 2008-09 influenza season, through April 4, 2009, and reports on the 2009-10 influenza vaccine strain selection. Low levels of influenza activity were reported from October through early January. Activity increased from mid-January and peaked in mid-February. Influenza A (H1N1) viruses have predominated overall this season, but influenza B viruses have been isolated more frequently than influenza A viruses since mid-March. Widespread oseltamivir resistance was detected among circulating influenza A (H1N1) viruses and a high level of adamantane resistance was identified among influenza A (H3N2) viruses.

Title: High level expression of the anti-retroviral protein APOBEC3G is induced by influenza A virus but does not confer antiviral activity.
Abstract: Human APOBEC3G is an antiretroviral protein that was described to act via deamination of retroviral cDNA. However, it was suggested that APOBEC proteins might act with antiviral activity by yet other mechanisms and may also possess RNA deamination activity. As a consequence there is an ongoing debate whether APOBEC proteins might also act with antiviral activity on other RNA viruses. Influenza A viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, capable of inducing a variety of antiviral gene products. In searching for novel antiviral genes against these pathogens, we detected a strong induction of APOBEC3G but not APOBEC3F gene transcription in infected cells. This upregulation appeared to be induced by the accumulation of viral RNA species within the infected cell and occurred in an NF-kappaB dependent, but MAP kinase independent manner. It further turned out that APOBEC expression is part of a general IFNbeta response to infection. However, although strongly induced, APOBEC3G does not negatively affect influenza A virus propagation.

Abstract: In pro- and eukaryotic cells, RuvB-like protein 2 (RBL2) resolves Holliday junction recombination intermediates. Here, we identified RBL2 as a suppressor of influenza A virus replication. Human RBL2 appears to interfere with the oligomerization of the viral nucleoprotein, a critical step in the assembly of viral replication complexes.

Title: Interferon-induced ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza A virus gene expression and replication in human cells.
Abstract: The ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein, as well as its conjugating enzymes, is induced by type I interferons (IFNs). Experiments using ISG15 knockout (ISG15(-/-)) mice established that ISG15 and/or its conjugation inhibits the replication of influenza A virus. However, in contrast to the virus inhibition results for mice, the rates of virus replication in ISG15(+/+) and ISG15(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts in tissue culture were similar. Here we focus on human tissue culture cells and on the effect of ISG15 and/or its conjugation on influenza A virus gene expression and replication in such cells. We demonstrate that IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus in human cells is significantly alleviated by inhibiting ISG15 conjugation using small interfering RNAs directed against ISG15-conjugating enzymes. IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus protein synthesis was reduced 5- to 20-fold by suppressing ISG15 conjugation. The amounts of the viral proteins that were restored by these siRNA treatments were approximately 40 to 50% of the amounts produced in cells that were not pretreated with IFN. Further, we show that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza A virus replication 10- to 20-fold at early times after infection in human cells. These results show that ISG15 conjugation plays a substantial role in the antiviral state induced by IFN in human cells. In contrast, we show that in mouse embryo fibroblasts ISG15 conjugation not only does not affect influenza A virus replication but also does not contribute to the IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus gene expression.

Title: Bcl-2 expression and p38MAPK activity in cells infected with influenza A virus: impact on virally induced apoptosis and viral replication.
Abstract: Previous reports have shown that various steps in the influenza A virus life cycle are impaired in cells expressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Bcl-2(+) cells). We demonstrated a direct link between Bcl-2 and the reduced nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes in these cells. However, despite its negative impact on viral replication, Bcl-2 did not prevent host cells from undergoing virally triggered apoptosis. The protein's reduced antiapoptotic capacity was related to phosphorylation of its threonine 56 and serine 87 residues by virally activated p38MAPK. In infected Bcl-2(+) cells, activated p38MAPK was found predominantly in the cytoplasm, colocalized with Bcl-2, and both Bcl-2 phosphorylation and virally induced apoptosis were diminished by specific inhibition of p38MAPK activity. In contrast, in Bcl-2-negative (Bcl-2(-)) cells, which are fully permissive to viral infection, p38MAPK activity was predominantly nuclear, and its inhibition decreased vRNP traffic, phosphorylation of viral nucleoprotein, and virus titers in cell supernatants, suggesting that this kinase also contributes to the regulation of vRNP export and viral replication. This could explain why in Bcl-2(+) cells, where p38MAPK is active in the cytoplasm, phosphorylating Bcl-2, influenza viral replication is substantially reduced, whereas apoptosis proceeds at rates similar to those observed in Bcl-2(-) cells. Our findings suggest that the impact of p38MAPK on the influenza virus life cycle and the apoptotic response of host cells to infection depends on whether or not the cells express Bcl-2, highlighting the possibility that the pathological effects of the virus are partly determined by the cell type it targets.
Relevant: False

Title: WR1065 mitigates AZT-ddI-induced mutagenesis and inhibits viral replication.
Abstract: The success of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in treating HIV-1 infection and reducing mother-to-child transmission of the virus during pregnancy is accompanied by evidence that NRTIs cause long-term health risks for cancer and mitochondrial disease. Thus, agents that mitigate toxicities of the current combination drug therapies are needed. Previous work had shown that the NRTI-drug pair zidovudine (AZT)-didanosine (ddI) was highly cytotoxic and mutagenic; thus, we conducted preliminary studies to investigate the ability of the active moiety of amifostine, WR1065, to protect against the deleterious effects of this NRTI-drug pair. In TK6 cells exposed to 100 muM AZT-ddI (equimolar) for 3 days with or without 150 muM WR1065, WR1065 enhanced long-term cell survival and significantly reduced AZT-ddI-induced mutations. Follow-up studies were conducted to determine if coexposure to AZT and WR1065 abrogated the antiretroviral efficacy of AZT. In human T-cell blasts infected with HIV-1 in culture, inhibition of p24 protein production was observed in cells treated with 10 muM AZT in the absence or presence of 5-1,000 muM WR1065. Surprisingly, WR1065 alone exhibited dose-related inhibition of HIV-1 p24 protein production. WR1065 also had antiviral efficacy against three species of adenovirus and influenza A and B. Intracellular levels of unbound WR1065 were measured following in vitro/in vivo drug exposure. These pilot study results indicate that WR1065, at low intracellular levels, has cytoprotective and antimutagenic activities against the most mutagenic pair of NRTIs and has broad spectrum antiviral effects. These findings suggest that the activities have a possible common mode of action that merits further investigation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies WR1065 effects on mutagenesis and viral replication broadly but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fluorescent dye labeled influenza virus mainly infects innate immune cells and activated lymphocytes and can be used in cell-mediated immune response assay.
Abstract: Early results have recognized that influenza virus infects the innate and adaptive immune cells. The data presented in this paper demonstrated that influenza virus labeled with fluorescent dye not only retained the ability to infect and replicate in host cells, but also stimulated a similar human immune response as did unlabeled virus. Influenza virus largely infected the innate and activated adaptive immune cells. Influenza B type virus was different from that of A type virus. B type virus was able to infect the immature lymphocytes, but in lower amounts when compared to activated lymphocytes. Protection from influenza is tightly associated with cellular immunity. Traditional methods of cellular immunity assay had limitations to imitate the natural human cell-mediated responses to influenza virus. Labeled viruses could be used in the assay of virus-specific cytotoxicity, which might reflect the natural process more closely. Furthermore, human immune cells activated by one influenza subtype virus could kill the cells infected by other subtype virus. These results implied the human immune cells could directly handle and remove free virus using similar mechanism that was used to remove virus-infected nonimmune cells, which might help to simplify the design and production of influenza vaccine, thereby reduce the cost.

Reason: The paper focuses on infection patterns of influenza virus labeled with fluorescent dye and immune response assays, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus (H5N1); effects of physico-chemical factors on its survival.
Abstract: Present study was performed to determine the effects of physical and chemical agents on infective potential of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (local strain) virus recently isolated in Pakistan during 2006 outbreak. H5N1 virus having titer 10(8.3) ELD(50)/ml was mixed with sterilized peptone water to get final dilution of 4HA units and then exposed to physical (temperature, pH and ultraviolet light) and chemical (formalin, phenol crystals, iodine crystals, CID 20, virkon-S, zeptin 10%, KEPCIDE 300, KEPCIDE 400, lifebuoy, surf excel and caustic soda) agents. Harvested amnio-allantoic fluid (AAF) from embryonated chicken eggs inoculated with H5N1 treated virus (0.2 ml/egg) was subjected to haemagglutination (HA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. H5N1 virus lost infectivity after 30 min at 56 degrees C, after 1 day at 28 degrees C but remained viable for more than 100 days at 4 degrees C. Acidic pH (1, 3) and basic pH (11, 13) were virucidal after 6 h contact time; however virus retained infectivity at pH 5 (18 h), 7 and 9 (more than 24 h). UV light was proved ineffectual in inactivating virus completely even after 60 min. Soap (lifebuoy), detergent (surf excel) and alkali (caustic soda) destroyed infectivity after 5 min at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% dilution. All commercially available disinfectants inactivated virus at recommended concentrations. Results of present study would be helpful in implementing bio-security measures at farms/hatcheries levels in the wake of avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreak.

Title: Protection of chickens against avian influenza with nonreplicating adenovirus-vectored vaccine.
Abstract: Protective immunity against avian influenza (AI) virus has been elicited in chickens by single-dose in ovo or i.m. vaccination with a replication-competent adenovirus (Ad)-free human Ad vector encoding the AI virus A/Turkey/Wisconsin/68 H5 (AdTW68. H5) or the A/Chicken/New York/94 H7 (AdChNY94. H7) hemagglutinin (HA). The AdTW68.H5-vaccinated chickens were protected against both H5N1 and H5N2 highly pathogenic AI virus challenges. The AdChNY94. H7-vaccinated chickens were protected against an H7N3 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus challenge. Chickens vaccinated in ovo with AdTW68.H5 followed by posthatch i.m. vaccination with AdChNY94.H7 responded to both vaccinations, with robust antibody titers against both the H5 and H7 AI proteins. The use of a synthetic AI H5 HA gene codon optimized to match the tRNA pool found in chicken cells is more potent than the cognate H5 HA gene. Mass administration of this AI vaccine can be streamlined with available robotic in ovo injectors. In addition, Ad5-vectored vaccines can be produced rapidly and the safety margin of the nonreplicating vector is superior to that of a replicating counterpart. Furthermore, this mode of vaccination will not interfere with epidemiological surveys of natural AI infections. Finally, the demonstration that Ad-vectored vaccines can be administered repeatedly without appreciably losing potency highlights the commercial potential of this new class of vaccine in poultry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on vaccine development and immune protection in chickens, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: PrimerHunter: a primer design tool for PCR-based virus subtype identification.
Abstract: Rapid and reliable virus subtype identification is critical for accurate diagnosis of human infections, effective response to epidemic outbreaks and global-scale surveillance of highly pathogenic viral subtypes such as avian influenza H5N1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the method of choice for virus subtype identification. However, designing subtype-specific PCR primer pairs is a very challenging task: on one hand, selected primer pairs must result in robust amplification in the presence of a significant degree of sequence heterogeneity within subtypes, on the other, they must discriminate between the subtype of interest and closely related subtypes. In this article, we present a new tool, called PrimerHunter, that can be used to select highly sensitive and specific primers for virus subtyping. Our tool takes as input sets of both target and nontarget sequences. Primers are selected such that they efficiently amplify any one of the target sequences, and none of the nontarget sequences. PrimerHunter ensures the desired amplification properties by using accurate estimates of melting temperature with mismatches, computed based on the nearest neighbor model via an efficient fractional programming algorithm. Validation experiments with three avian influenza HA subtypes confirm that primers selected by PrimerHunter have high sensitivity and specificity for target sequences.
Relevant: False

Title: Characterization of avian influenza viruses A (H5N1) from wild birds, Hong Kong, 2004-2008.
Abstract: From January 2004 through June 2008, surveillance of dead wild birds in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, periodically detected highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (H5N1) in individual birds from different species. During this period, no viruses of subtype H5N1 were detected in poultry on farms and in markets in Hong Kong despite intensive surveillance. Thus, these findings in wild birds demonstrate the potential for wild birds to disseminate HPAI viruses (H5N1) to areas otherwise free from the viruses. Genetic and antigenic characterization of 47 HPAI (H5N1) viruses isolated from dead wild birds in Hong Kong showed that these isolates belonged to 2 antigenically distinct virus groups: clades 2.3.4 and 2.3.2. Although research has shown that clade 2.3.4 viruses are established in poultry in Asia, the emergence of clade 2.3.2 viruses in nonpasserine birds from Hong Kong, Japan, and Russia raises the possibility that this virus lineage may have become established in wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports genetic and antigenic characterization of H5N1 viruses from wild birds but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Use of oseltamivir in 12 European countries between 2002 and 2007--lack of association with the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses.
Abstract: Variable levels of oseltamivir resistance among seasonal influenza A(H1N1) isolates have been reported in Europe during the 2007-8 northern Hemisphere influenza season. It has been questioned whether oseltamivir use could have driven the emergence and predominance of resistant viruses. This study aimed at describing the levels of use of oseltamivir in 12 European Union (EU) Member States and European Economic Area (EEA)/European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries. The data were converted into prescription rates and compared with the national proportions of resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses through regression analysis. Overall use of oseltamivir in European countries between 2002 and 2007 was low compared to e.g. the use in Japan. High variability between the countries and over time was observed. In eight of the 12 countries, there was a peak of prescriptions in 2005, coinciding with concerns about a perceived threat from an influenza pandemic which might have lead to personal stockpiling. Ecological comparison between national levels of use of oseltamivir in 2007 and the proportions of A(H1N1) viruses that were resistant to oseltamivir showed no statistical association. In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that the emergence and persistence of these viruses in 2007-8 was related to the levels of use of oseltamivir in Europe. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the reasons for different level of use between the countries.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an epidemiological study correlating oseltamivir use with resistance emergence, without explicit genotype-phenotype mechanistic links.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, September 28, 2008--January 31, 2009.
Abstract: From September 28, 2008, to January 31, 2009, influenza activity remained low in the United States but began to increase at the end of January. Thus far during the 2008-09 influenza season, influenza A viruses have predominated and are antigenically related to the 2008-09 influenza vaccine strains. Oseltamivir resistance has been detected in nearly all of the influenza A (H1N1) viruses tested so far during the 2008-09 season, with high levels of adamantane resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews interim recommendations for the use of influenza antiviral medications.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a surveillance report summarizing influenza activity and resistance patterns without detailed genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Electroporation of synthetic DNA antigens offers protection in nonhuman primates challenged with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Avian influenza highlights the need for novel vaccination techniques that would allow for the rapid design and production of safe and effective vaccines. An ideal platform would be capable of inducing both protective antibodies and potent cellular immune responses. These potential advantages of DNA vaccines remain unrealized due to a lack of efficacy in large animal studies and in human trials. Questions remain regarding the potential utility of cellular immune responses against influenza virus in primates. In this study, by construct optimization and in vivo electroporation of synthetic DNA-encoded antigens, we observed the induction of cross-reactive cellular and humoral immune responses individually capable of providing protection from influenza virus infection in the rhesus macaque. These studies advance the DNA vaccine field and provide a novel, more tolerable vaccine with broad immunogenicity to avian influenza virus. This approach appears important for further investigation, including studies with humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on vaccine development and immune responses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in frozen duck carcasses, Germany, 2007.
Abstract: We conducted phylogenetic and epidemiologic analyses to determine sources of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), subtype H5N1, in poultry holdings in 2007 in Germany, and a suspected incursion of HPAIV into the food chain through contaminated deep-frozen duck carcasses. In summer 2007, HPAIV (H5N1) outbreaks in 3 poultry holdings in Germany were temporally, spatially, and phylogenetically linked to outbreaks in wild aquatic birds. Detection of HPAIV (H5N1) in frozen duck carcass samples of retained slaughter batches of 1 farm indicated that silent infection had occurred for some time before the incidental detection. Phylogenetic analysis established a direct epidemiologic link between HPAIV isolated from duck meat and strains isolated from 3 further outbreaks in December 2007 in backyard chickens that had access to uncooked offal from commercial deep-frozen duck carcasses. Measures that will prevent such undetected introduction of HPAIV (H5N1) into the food chain are urgently required.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic and epidemiologic analyses of H5N1 outbreaks and contamination but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Incorporating demographic stochasticity into multi-strain epidemic models: application to influenza A.
Abstract: We develop mathematical models of the transmission and evolution of multi-strain pathogens that incorporate strain extinction and the stochastic generation of new strains via mutation. The dynamics resulting from these models is then examined with the applied aim of understanding the mechanisms underpinning the evolution and dynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, such as human influenza viruses. Our approach, while analytically relatively simple, gives results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained from much more complex individually based simulation models. We examine strain dynamics as a function of cross-immunity and key transmission parameters, and show that introducing strain extinction and modelling mutation as a stochastic process significantly changes the model dynamics, leading to lower strain diversity, reduced infection prevalence and shorter strain lifetimes. Finally, we incorporate transient strain-transcending immunity in the model and demonstrate that it reduces strain diversity further, giving patterns of sequential strain replacement similar to that seen in human influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study of multi-strain epidemic dynamics and evolution, without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A TLR3 ligand that exhibits potent inhibition of influenza virus replication and has strong adjuvant activity has the potential for dual applications in an influenza pandemic.
Abstract: The appearance and spread of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) raise concern of a possible pandemic. Current preventive measures include the development of a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine and stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors. However, their benefits can be significantly reduced by mutations in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase resulting in antigenic changes and the appearance of drug-resistance, respectively. Drugs that target the innate immune system to achieve a 'heightened antiviral' state represent another class of antiviral agents that could contribute to the control and treatment of influenza infection. In this study, PIKA (a stabilized dsRNA) provides broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses. In addition, when PIKA was admixed with influenza vaccine preparations, including a formalin-inactivated whole-virion H5 vaccine, significant adjuvanting effect leading to accelerated viral clearance was observed in a murine model. These biological effects appear to be mediated by the ability of PIKA to promote the maturation of dendritic cells, including up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, and the induction of various cytokines and chemokines. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was shown to recognize PIKA in a concentration-dependent manner. The potency and versatility in its activities make PIKA an attractive candidate for use in an influenza pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immunological effects of a TLR3 ligand and its antiviral activity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Learning to count: robust estimates for labeled distances between molecular sequences.
Abstract: Researchers routinely estimate distances between molecular sequences using continuous-time Markov chain models. We present a new method, robust counting, that protects against the possibly severe bias arising from model misspecification. We achieve this robustness by generalizing the conventional distance estimation to incorporate the empirical distribution of site patterns found in the observed pairwise sequence alignment. Our flexible framework allows for computing distances based only on a subset of possible substitutions. From this, we show how to estimate labeled codon distances, such as expected numbers of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions. We present two simulation studies. The first compares the relative bias and variance of conventional and robust labeled nucleotide estimators. In the second simulation, we demonstrate that robust counting furnishes accurate synonymous and nonsynonymous distance estimates based only on easy-to-fit models of nucleotide substitution, bypassing the need for computationally expensive codon models. We conclude with three empirical examples. In the first two examples, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza A hemagglutinin gene using labeled codon distances. In the final example, we demonstrate the advantages of using robust synonymous distances to alleviate the effect of convergent evolution on phylogenetic analysis of an HIV transmission network.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methodological paper on estimating molecular sequence distances and evolutionary dynamics, not directly linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza a virus induces an immediate cytotoxic activity in all major subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Abstract: A replication defective influenza A vaccine virus (delNS1 virus) was developed. Its attenuation is due to potent stimulation of the innate immune system by the virus. Since the innate immune system can also target cancer cells, we reasoned that delNS1 virus induced immune-stimulation should also lead to the induction of innate cytotoxic effects towards cancer cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ subsets and different combinations of the above subsets were stimulated by delNS1, wild type (wt) virus or heat inactivated virus and co-cultured with tumor cell lines in the presence or absence of antibodies against the interferon system. Stimulation of PBMCs by the delNS1 virus effectively induced cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, virus induced cytotoxicity was exerted by all major subtypes of PBMCs including CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells. Virus induced cytotoxicity in CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells was dependent on virus replication, whereas virus induced cytotoxicity in CD56+ cells was only dependent on the binding of the virus. Virus induced cytotoxicity of isolated cell cultures of CD14+, CD19+ or CD56+ cells could be partially blocked by antibodies against type I and type II (IFN) interferon. In contrast, virus induced cytotoxicity in the complete PBMC preparation could not be inhibited by blocking type I or type II IFN, indicating a redundant system of activation in whole blood. Our data suggest that apart from their well known specialized functions all main subsets of peripheral blood cells also initially exert a cytotoxic effect upon virus stimulation. This closely links the innate immune system to the adaptive immune response and renders delNS1 virus a potential therapeutic tool for viro-immunotherapy of cancer.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies innate immune cytotoxicity induced by influenza virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Characterization of a Canadian mink H3N2 influenza A virus isolate genetically related to triple reassortant swine influenza virus.
Abstract: In 2007, an H3N2 influenza A virus was isolated from Canadian mink. This virus was found to be phylogenetically related to a triple reassortant influenza virus which emerged in Canadian swine in 2005, but it is antigenically distinct. The transmission of the virus from swine to mink seems to have occurred following the feeding of animals with a ration composed of uncooked meat by-products of swine obtained from slaughterhouse facilities. Serological analyses suggest that the mink influenza virus does not circulate in the swine population. Presently, the prevalence of influenza virus in Canadian farmed and wild mink populations is unknown. The natural occurrence of influenza virus infection in mink with the presence of clinical signs is a rare event that deserves to be reported.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes phylogenetic and epidemiologic characteristics of a mink H3N2 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A method for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping genes.
Abstract: Inferring the intensity of positive selection in protein-coding genes is important since it is used to shed light on the process of adaptation. Recently, it has been reported that overlapping genes, which are ubiquitous in all domains of life, seem to exhibit inordinate degrees of positive selection. Here, we present a new method for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping genes. We show that the appearance of positive selection is caused by assuming that selection operates independently on each gene in an overlapping pair, thereby ignoring the unique evolutionary constraints on overlapping coding regions. Our method uses an exact evolutionary model, thereby voiding the need for approximation or intensive computation. We test the method by simulating the evolution of overlapping genes of different types as well as under diverse evolutionary scenarios. Our results indicate that the independent estimation approach leads to the false appearance of positive selection even though the gene is in reality subject to negative selection. Finally, we use our method to estimate selection in two influenza A genes for which positive selection was previously inferred. We find no evidence for positive selection in both cases.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on a method to estimate selection intensities in overlapping genes and evolutionary analysis, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Mechanism of NKT cell activation by intranasal coadministration of alpha-galactosylceramide, which can induce cross-protection against influenza viruses.
Abstract: In a nasal vaccine against influenza, the activation of natural killer T (NKT) cells by intranasal coadministration of alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) can potently enhance protective immune responses. The results of this study show that the NKT cell-activated nasal vaccine can induce an effective cross-protection against different strains of influenza virus, including H5 type. To analyze the mechanism of NKT cell activation by this nasal vaccine, we prepared fluorescence-labeled alpha-GalCer by which we detect a direct interaction between NKT cells and alpha-GalCer-stored dendritic cells in nasal mucosa-associated tissues. Accordingly, although very few NKT cells exist at mucosa, the nasal vaccination induced a localized increase in NKT cell population, which is partly dependent on CXCL16/CXCR6. Furthermore, we found that NKT cell activation stimulates mucosal IgA production by a mechanism that is dependent on interleukin (IL)-4 production. These results strengthen the basis of nasal vaccination via NKT cell activation, which can induce immune cross-protection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune activation mechanisms by a vaccine adjuvant and NKT cells, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States, September 28-November 29, 2008.
Abstract: During September 28-November 29, 2008, influenza activity remained low in the United States. Of the few influenza viruses characterized thus far this season, most are antigenically related to the strains included in the 2008-09 influenza vaccine. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses have been detected, but currently available data are insufficient to predict their prevalence for the 2008-09 season. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews new influenza vaccine recommendations for the current season.

Title: First case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Spain.
Abstract: The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus has been involved in severe mortality in domestic poultry, and has also been found in different species of wildlife in Europe. The Basque Country avian influenza surveillance program began sample collection and processing the fall of 2005. Here we report the first confirmation of the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 strain in a Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) found dead in a pond near Vitoria in the Basque Country on the North of Spain. Regarding the survey for generic influenza type A virus, we have obtained positive results in about 8% of more that 3500 birds examined. We think that the self-limiting nature of our finding and others proves that certain regions have ecological, geographical and climatological features that make it difficult for the H5N1 virus to spread 1 and cause disease at least in the large scale scenario that has been worrying human and animal health authorities during the last years.

Title: CXCR3-deficiency protects influenza-infected CCR5-deficient mice from mortality.
Abstract: Mice lacking the chemokine receptor CCR5 are susceptible to mortality from a normally non-lethal influenza infection. Here we found that CXCR3-deficiency rescued CCR5-deficient (CCR5(-/-)) mice from influenza-induced mortality. The number of mononuclear phagocytes in the airways was transiently increased in CCR5(-/-) mice but not in CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient mice. Antigen-specific CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient CD8 effector cells were less efficient at entering the airways compared with WT or CCR5(-/-) CD8 effector cells. The decrease in inflammatory cell infiltrates in CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient-infected mice correlated with a decrease in CCL2 and IFN-gamma production in the airways. Finally, CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient mice that survived the primary viral challenge were protected from a lethal secondary challenge, indicating that T-cell-mediated protective memory was not compromised in mice lacking these chemokine receptors. In conclusion, CXCR3-deficiency attenuated the lethal cellular immune response in CCR5(-/-) influenza-infected mice without hindering viral clearance or long-term immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune response and chemokine receptor deficiency effects on influenza infection outcome, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: [Resistance in influenza viruses].
Abstract: Influenza virus infection can be prevented and treated with antiviral drugs. The usage of such drugs in Norway has been infrequent, however, they are an important component in our pandemic preparedness planning, as it will probably be difficult to get access to the appropriate vaccine in time before the pandemic reaches the country. The first generation of influenza drugs acquired resistance to a large degree, in contrast to the modern neuraminidase inhibitors that until recently have had minor problems with resistance. This review is based on research found in relevant published literature, together with experience from a virology reference laboratory and participation in a national and international surveillance including susceptibility testing. While resistance has been a longstanding problem with the use of the "old" influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine, only during the winter 2007/2008 did it become clear, that a certain type of virus acquired widespread resistance against the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. Resistance surveillance is crucial for the correct choice of empiric treatment for influenza infection, and will be one of the most important tasks at the National Influenza Centre in certain phases of a pandemic. The current situation with an increasing resistance problem strengthens the need to conduct continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility, as well as development of new antiviral drugs and treatment regimes.

Title: Therapeutic activity of an anti-idiotypic antibody-derived killer peptide against influenza A virus experimental infection.
Abstract: The in vitro and in vivo activities of a killer decapeptide (KP) against influenza A virus is described, and the mechanisms of action are suggested. KP represents the functional internal image of a yeast killer toxin that proved to exert antimicrobial and anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activities. Treatment with KP demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity on the replication of two strains of influenza A virus in different cell lines, as evaluated by hemagglutination, hemadsorption, and plaque assays. The complete inhibition of virus particle production and a marked reduction of the synthesis of viral proteins (membrane protein and hemagglutinin, in particular) were observed at a KP concentration of 4 microg/ml. Moreover, KP administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 microg/mice once a day for 10 days to influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus-infected mice improved the survival of the animals by 40% and significantly decreased the viral titers in their lungs. Overall, KP appears to be the first anti-idiotypic antibody-derived peptide that displays inhibitory activity and that has a potential therapeutic effect against pathogenic microorganisms, HIV-1, and influenza A virus by different mechanisms of action.

Title: Neuraminidase activity provides a practical read-out for a high throughput influenza antiviral screening assay.
Abstract: The emergence of influenza strains that are resistant to commonly used antivirals has highlighted the need to develop new compounds that target viral gene products or host mechanisms that are essential for effective virus replication. Existing assays to identify potential antiviral compounds often use high throughput screening assays that target specific viral replication steps. To broaden the search for antivirals, cell-based replication assays can be performed, but these are often labor intensive and have limited throughput. We have adapted a traditional virus neutralization assay to develop a practical, cell-based, high throughput screening assay. This assay uses viral neuraminidase (NA) as a read-out to quantify influenza replication, thereby offering an assay that is both rapid and sensitive. In addition to identification of inhibitors that target either viral or host factors, the assay allows simultaneous evaluation of drug toxicity. Antiviral activity was demonstrated for a number of known influenza inhibitors including amantadine that targets the M2 ion channel, zanamivir that targets NA, ribavirin that targets IMP dehydrogenase, and bis-indolyl maleimide that targets protein kinase A/C. Amantadine-resistant strains were identified by comparing IC50 with that of the wild-type virus. Antivirals with specificity for a broad range of targets are easily identified in an accelerated viral inhibition assay that uses NA as a read-out of replication. This assay is suitable for high throughput screening to identify potential antivirals or can be used to identify drug-resistant influenza strains.

Title: Climate change and avian influenza.
Abstract: This paper discusses impacts of climate change on the ecology of avian influenza viruses (AI viruses), which presumably co-evolved with migratory water birds, with virus also persisting outside the host in subarctic water bodies. Climate change would almost certainly alter bird migration, influence the AI virus transmission cycle and directly affect virus survival outside the host. The joint, net effects of these changes are rather unpredictable, but it is likely that AI virus circulation in water bird populations will continue with endless adaptation and evolution. In domestic poultry, too little is known about the direct effect of environmental factors on highly pathogenic avian influenza transmission and persistence to allow inference about the possible effect of climate change. However, possible indirect links through changes in the distribution of duck-crop farming are discussed.

Title: High-throughput screening of a 100,000-compound library for inhibitors of influenza A virus (H3N2).
Abstract: Using a highly reproducible and robust cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, the authors screened a 100,000-compound library at 14- and 114-microM compound concentration against influenza strain A/Udorn/72 (H3N2). The "hit" rates (>50% inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect) from the 14- and 114-microM screens were 0.022% and 0.38%, respectively. The hits were evaluated for their antiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity in dose-response experiments. The screen at the lower concentration yielded 3 compounds, which displayed moderate activity (SI(50) = 10-49). Intriguingly, the screen at the higher concentration revealed several additional hits. Two of these hits were highly active with an SI(50) > 50. Time of addition experiments revealed 1 compound that inhibited early and 4 other compounds that inhibited late in the virus life cycle, suggesting they affect entry and replication, respectively. The active compounds represent several different classes of molecules such as carboxanilides, 1-benzoyl-3-arylthioureas, sulfonamides, and benzothiazinones, which have not been previously identified as having antiviral/anti-influenza activity.

Title: Protein kinase C theta regulates stability of the peripheral adhesion ring junction and contributes to the sensitivity of target cell lysis by CTL.
Abstract: Destruction of virus-infected cells by CTL is an extremely sensitive and efficient process. Our previous data suggest that LFA-1-ICAM-1 interactions in the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) of the immunological synapse mediate formation of a tight adhesion junction that might contribute to the sensitivity of target cell lysis by CTL. Herein, we compared more (CD8(+)) and less (CD4(+)) effective CTL to understand the molecular events that promote efficient target cell lysis. We found that abrogation of the pSMAC formation significantly impaired the ability of CD8(+) but not CD4(+) CTL to lyse target cells despite having no effect of the amount of released granules by both CD8(+) and CD4(+) CTL. Consistent with this, CD4(+) CTL break their synapses more often than do CD8(+) CTL, which leads to the escape of the cytolytic molecules from the interface. CD4(+) CTL treatment with a protein kinase Ctheta inhibitor increases synapse stability and sensitivity of specific target cell lysis. Thus, formation of a stable pSMAC, which is partially controlled by protein kinase Ctheta, functions to confine the released lytic molecules at the synaptic interface and to enhance the effectiveness of target cell lysis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates CTL-mediated target cell lysis mechanisms, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Improving the realism of deterministic multi-strain models: implications for modelling influenza A.
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for antigenically variable pathogens remains a challenge, particularly if analytical insight is wanted. In particular, while a variety of relatively complex simulation models have reproduced the evolutionary dynamics of influenza, simpler models have given less satisfying descriptions of the patterns seen in data. Here, we develop a set of relatively simple deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi-strain pathogens which give increased biological realism compared with past work. We allow the intensity of cross-immunity generated against one strain given exposure to a different strain to depend on the extent of genetic difference between the strains. We show that the dynamics of this model are determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function and can include fully symmetric equilibria, self-organized strain structures, regular periodic and chaotic regimes. We then extend the model by incorporating transient strain-transcending immunity that acts as a density-dependent mechanism to lower overall infection prevalence and thus pathogen diversity. We conclude that while some aspects of the evolution of influenza can be captured by deterministic models, overall, the description obtainable using a purely deterministic framework is unsatisfactory, implying that stochasticity of strain generation (via mutation) and extinction needs to be captured to appropriately capture influenza dynamics.

Title: Vaccination and antigenic drift in influenza.
Abstract: The relationship between influenza antigenic drift and vaccination lies at the intersection of evolutionary biology and public health, and it must be viewed and analyzed in both contexts simultaneously. In this paper, 1 review what is known about the effects of antigenic drift on vaccination and the effects of vaccination on antigenic drift, and I suggest some simple ways to detect the presence of antigenic drift in seasonal influenza data. If antigenic drift occurs on the time scale of a single influenza season, it may be associated with the presence of herd immunity at the beginning of the season and may indicate a need to monitor for vaccine updates at the end of the season. The relationship between antigenic drift and vaccination must also be viewed in the context of the global circulation of influenza strains and the seeding of local and regional epidemics. In the data sets I consider--from New Zealand, New York, and France--antigenic drift can be statistically detected during some seasons, and seeding of epidemics appears to be endogenous sometimes and exogenous at other times. Improved detection of short-term antigenic drift and epidemic seeding would significantly benefit influenza monitoring efforts and vaccine selection.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2007.
Abstract: The year 2007 saw the most severe influenza season since national reporting of influenza began in 2001. Early in the season the National Incident Room was activated to provide effective national surveillance, reporting and management of the 2007 seasonal influenza outbreak. A surveillance team were tasked with establishing enhanced surveillance for the 2007 season and investigating unusual events in this outbreak. Key data required to comprehensively describe the number of cases, morbidity, mortality and virology of the influenza outbreak and the possible sources of these data were identified. In 2007 the number of laboratory-confirmed notifications for influenza was 3.1 times higher than the five-year mean. Forty-four per cent of notifications occurred in Queensland. High notification rates were reflected in an increase in presentations with influenza-like illness to sentinel general practices and Emergency Departments. Notifications and notification rates were highest in the 0-4 and 5-9 years age groups, possibly due to a bias towards testing in these age groups. The clinical morbidity of the infection in terms of complications or most affected groups cannot be determined but anecdotal reports indicate this season may have impacted young adults more than is usual. The available data suggest influenza has caused a significant burden on workplaces and the health care system as indicated by data on absenteeism and presentations for health care. The proportion of H1 strains of influenza circulating varied across Australia but was higher than 2006 in most jurisdictions. In 2007, 1,406 influenza isolates from Australia were antigenically analysed at the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne: 58.7% were A(H3N2), 34.4% were A(H1N1) and 6.9% were influenza B viruses. Antigenic drift away from the vaccine strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005 was observed with the A(H3N2) viruses and was also seen with most of the A(H1N1) viruses when compared with the vaccine strain A/New Caledonia/20/99. The small number of influenza B viruses examined were predominately of the B/Yamagata-lineage. Monitoring influenza through the National Incident Room during the 2007 season offered an excellent opportunity to conduct enhanced surveillance under conditions that were real and potentially serious but not an emergency. It enabled the current state of our surveillance systems to be assessed and opportunities for improvement to be identified.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is an annual surveillance report describing epidemiological and antigenic data of influenza viruses without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) virus: a Hong Kong perspective (1997-2006).
Abstract: The underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza A viruses is still uncertain. Phylogenetic studies investigated this phenomenon but have lacked sequences from more subtropical and tropical regions, particularly from Southeast Asia. 281 complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences were obtained from influenza A(H3N2) viruses, collected over 10 years (1997-2006) from Hong Kong. These dated sequences were analyzed with influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere, worldwide. In addition, the NA sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring, known, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance-associated amino acid mutations (R292K and E119V). Before 2001, the Hong Kong HA and NA sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99) than did sequences from elsewhere. After 2001, this trend reversed with significant clusters containing HA and NA sequences from different locations, isolated at different times, suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza A(H3N2) seasonality during this 10-year period. However, at least one example from Hong Kong was found suggesting that in some years, influenza A(H3N2) viruses may persist in the same location, perhaps continuing to circulate, sub-clinically, at low levels between seasons, to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year, relatively unchanged. None of these Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) NA sequences contained any of the known NAI-resistance associated mutations. The seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) may be largely due to global migration, with similar viruses appearing in different countries at different times. However, occasionally, some viruses may remain within a single location and continue to circulate within that population, to re-emerge during the next influenza season, with relatively little genetic change. Naturally occurring NAI resistance mutations were absent or, at least, very rare in this population.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with some mention of known resistance mutations, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus isolated in wild waterfowl in Argentina: evidence of a potentially unique phylogenetic lineage in South America.
Abstract: Avian influenza (AI) viruses have been sporadically isolated in South America. The most recent reports are from an outbreak in commercial poultry in Chile in 2002 and its putative ancestor from a wild bird in Bolivia in 2001. Extensive surveillance in wild birds was carried out in Argentina during 2006-2007. Using RRT-PCR, 12 AI positive detections were made from cloacal swabs. One of those positive samples yielded an AI virus isolated from a wild kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) captured in the South Atlantic coastline of Argentina. Further characterization by nucleotide sequencing reveals that it belongs to the H13N9 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 viral genes suggests that the 6 internal genes are related to the isolates from Chile and Bolivia. The analysis also indicates that a cluster of phylogenetically related AI viruses from South America may have evolved independently, with minimal gene exchange, from influenza viruses in other latitudes. The data produced from our investigations are valuable contributions to the study of AI viruses in South America.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza viruses in South America but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza A H5N1 infections in cats.
Abstract: Although cats had been considered resistant to disease from influenza virus infection, domestic cats and large felids are now known to be naturally und experimentally susceptible to infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). The virus causes systemic infection, lung and liver being the mainly affected organs. Infected cats show fever, depression, dyspnoea, and neurological signs, but subclinical infections have also occurred. Mostly, cats have been infected by direct contact with affected birds, especially by eating raw poultry; transmission from cat to cat may also occur. Little is known about the role of cats in the epidemiology of the virus. So far, no reassortment between avian and mammalian influenza viruses has occurred in cats, but experts fear that cats might give the virus an opportunity to adapt to mammals. This publication gives a review on avian influenza in cats with a focus on practical aspects for veterinarians.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review on avian influenza A H5N1 infections in cats focusing on epidemiology and clinical signs, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Drosophila RNAi screen identifies host genes important for influenza virus replication.
Abstract: All viruses rely on host cell proteins and their associated mechanisms to complete the viral life cycle. Identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy, but this goal may take several decades to achieve with conventional forward genetic screening methods and mammalian cell cultures. Here we describe a novel genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila that can be used to identify host genes important for influenza virus replication. After modifying influenza virus to allow infection of Drosophila cells and detection of influenza virus gene expression, we tested an RNAi library against 13,071 genes (90% of the Drosophila genome), identifying over 100 for which suppression in Drosophila cells significantly inhibited or stimulated reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) expression from an influenza-virus-derived vector. The relevance of these findings to influenza virus infection of mammalian cells is illustrated for a subset of the Drosophila genes identified; that is, for three implicated Drosophila genes, the corresponding human homologues ATP6V0D1, COX6A1 and NXF1 are shown to have key functions in the replication of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza A viruses, but not vesicular stomatitis virus or vaccinia virus, in human HEK 293 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila to identify previously unrecognized host proteins that are required for influenza virus replication. This could accelerate the development of new classes of antiviral drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment, which are urgently needed given the obstacles to rapid development of an effective vaccine against pandemic influenza and the probable emergence of strains resistant to available drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies host genes important for influenza virus replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: A broad spectrum, one-step reverse-transcription PCR amplification of the neuraminidase gene from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus.
Abstract: The emergence of high pathogenicity strains of Influenza A virus in a variety of human and animal hosts, with wide geographic distribution, has highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus for outbreak management and treatment. Type A virus can be classified into subtypes according to the viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of published primers to subtype neuraminidase genes and describe a new broad spectrum primer pair that can detect all 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers with M13 tags, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13 were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a touchdown protocol with RNA from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing the 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blinded clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also assayed and were mostly of subtype N2. The region amplified was direct sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. The RT-PCR fragment generated includes one of the mutation sites related to oseltamivir resistance, H274Y. Our one-step RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing is a rapid, accurate, and specific method for detection and subtyping of different neuraminidase subtypes from a range of host species and from different geographical locations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a broad-spectrum RT-PCR assay for neuraminidase gene detection and subtyping but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza activity--United States and worldwide, 2007-08 season.
Abstract: During the 2007-08 influenza season, influenza activity peaked in mid-February in the United States and was associated with greater mortality and higher rates of hospitalization of children aged 0-4 years, compared with each of the previous three seasons. In the United States, influenza A (H1N1) was the predominant strain early in the season; influenza A (H3N2) viruses increased in circulation in January and predominated overall. While influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B viruses cocirculated worldwide, influenza A (H1N1) viruses were most commonly reported in Canada, Europe, and Africa, and influenza B viruses were predominant in most Asian countries. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide during the 2007-08 influenza season (September 30, 2007-May 17, 2008).

Title: Hsp90 inhibitors reduce influenza virus replication in cell culture.
Abstract: The viral RNA polymerase complex of influenza A virus consists of three subunits PB1, PB2 and PA. Recently, the cellular chaperone Hsp90 was shown to play a role in nuclear import and assembly of the trimeric polymerase complex by binding to PB1 and PB2. Here we show that Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin or its derivative 17-AAG, delay the growth of influenza virus in cell culture resulting in a 1-2 log reduction in viral titre early in infection. We suggest that this is caused by the reduced half-life of PB1 and PB2 and inhibition of nuclear import of PB1 and PA which lead to reduction in viral RNP assembly. Hsp90 inhibitors may represent a new class of antiviral compounds against influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on influenza virus replication in cell culture but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of neutrophils by influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection of the respiratory tract is characterized by a neutrophil infiltrate accompanied by inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. We and others have reported that Toll-like receptor (TLR) proteins are present on human neutrophils and that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) treatment enhances IL-8 (CXCL8) secretion in response to stimulation with TLR ligands. We demonstrate that influenza virus can induce IL-8 and other inflammatory cytokines from GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils. Using heat inactivation of influenza virus, we show that viral entry but not replication is required for cytokine induction. Furthermore, endosomal acidification and viral uncoating are necessary. Finally, using single-cell analysis of intracellular cytokine accumulation in neutrophils from knockout mice, we prove that TLR7 is essential for influenza viral recognition and inflammatory cytokine production by murine neutrophils. These studies demonstrate neutrophil activation by influenza virus and highlight the importance of TLR7 and TLR8 in that response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host immune response (neutrophil activation via TLRs) to influenza virus infection without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: MDCK-SIAT1 cells show improved isolation rates for recent human influenza viruses compared to conventional MDCK cells.
Abstract: The ability to isolate and propagate influenza virus is an essential tool for the yearly surveillance of circulating virus strains and to ensure accurate clinical diagnosis for appropriate treatment. The suitability of MDCK-SIAT1 cells, engineered to express increased levels of alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, as an alternative to conventional MDCK cells for isolation of circulating influenza virus was assessed. A greater number of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses from stored human clinical specimens collected between 2005 and 2007 were isolated following inoculation in MDCK-SIAT1 cells than in MDCK cells. In addition, a higher titer of virus was recovered following culture in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. All A(H1N1) viruses recovered from MDCK-SIAT1 cells were able to agglutinate both turkey and guinea pig red blood cells (RBC), while half of the A(H3N2) viruses recovered after passage in MDCK-SIAT1 cells lost the ability to agglutinate turkey RBC. Importantly, the HA-1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene was genetically stable after passaging in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, a feature not always seen following MDCK cell or embryonated chicken egg passage of human influenza virus. These data indicate that the MDCK-SIAT1 cell line is superior to conventional MDCK cells for isolation of human influenza virus from clinical specimens and may be used routinely for the isolation and propagation of current human influenza viruses for surveillance, diagnostic, and research purposes.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on cell culture systems for virus isolation and genetic stability during passage, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular characterization of an H1N2 swine influenza virus isolated in Miyazaki, Japan, in 2006.
Abstract: Swine influenza virus (SIV) was isolated from a farm in Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan in July 2006. An isolate was genetically subtyped as H1N2 and was designated A/swine/Miyazaki/1/2006 (H1N2). The nucleotide sequences of all eight viral RNA segments were determined, and then phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method. All segments were shown to be closely related to those of Japanese SIV H1N2 isolates, which have been circulating since the 1980s. The results indicate the persistence of the SIV H1N2 subtype in the Japanese pig population for more than two decades and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance for SIV.

Title: Prevention of avian influenza epidemic: what policy should we choose?
Abstract: Human-to-human transmission of the avian influenza has been extremely rarely reported, and is considered as limited, inefficient and unsustained. However, experts warn an occurrence of "mutant avian influenza", which can easily spread among humans, because the avian influenza is already endemic, in particular in Asian poultry, and it is evolving in domestic and wild birds, pigs and humans. Outbreak of such mutant avian influenza in the human world may have devastating consequences, which are comparable with these for the 1918 "Spanish influenza". In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the spread of the mutant avian influenza, and explore the effectivity of the prevention policies, namely the elimination policy which increases the effective additional death rate of the infected birds and the quarantine policy which reduces the number of infective contacts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops a mathematical model for spread of mutant avian influenza and prevention policies but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Homologous recombination is very rare or absent in human influenza A virus.
Abstract: To determine the extent of homologous recombination in human influenza A virus, we assembled a data set of 13,852 sequences representing all eight segments and both major circulating subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1. Using an exhaustive search and a nonparametric test for mosaic structure, we identified 315 sequences (approximately 2%) in five different RNA segments that, after a multiple-comparison correction, had statistically significant mosaic signals compatible with homologous recombination. Of these, only two contained recombinant regions of sufficient length (>100 nucleotides [nt]) that the occurrence of homologous recombination could be verified using phylogenetic methods, with the rest involving very short sequence regions (15 to 30 nt). Although this secondary analysis revealed patterns of phylogenetic incongruence compatible with the action of recombination, neither candidate recombinant was strongly supported. Given our inability to exclude the occurrence of mixed infection and template switching during amplification, laboratory artifacts provide an alternative and likely explanation for the occurrence of phylogenetic incongruence in these two cases. We therefore conclude that, if it occurs at all, homologous recombination plays only a very minor role in the evolution of human influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates homologous recombination in influenza A virus sequences but does not link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Comparative phyloinformatics of virus genes at micro and macro levels in a distributed computing environment.
Abstract: Preparedness for a possible global pandemic caused by viruses such as the highly pathogenic influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for large-scale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed--a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area. In this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented. In particular, we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment. As a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates (micro level) and influenza viruses (macro level). The results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution. The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing. In particular, the utility of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown. Secondly, the analysis of the utilized H5N1 neuraminidase datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.

Title: Influenza virus and proteolytic bacteria co-infection in respiratory tract from individuals presenting respiratory manifestations.
Abstract: A role for proteolytic bacteria in the exacerbation of influenza virus has been shown in natural hosts such as pigs and humans. Four hundred seven samples were collected from the respiratory tract of individuals presenting clinical manifestations, during influenza season (2003-2005) in São Paulo City. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of determined bacteria co-infecting virus in human respiratory tract. Tests, such as bacteriological, immunofluorescence (IF), RT/PCR and hemagglutination (HA) were used for bacterial and viral investigation. Thirty seven (9.09%) positive for influenza virus were screened by IF. The RT/PCR confirmed the presence of influenza virus in these samples. Bacterial and agar casein tests demonstrated that 18 (48.64%) individuals were infected with proteolytic bacteria such as Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Among these samples, 13 (35.13%) were co-infected with influenza A virus. Influenza type B, co-infecting bacteria were found in five (13.51%) samples. In vitro the S. aureus protease increased the influenza HA titer after contact for 30 min at 25 masculineC. Results revealed the occurrence of co-infection with proteolytic bacteria and influenza in the evaluated individuals. This finding corroborates that virus versus bacteria synergism could be able to potentiate respiratory infection, increasing damage to hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports co-infection of influenza virus with proteolytic bacteria and potential synergistic effects but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Examining the hemagglutinin subtype diversity among wild duck-origin influenza A viruses using ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs and a novel RT-PCR method.
Abstract: This study presents an interconnected approach for circumventing two inherent limitations associated with studies defining the natural history of influenza A viruses in wild birds. The first limiting factor is the ability to maintain a cold chain from specimen collection to the laboratory when study sites are in more remote locations. The second limiting factor is the ability to identify all influenza A virus HA subtypes present in an original sample. We report a novel method for molecular subtyping of avian influenza A virus hemagglutinin genes using degenerate primers designed to amplify all known hemagglutinin subtypes. It was shown previously that templates larger than 200 bp were not consistently amplifiable from ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs. For this study, new primer sets were designed within these constraints. This method was used to perform subtyping RT-PCR on 191 influenza RNA-positive ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs obtained from 880 wild ducks in central Alaska in 2005. Seven different co-circulating hemagglutinin subtypes were identified in this study set, including H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8, and H12. In addition, 16% of original cloacal samples showed evidence of mixed infection, with samples yielding from two-to-five different hemagglutinin subtypes. This study further demonstrates the complex ecobiology of avian influenza A viruses in wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study develops a method for detecting hemagglutinin subtypes in wild duck influenza viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Orthomyxo-, paramyxo- and flavivirus infections in wild waterfowl in Finland.
Abstract: Screening wild birds for viral pathogens has become increasingly important. We tested a screening approach based on blood and cloacal and tracheal swabs collected by hunters to study the prevalence of influenza A, paramyxo-, flavi-, and alphaviruses in Finnish wild waterfowl, which has been previously unknown. We studied 310 blood samples and 115 mixed tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from hunted waterfowl in 2006. Samples were screened by RT-PCR and serologically by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for influenza A (FLUAV), type 1 avian paramyxo-(APMV-1), Sindbis (SINV), West Nile (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) virus infections. FLUAV RNA was found in 13 tracheal/cloacal swabs and seven strains were isolated. Five blood samples were antibody positive. Six APMV-1 RNA-positive samples were found from which four strains were isolated, while two blood samples were antibody positive. None of the birds were positive for flavivirus RNA but three birds had flavivirus antibodies by HI test. No antibodies to SINV were detected. We conclude that circulation of both influenza A virus and avian paramyxovirus-1 in Finnish wild waterfowl was documented. The FLUAV and APMV-1 prevalences in wild waterfowl were 11.3% and 5.2% respectively, by this study. The subtype H3N8 was the only detected FLUAV subtype while APMV-1 strains clustered into two distinct lineages. Notably, antibodies to a likely mosquito-borne flavivirus were detected in three samples. The screening approach based on hunted waterfowl seemed reliable for monitoring FLUAV and APMV by RT-PCR from cloacal or tracheal samples, but antibody testing in this format seemed to be of low sensitivity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study screens wild waterfowl for various viral infections but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and antibody responses against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in mice by inoculation of apathogenic H5N1 influenza virus particles inactivated with formalin.
Abstract: We investigated whether a vaccine derived from an apathogenic reassortant type A H5N1 influenza strain could induce immune responses in vivo that mediated protection from highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in mice. After two subcutaneous immunizations with formalin-inactivated H5N1 whole virus particles (whole particle vaccine), significant killing specific for cells presenting a nucleoprotein peptide from the vaccine strain of the virus was observed. Similar vaccination with viruses treated with ether and formalin, which are commonly used for humans as ether-split vaccines, induced little or no cytotoxic T-cell response. Furthermore, whole particle vaccines of the apathogenic H5N1 strain were more effective than ether-split vaccines at inducing antibody production able to neutralize a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. Finally, whole particle vaccines of H5N1 protected mice against infection by an H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus more effectively than did ether-split vaccines. These results suggest that formalin-inactivated virus particles of apathogenic strains are effective for induction of both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and antibody responses against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in vivo, resulting in protection from infection by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on immune responses induced by vaccination with apathogenic H5N1 virus particles and protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Novel druggable hot spots in avian influenza neuraminidase H5N1 revealed by computational solvent mapping of a reduced and representative receptor ensemble.
Abstract: The influenza virus subtype H5N1 has raised concerns of a possible human pandemic threat because of its high virulence and mutation rate. Although several approved anti-influenza drugs effectively target the neuraminidase, some strains have already acquired resistance to the currently available anti-influenza drugs. In this study, we present the synergistic application of extended explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) and computational solvent mapping (CS-Map) to identify putative 'hot spots' within flexible binding regions of N1 neuraminidase. Using representative conformations of the N1 binding region extracted from a clustering analysis of four concatenated 40-ns MD simulations, CS-Map was utilized to assess the ability of small, solvent-sized molecules to bind within close proximity to the sialic acid binding region. Mapping analyses of the dominant MD conformations reveal the presence of additional hot spot regions in the 150- and 430-loop regions. Our hot spot analysis provides further support for the feasibility of developing high-affinity inhibitors capable of binding these regions, which appear to be unique to the N1 strain.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies druggable hot spots in neuraminidase of H5N1 using computational methods, focusing on structural features rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Epidemiologic characterization of the 1918 influenza pandemic summer wave in Copenhagen: implications for pandemic control strategies.
Abstract: The 1918-1919 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic killed approximately 50 million people worldwide. Historical records suggest that an early pandemic wave struck Europe during the summer of 1918. We obtained surveillance data that were compiled weekly, during 1910-1919, in Copenhagen, Denmark; the records included medically treated influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), hospitalizations, and deaths by age. We used a Serfling seasonal regression model to quantify excess morbidity and mortality, and we estimated the reproductive number (R) for the summer, fall, and winter pandemic waves. A large epidemic occurred in Copenhagen during the summer of 1918; the age distribution of deaths was characteristic of the 1918-1919 A/H1N1 pandemic overall. That summer wave accounted for 29%-34% of all excess ILIs and hospitalizations during 1918, whereas the case-fatality rate (0.3%) was many-fold lower than that of the fall wave (2.3%). Similar patterns were observed in 3 other Scandinavian cities. R was substantially higher in summer (2.0-5.4) than in fall (1.2-1.6) in all cities. The Copenhagen summer wave may have been caused by a precursor A/H1N1 pandemic virus that transmitted efficiently but lacked extreme virulence. The R measured in the summer wave is likely a better approximation of transmissibility in a fully susceptible population and is substantially higher than that found in previous US studies. The summer wave may have provided partial protection against the lethal fall wave.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is an epidemiologic characterization of the 1918 influenza pandemic wave, focusing on transmission and mortality data without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: What the paediatrician needs to know when pandemic influenza arrives in clinical practice.
Abstract: Avian (H5N1) influenza or “bird ‘flu” has received considerable attention in both the medical literature and the mass media in the last few years. Despite the tabloids’ portrayal of an imminent threat, to date there have been relatively few cases in humans in spite of large numbers of infected poultry (Hien et al. 2004). However, this may be falsely reassuring. Most indications suggest that it is just a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs (Osterholm 2005). In the words of the UK Chief Medical Officer: “most experts believe that it is not a question of whether there will be another severe influenza pandemic but when” (Department of Health 2005). Although experts are agreed that a future influenza pandemic is almost inevitable, its timing is unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the virus responsible will be H5N1 or another, novel, influenza strain (Osterholm 2005). A recent editorial described avian influenza as a “predicament of extraordinary proportions” (Anonymous 2006). The next influenza pandemic will have a dramatic impact on all levels of health care including the everyday work of doctors. This chapter focuses on the clinical aspects of pandemic influenza about which paediatricians need to be familiar.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical review focusing on pediatric considerations for pandemic influenza, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: [Influenza virus].
Abstract: Every year, especially during the cold season, many people catch an acute respiratory disease, namely flu. It is easy to catch this disease; therefore, it spreads very rapidly and often becomes an epidemic or a global pandemic. Airway inflammation and other body ailments, which form in a very short period, torment the patient several weeks. After that, the symptoms of the disease usually disappear as quickly as they emerged. The great epidemics of flu have rather unique characteristics; therefore, it is possible to identify descriptions of such epidemics in historic sources. Already in the 4th century bc, Hippocrates himself wrote about one of them. It is known now that flu epidemics emerge rather frequently, but there are no regular intervals between those events. The epidemics can differ in their consequences, but usually they cause an increased mortality of elderly people. The great flu epidemics of the last century took millions of human lives. In 1918-19, during "The Spanish" pandemic of flu, there were around 40-50 millions of deaths all over the world; "Pandemic of Asia" in 1957 took up to one million lives, etc. Influenza virus can cause various disorders of the respiratory system: from mild inflammations of upper airways to acute pneumonia that finally results in the patient's death. Scientist Richard E. Shope, who investigated swine flu in 1920, had a suspicion that the cause of this disease might be a virus. Already in 1933, scientists from the National Institute for Medical Research in London - Wilson Smith, Sir Christopher Andrewes, and Sir Patrick Laidlaw - for the first time isolated the virus, which caused human flu. Then scientific community started the exhaustive research of influenza virus, and the great interest in this virus and its unique features is still active even today.

Title: Human respiratory syncytial virus and other viral infections in infants receiving palivizumab.
Abstract: Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that prevents severe human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infections. We determined the etiology of respiratory viral infections in palivizumab recipients, and monitored the clinical outcome and HRSV genotype in HRSV-infected infants. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children receiving palivizumab who consulted or were hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) during the 2004-2005 season. Viral cultures and multiplex RT-PCR for influenza A/B, HRSV and human metapneumovirus were performed. The fusion (F) gene of HRSV amplicons was also sequenced. Among 116 enrolled patients, 51 (44%) had > or = 1 episode of ARTI for a total of 93 visits. At least one virus was identified in 33 (36%) of the 93 NPA samples; HRSV accounted for 11 (33%) of confirmed viral etiologies. Compared to subjects who had other viral ARTI, HRSV-positive subjects had less fever (p=0.01) and tended to have more bronchiolitis (p=0.07). Ten subjects (11 visits) developed HRSV infection, although only one was hospitalized. HRSV was detected after a median of 5.5 palivizumab doses and a median of 14 days after the last dose. One of the 11 HRSV strains tested had a F mutation located in the palivizumab-binding site. HRSV is still a major cause of ARTI in children receiving palivizumab, although the outcome of infected children appears mild.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on viral infections in infants receiving palivizumab and clinical outcomes, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Preparation of armored RNA as a control for multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR detection of influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
Abstract: The common respiratory viruses, including influenza A, influenza B, and newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, may cause similar clinical symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis of these virus pathogens is frequently required for single clinical samples. In addition, there is an urgent need for noninfectious and stable RNA standards and controls for multivirus detection. In this study, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting of the RNAs of influenza A and influenza B viruses and SARS coronavirus was performed, and the resulting products were spliced into a fragment which was packaged into armored RNA for use as a noninfectious, quantifiable synthetic substitute. Furthermore, in the present study we developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay in which the armored RNA was used as an external positive control and the three RNA viruses could be detected simultaneously in a single reaction mix. The detection limit of the multiplex real-time PCR was 10 copies/microl of armored RNA.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes the preparation of armored RNA controls for PCR detection of viruses, focusing on diagnostic methods rather than genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: DR5 activation of caspase-8 induces DC maturation and immune enhancement in vivo.
Abstract: Non-homeostatic tissue apoptosis in vivo has been shown to induce inflammatory responses and facilitate the cross-presentation of proteins within apoptotic bodies. We hypothesize that in the presence of foreign antigens, the apoptotic-inflammatory process improves immune priming; further, molecules that trigger apoptosis may be adapted for use as immune adjuvants. One very attractive molecule in this context is the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family molecule DR5/TRAIL-receptor 2. We show a significant improvement in CD8(+) T-cell mediated vaccine immunity with the use of death receptor-5 (DR5) as an immune adjuvant, a property that is correlated with the activation of caspases-8 (casp8) and dependent on its ability to induce apoptosis in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates DR5 activation and immune enhancement in vivo, focusing on host immune mechanisms rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Influenza virus and redox mediated cell signaling: a complex network of virus/host interaction.
Abstract: Several viruses, including influenza, induce an imbalance of intracellular redox state toward pro-oxidant conditions. Through different mechanisms these alterations contribute both to influenza virus replication and to the pathogenesis of virus-induced disease. At the same time, influenza virus activates several intracellular signaling pathways involved in important physiological functions of the cell. Interestingly, many of these pathways are finely regulated by small changes in intracellular redox state, and the virus-induced redox imbalance might also control viral replication through this mechanism. Here we review the main intracellular redox-sensitive pathways activated upon influenza infection and involved in regulating viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses influenza virus-induced redox changes and signaling pathways but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The oligomeric state of the active BM2 ion channel protein of influenza B virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus and influenza B virus particles both contain small integral membrane proteins (A/M2 and BM2, respectively) that function as a pH-sensitive proton channel and are essential for virus replication. The mechanism of action of the M2 channels is a subject of scientific interest particularly as A/M2 channel was shown to be a target for the action of the antiviral drug amantadine. Unfortunately, an inhibitor of the BM2 channel activity is not known. Thus, knowledge of the structural and functional properties of the BM2 channel is essential for the development of potent antiviral drugs. The characterization of the oligomeric state of the BM2 channel is an essential first step in the understanding of channel function. Here we describe determination of the stoichiometry of the BM2 proton channel by utilizing three different approaches. 1) We demonstrated that BM2 monomers can be chemically cross-linked to yield species consistent with dimers, trimers, and tetramers. 2) We studied electrophysiological and biochemical properties of mixed oligomers consisting of wild-type and mutated BM2 subunits and related these data to predicted binomial distribution models. 3) We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in combination with biochemical measurements to estimate the relationships between BM2 channel subunits expressed in the plasma membrane. Our experimental data are consistent with a tetrameric structure of the BM2 channel. Finally, we demonstrated that BM2 transmembrane domain is responsible for the channel oligomerization.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the oligomeric state of the BM2 ion channel protein and its structural characterization without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza: assessing the danger of its generation and spread.
Abstract: Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve the results.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models resistance emergence and spread using epidemiological and mathematical data but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionarily conserved protein sequences of influenza a viruses, avian and human, as vaccine targets.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses generate an extreme genetic diversity through point mutation and gene segment exchange, resulting in many new strains that emerge from the animal reservoirs, among which was the recent highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. This genetic diversity also endows these viruses with a dynamic adaptability to their habitats, one result being the rapid selection of genomic variants that resist the immune responses of infected hosts. With the possibility of an influenza A pandemic, a critical need is a vaccine that will recognize and protect against any influenza A pathogen. One feasible approach is a vaccine containing conserved immunogenic protein sequences that represent the genotypic diversity of all current and future avian and human influenza viruses as an alternative to current vaccines that address only the known circulating virus strains. Methodologies for large-scale analysis of the evolutionary variability of the influenza A virus proteins recorded in public databases were developed and used to elucidate the amino acid sequence diversity and conservation of 36,343 sequences of the 11 viral proteins of the recorded virus isolates of the past 30 years. Technologies were also applied to identify the conserved amino acid sequences from isolates of the past decade, and to evaluate the predicted human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted class I and II T-cell epitopes of the conserved sequences. Fifty-five (55) sequences of 9 or more amino acids of the polymerases (PB2, PB1, and PA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix 1 (M1) proteins were completely conserved in at least 80%, many in 95 to 100%, of the avian and human influenza A virus isolates despite the marked evolutionary variability of the viruses. Almost all (50) of these conserved sequences contained putative supertype HLA class I or class II epitopes as predicted by 4 peptide-HLA binding algorithms. Additionally, data of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) include 29 experimentally identified HLA class I and II T-cell epitopes present in 14 of the conserved sequences. This study of all reported influenza A virus protein sequences, avian and human, has identified 55 highly conserved sequences, most of which are predicted to have immune relevance as T-cell epitopes. This is a necessary first step in the design and analysis of a polyepitope, pan-influenza A vaccine. In addition to the application described herein, these technologies can be applied to other pathogens and to other therapeutic modalities designed to attack DNA, RNA, or protein sequences critical to pathogen function.

Title: Influenza A virus PB1-F2: a small protein with a big punch.
Abstract: Virulence factors, such as the recently discovered PB1-F2, contribute to the pathogenesis and comorbidity of influenza A virus. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, McAuley et al. characterize the role of PB1-F2, including in the pandemic 1918 virus, in causing increased lung pathology and fatal pneumococcus infection in mice. This work sheds light on the mechanisms of pathogenicity during influenza A virus infections.

Title: Barriers to antigenic escape by pathogens: trade-off between reproductive rate and antigenic mutability.
Abstract: A single measles vaccination provides lifelong protection. No antigenic variants that escape immunity have been observed. By contrast, influenza continually evolves new antigenic variants, and the vaccine has to be updated frequently with new strains. Both measles and influenza are RNA viruses with high mutation rates, so the mutation rate alone cannot explain the differences in antigenic variability. We develop a new hypothesis to explain antigenic stasis versus change. We first note that the antigenically static viruses tend to have high reproductive rates and to concentrate infection in children, whereas antigenically variable viruses such as influenza tend to spread more widely across age classes. We argue that, for pathogens in a naive host population that spread more rapidly in younger individuals than in older individuals, natural selection weights more heavily a rise in reproductive rate. By contrast, pathogens that spread more readily among older individuals gain more by antigenic escape, so natural selection weights more heavily antigenic mutability. These divergent selective pressures on reproductive rate and antigenic mutability may explain some of the observed differences between pathogens in age-class bias, reproductive rate, and antigenic variation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a theoretical hypothesis on pathogen evolution and antigenic mutability without explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Influenza in migratory birds and evidence of limited intercontinental virus exchange.
Abstract: Migratory waterfowl of the world are the natural reservoirs of influenza viruses of all known subtypes. However, it is unknown whether these waterfowl perpetuate highly pathogenic (HP) H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. Here we report influenza virus surveillance from 2001 to 2006 in wild ducks in Alberta, Canada, and in shorebirds and gulls at Delaware Bay (New Jersey), United States, and examine the frequency of exchange of influenza viruses between the Eurasian and American virus clades, or superfamilies. Influenza viruses belonging to each of the subtypes H1 through H13 and N1 through N9 were detected in these waterfowl, but H14 and H15 were not found. Viruses of the HP Asian H5N1 subtypes were not detected, and serologic studies in adult mallard ducks provided no evidence of their circulation. The recently described H16 subtype of influenza viruses was detected in American shorebirds and gulls but not in ducks. We also found an unusual cluster of H7N3 influenza viruses in shorebirds and gulls that was able to replicate well in chickens and kill chicken embryos. Genetic analysis of 6,767 avian influenza gene segments and 248 complete avian influenza viruses supported the notion that the exchange of entire influenza viruses between the Eurasian and American clades does not occur frequently. Overall, the available evidence does not support the perpetuation of HP H5N1 influenza in migratory birds and suggests that the introduction of HP Asian H5N1 to the Americas by migratory birds is likely to be a rare event.

Reason: The study surveys influenza virus subtypes in migratory birds and their geographic distribution but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prediction of mutations engineered by randomness in H5N1 hemagglutinins of influenza A virus.
Abstract: This is the continuation of our studies on the prediction of mutation engineered by randomness in proteins from influenza A virus. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that randomness plays a role in engineering mutations because the measures of randomness in protein are different before and after mutations. Thus we built a cause-mutation relationship to count the mutation engineered by randomness, and conducted several concept-initiated studies to predict the mutations in proteins from influenza A virus, which demonstrated the possibility of prediction of mutations along this line of thought. On the other hand, these concept-initiated studies indicate the directions forwards the enhancement of predictability, of which we need to use the neural network instead of logistic regression that was used in those concept-initiated studies to enhance the predictability. In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to apply the neural network to modeling the cause-mutation relationship to predict the possible mutation positions, and then we use the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids at predicted positions. The results confirm the possibility of use of internal cause-mutation relationship with neural network model to predict the mutation positions and use of amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids.

Title: BioHealthBase: informatics support in the elucidation of influenza virus host pathogen interactions and virulence.
Abstract: The BioHealthBase Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) (http://www.biohealthbase.org) is a public bioinformatics database and analysis resource for the study of specific biodefense and public health pathogens-Influenza virus, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Microsporidia species and ricin toxin. The BioHealthBase serves as an extensive integrated repository of data imported from public databases, data derived from various computational algorithms and information curated from the scientific literature. The goal of the BioHealthBase is to facilitate the development of therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines by integrating all available data in the context of host-pathogen interactions, thus allowing researchers to understand the root causes of virulence and pathogenicity. Genome and protein annotations can be viewed either as formatted text or graphically through a genome browser. 3D visualization capabilities allow researchers to view proteins with key structural and functional features highlighted. Influenza virus host-pathogen interactions at the molecular/cellular and systemic levels are represented. Host immune response to influenza infection is conveyed through the display of experimentally determined antibody and T-cell epitopes curated from the scientific literature or as derived from computational predictions. At the molecular/cellular level, the BioHealthBase BRC has developed biological pathway representations relevant to influenza virus host-pathogen interaction in collaboration with the Reactome database (http://www.reactome.org).

Title: Cloning of the canine RNA polymerase I promoter and establishment of reverse genetics for influenza A and B in MDCK cells.
Abstract: Recent incidents where highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 viruses have spread from avian species into humans have prompted the development of cell-based production of influenza vaccines as an alternative to or replacement of current egg-based production. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are the primary cell-substrate candidate for influenza virus production but an efficient system for the direct rescue of influenza virus from cloned influenza cDNAs in MDCK cells did not exist. The objective of this study was to develop a highly efficient method for direct rescue of influenza virus in MDCK cells. The eight-plasmid DNA transfection system for the rescue of influenza virus from cloned influenza cDNAs was adapted such that virus can be generated directly from MDCK cells. This was accomplished by cloning the canine RNA polymerase I (pol I) promoter from MDCK cells and exchanging it for the human RNA pol I promoter in the eight plasmid rescue system. The adapted system retains bi-directional transcription of the viral cDNA template into both RNA pol I transcribed negative-sense viral RNA and RNA pol II transcribed positive-sense viral mRNA. The utility of this system was demonstrated by rescue in MDCK cells of 6:2 genetic reassortants composed of the six internal gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M and NS) from either the cold-adapted (ca) influenza A vaccine strain (ca A/Ann Arbor/1/60) or the ca influenza B vaccine strain (ca B/Ann Arbor/1/66) and HA and NA gene segments from wild type influenza A and B strains. Representative 6:2 reassortants were generated for influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H6N1, H7N3 and H9N2) and for both the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B. The yield of infectious virus in the supernatant of transfected MDCK cells was 106 to 107 plaque forming units per ml by 5 to 7 days post-transfection. This rescue system will enable efficient production of both influenza A and influenza B vaccines exclusively in MDCK cells and therefore provides a tool for influenza pandemic preparedness.

Title: Ecologic immunology of avian influenza (H5N1) in migratory birds.
Abstract: The claim that migratory birds are responsible for the long-distance spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 rests on the assumption that infected wild birds can remain asymptomatic and migrate long distances unhampered. We critically assess this claim from the perspective of ecologic immunology, a research field that analyzes immune function in an ecologic, physiologic, and evolutionary context. Long-distance migration is one of the most demanding activities in the animal world. We show that several studies demonstrate that such prolonged, intense exercise leads to immunosuppression and that migratory performance is negatively affected by infections. These findings make it unlikely that wild birds can spread the virus along established long-distance migration pathways. However, infected, symptomatic wild birds may act as vectors over shorter distances, as appears to have occurred in Europe in early 2006.

Reason: The paper discusses ecological immunology and migratory bird behavior related to H5N1 spread but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis reveals the global migration of seasonal influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The winter seasonality of influenza A virus in temperate climates is one of the most widely recognized, yet least understood, epidemiological patterns in infectious disease. Central to understanding what drives the seasonal emergence of this important human pathogen is determining what becomes of the virus during the non-epidemic summer months. Herein, we take a step towards elucidating the seasonal emergence of influenza virus by determining the evolutionary relationship between populations of influenza A virus sampled from opposite hemispheres. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 487 complete genomes of human influenza A/H3N2 viruses collected between 1999 and 2005 from Australia and New Zealand in the southern hemisphere, and a representative sub-sample of viral genome sequences from 413 isolates collected in New York state, United States, representing the northern hemisphere. We show that even in areas as relatively geographically isolated as New Zealand's South Island and Western Australia, global viral migration contributes significantly to the seasonal emergence of influenza A epidemics, and that this migration has no clear directional pattern. These observations run counter to suggestions that local epidemics are triggered by the climate-driven reactivation of influenza viruses that remain latent within hosts between seasons or transmit at low efficiency between seasons. However, a complete understanding of the seasonal movements of influenza A virus will require greatly expanded global surveillance, particularly of tropical regions where the virus circulates year-round, and during non-epidemic periods in temperate climate areas.

Title: Development and evaluation of an Influenza virus subtype H7N2 vaccine candidate for pandemic preparedness.
Abstract: Influenza virus of the H7N2 subtype has been introduced into noncommercial poultry in the United States, and this probably resulted in incidents of transmission of H7N2 virus to humans, documented in 2002 and 2003. This virus could be considered a potential threat to public health if it acquired person-to-person transmissibility. A favored approach for global pandemic preparedness includes development of prepandemic vaccines for any potential pandemic virus. To this end, we created a high-growth reassortant virus (H7N2-PR8) containing the genes for the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase from a low-pathogenicity (H7N2) virus strain and the remaining six genes from a human vaccine strain (H1N1). The reassortant strain was evaluated to assess its antigenicity, safety, and protective efficacy using a mouse model. Antigenicity studies using ferret antibodies raised against H7N2-PR8 indicated that this virus confers broad cross-reactivity with divergent H7 viruses of different years and lineages. Mice and chickens inoculated with high doses of H7N2-PR8 supported virus replication but survived, indicating that this virus is comparable to other avian viruses of low pathogenicity. To assess the protective efficacy of H7N2-PR8, mice were immunized with two doses of formalin-inactivated H7N2-PR8, alone or with alum. Vaccinated mice subsequently challenged with highly pathogenic viruses from homologous and heterologous lineages A/Canada/444/04 (H7N3) and A/Netherlands/219/03 (H7N7) showed pronounced reduction of wild-type virus replication. These studies indicate that H7N2-PR8 is immunogenic, safe, and protective in animal models; these are the essential attributes to qualify for phase I human clinical trials as a prepandemic vaccine.

Title: Influenza viruses and the evolution of avian influenza virus H5N1.
Abstract: Although small in size and simple in structure, influenza viruses are sophisticated organisms with highly mutagenic genomes and wide antigenic diversity. They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H5N1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead to the emergence of a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50% versus 2.5%), which killed 675000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide. While the clock is still ticking towards what seems to be inevitable pandemic influenza, on April 17, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against the avian influenza virus H5N1 for humans at high risk. However, more research is needed to develop a more effective and affordable vaccine that can be given at lower doses.

Title: Antiviral oseltamivir is not removed or degraded in normal sewage water treatment: implications for development of resistance by influenza A virus.
Abstract: Oseltamivir is the main antiviral for treatment and prevention of pandemic influenza. The increase in oseltamivir resistance reported recently has therefore sparked a debate on how to use oseltamivir in non pandemic influenza and the risks associated with wide spread use during a pandemic. Several questions have been asked about the fate of oseltamivir in the sewage treatment plants and in the environment. We have assessed the fate of oseltamivir and discuss the implications of environmental residues of oseltamivir regarding the occurrence of resistance. A series of batch experiments that simulated normal sewage treatment with oseltamivir present was conducted and the UV-spectra of oseltamivir were recorded. Our experiments show that the active moiety of oseltamivir is not removed in normal sewage water treatments and is not degraded substantially by UV light radiation, and that the active substance is released in waste water leaving the plant. Our conclusion is that a ubiquitous use of oseltamivir may result in selection pressures in the environment that favor development of drug-resistance.

Truncation and alanine substitution experiments showed that mAb61A5 recognized the NP fragment with residues 17 to 123 in which a conformational epitope formed by the beta1 sheet and the linker region between the alpha1 and alpha2 helices. Variations in the epitope or nearby can partly account for the poor mAb61A5 reactivity with the NP of A/Aichi/2/68 or A/duck/Pennsylvania/10128/84 strains. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that mAb61A5 preferentially interacted with viral ribonucleoprotein complexes, composed of RNA polymerase, negative/positive sense RNA and NP, rather than exogenously added NP. Immunofluorescence microscopy using mAb61A5 showed a punctate staining in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. The punctate NPs accumulated at the microtubule organizing center and co-localized with microtubules. The treatment with leptomycin B to block a CRM1-dependent nuclear export failed to produce the punctate NP. The treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, showed random distribution of the punctate NP in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that microtubule networks, although were not required for the formation of punctate structures, were responsible for the polarized distribution of the punctate NP antigens, most likely viral progeny ribonucleoprotein complexes.

Reason: The paper describes visualization of viral ribonucleoprotein transport but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: [Human and avian influenza due to the H5N1 virus].
Abstract: Recent alerts about "avian influenza", more often referred to by veterinarians as "fowl plague" and by the public as "bird flu", and about its transmission to humans, have received extensive media coverage. Physicians need further information about this development. We begin by looking at several fundamental aspects of influenza virus structure and its various types and subtypes and then review the various avian and human influenza epidemics throughout history. A description follows of the current avian influenza, its history, its presence in migratory and domestic birds, and its clinical aspects. Transmission to humans is covered next: the facts, conditions, human cases, and consumption of poultry meat. Then we consider treatment: none in animal diseases, and very limited for human disease. Vaccination has previously been dealt with and will be barely touched upon here. Finally we will present the guidelines and measures taken both nationally and internationally. Our conclusion is intended to be relatively optimistic, stressing the species barrier and the multiplicity of pathogenic avian viruses recently encountered in humans. We insist on the need to contain the epizootic, if necessary by animal vaccination, to diminish the likelihood of human contamination.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a general review of human and avian influenza due to H5N1 without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Lipid raft disruption by cholesterol depletion enhances influenza A virus budding from MDCK cells.
Abstract: Lipid rafts play critical roles in many aspects of the influenza A virus life cycle. Cholesterol is a critical structural component of lipid rafts, and depletion of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid raft microdomains. In this study, we have investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) treatment on influenza virus budding. When virus-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were treated with MbetaCD at the late phase of infection for a short duration, budding of virus particles, as determined by protein analysis and electron microscopy, increased with increasing concentrations and lengths of treatment. However, infectious virus yield varied, depending on the concentration and duration of MbetaCD treatment. Low concentrations of MbetaCD increased infectious virus yield throughout the treatment period, but higher concentrations caused an initial increase of infectious virus titer followed by a decrease with a longer duration. Relative infectivity of the released virus particles, on the other hand, decreased with increasing concentrations and durations of MbetaCD treatment. Loss of infectivity of virus particles is due to multiple effects of MbetaCD-mediated cholesterol depletion causing disruption of lipid rafts, changes in structural integrity of the viral membrane, leakage of viral proteins, a nick or hole on the viral envelope, and disruption of the virus structure. Exogenous cholesterol increased lipid raft integrity, inhibited particle release, and partially restored the infectivity of the released virus particles. These data show that disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion caused an enhancement of virus particle release from infected cells and a decrease in the infectivity of virus particles.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates effects of cholesterol depletion on virus budding and infectivity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Use of functional genomics to understand influenza-host interactions.
Abstract: Infection with influenza typically results in mild-to-moderate illness in healthy individuals; however, it is responsible for 30,000-40,000 deaths each year in the United States. In extreme cases, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918, tens of millions of people have died from the infection. To prepare for future influenza outbreaks, it is necessary to understand how the virus interacts with the host and to determine what makes certain strains of influenza highly pathogenic. Functional genomics provides a unique approach to this effort by allowing researchers to examine the effect of influenza infection on global host mRNA levels. Researchers are making increasing use of this approach to study virus-host interactions using a variety of model systems. For example, data obtained using microarray technology, in combination with mouse and macaque infection models, is providing exciting new insights into the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the lethality associated with this virus is in part due to an aberrant and unchecked immune response. Progress is also being made toward using functional genomics in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute lung infections and in the development of more effective influenza vaccines and antivirals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews functional genomics approaches to influenza-host interactions but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prediction of mutations engineered by randomness in H5N1 neuraminidases from influenza A virus.
Abstract: In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to determine whether the cause-mutation relationship defined by randomness is protein dependent by predicting mutations in H5N1 neuraminidases from influenza A virus, because we have recently conducted several concept-initiated studies on the prediction of mutations in hemagglutinins from influenza A virus. In our concept-initiated studies, we defined the randomness as a cause for mutation, upon which we built a cause-mutation relationship, which is then switched into the classification problem because the occurrence and non-occurrence of mutations can be classified as unity and zero. Thereafter, we used the logistic regression and neural network to solve this classification problem to predict the mutation positions in hemagglutinins, and then used the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids. As the previous results were promising, we extend this approach to other proteins, such as H5N1 neuraminidase in this study, and further address various issues raised during the development of this approach. The result of this study confirms that we can use this cause-mutation relationship to predict the mutations in H5N1 neuraminidases.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on predicting mutations in H5N1 neuraminidases using computational models, without explicit linking of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: On state-space reduction in multi-strain pathogen models, with an application to antigenic drift in influenza A.
Abstract: Many pathogens exist in phenotypically distinct strains that interact with each other through competition for hosts. General models that describe such multi-strain systems are extremely difficult to analyze because their state spaces are enormously large. Reduced models have been proposed, but so far all of them necessarily allow for coinfections and require that immunity be mediated solely by reduced infectivity, a potentially problematic assumption. Here, we suggest a new state-space reduction approach that allows immunity to be mediated by either reduced infectivity or reduced susceptibility and that can naturally be used for models with or without coinfections. Our approach utilizes the general framework of status-based models. The cornerstone of our method is the introduction of immunity variables, which describe multi-strain systems more naturally than the traditional tracking of susceptible and infected hosts. Models expressed in this way can be approximated in a natural way by a truncation method that is akin to moment closure, allowing us to sharply reduce the size of the state space, and thus to consider models with many strains in a tractable manner. Applying our method to the phenomenon of antigenic drift in influenza A, we propose a potentially general mechanism that could constrain viral evolution to a one-dimensional manifold in a two-dimensional trait space. Our framework broadens the class of multi-strain systems that can be adequately described by reduced models. It permits computational, and even analytical, investigation and thus serves as a useful tool for understanding the evolution and ecology of multi-strain pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a theoretical modeling study on multi-strain pathogen dynamics and antigenic drift, without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The effect of population structure on the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics.
Abstract: The spread of H5N1 avian influenza and the recent high numbers of confirmed human cases have raised international concern about the possibility of a new pandemic. Therefore, antiviral drugs are now being stockpiled to be used as a first line of defence. The large-scale use of antivirals will however exert a strong selection pressure on the virus, and may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A few mathematical models have been developed to assess the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics. These models, however, neglected the spatial structure of large populations and the stochasticity of epidemic and demographic processes. To assess the impact of population structure and stochasticity, we modify and extend a previous model of influenza epidemics into a metapopulation model which takes into account the division of large populations into smaller units, and develop deterministic and stochastic versions of the model. We find that the dynamics in a fragmented population is less explosive, and, as a result, prophylaxis will prevent more infections and lead to fewer resistant cases in both the deterministic and stochastic model. While in the deterministic model the final level of resistance during treatment is not affected by fragmentation, in the stochastic model it is. Our results enable us to qualitatively extrapolate the prediction of deterministic, homogeneous-mixing models to more realistic scenarios.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study on the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics, without direct experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Genetic characterization of HPAI (H5N1) viruses from poultry and wild vultures, Burkina Faso.
Abstract: Genetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) viruses from poultry and hooded vultures in Burkina Faso shows that these viruses belong to 1 of 3 sublineages initially found in Nigeria and later in other African countries. Hooded vultures could potentially be vectors or sentinels of influenza subtype H5N1, as are cats and swans elsewhere.

Title: Genome analysis linking recent European and African influenza (H5N1) viruses.
Abstract: To better understand the ecology and epidemiology of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in its transcontinental spread, we sequenced and analyzed the complete genomes of 36 recent influenza A (H5N1) viruses collected from birds in Europe, northern Africa, and southeastern Asia. These sequences, among the first complete genomes of influenza (H5N1) viruses outside Asia, clearly depict the lineages now infecting wild and domestic birds in Europe and Africa and show the relationships among these isolates and other strains affecting both birds and humans. The isolates fall into 3 distinct lineages, 1 of which contains all known non-Asian isolates. This new Euro-African lineage, which was the cause of several recent (2006) fatal human infections in Egypt and Iraq, has been introduced at least 3 times into the European-African region and has split into 3 distinct, independently evolving sublineages. One isolate provides evidence that 2 of these sublineages have recently reassorted.

Title: The threat of avian influenza H5N1: 'do we have the tools for the job'?
Abstract: For the first time in human history virologists have the knowledge about the avian origin of pandemic influenza A viruses. Furthermore, in the last two decades a new class of anti influenza drugs, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), has been developed from an academic discovery to a series of antiviral drugs to be used in the clinic. At present vaccinologists are producing influenza A (H5N1) vaccines to be stockpiled alongside the NIs to combat the first wave of an anticipated influenza pandemic. Studies from the 1918 infection calamity, the Spanish influenza, and the succeeding pandemics of 1957 and 1968, all caused by avian influenza A viruses, have shown how quickly such a virus can mutate to become less virulent (starting with 50% case fatality) and more infectious. Such a mutation cluster could lead to a rapid increase in world deaths, currently 170, to many millions. However there are optimistic analyses: judicious and swift application of NIs, vaccine and hygiene to an outbreak epicentre, most likely in South-East Asia, could break the chain of transmission.

Title: FluGenome: a web tool for genotyping influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are hosted by numerous avian and mammalian species, which have shaped their evolution into distinct lineages worldwide. The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution.

Title: Selenium deficiency alters epithelial cell morphology and responses to influenza.
Abstract: It is unknown whether nutritional deficiencies affect the morphology and function of structural cells, such as epithelial cells, and modify the susceptibility to viral infections. We developed an in vitro system of differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) grown either under selenium-adequate (Se+) or selenium-deficient (Se-) conditions, to determine whether selenium deficiency impairs host defense responses at the level of the epithelium. Se- BECs had normal SOD activity, but decreased activity of the selenium-dependent enzyme GPX1. Interestingly, catalase activity was also decreased in Se- BECs. Both Se- and Se+ BECs differentiated into a mucociliary epithelium; however, Se- BEC demonstrated increased mucus production and increased Muc5AC mRNA levels. This effect was also seen in Se+ BEC treated with 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of catalase activity, suggesting an association between catalase activity and mucus production. Both Se- and Se+ were infected with influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 and examined 24 h postinfection. Influenza-induced IL-6 production was greater while influenza-induced IP-10 production was lower in Se- BECs. In addition, influenza-induced apoptosis was greater in Se- BEC as compared to the Se+ BECs. These data demonstrate that selenium deficiency has a significant impact on the morphology and influenza-induced host defense responses in human airway epithelial cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines effects of selenium deficiency on host epithelial cells and their response to influenza infection, focusing on host phenotype rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Characterization of low-pathogenic H5 subtype influenza viruses from Eurasia: implications for the origin of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are now endemic in many Asian countries, resulting in repeated outbreaks in poultry and increased cases of human infection. The immediate precursor of these HPAI viruses is believed to be A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD)-like H5N1 HPAI viruses first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996. From 2000 onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1 viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in Eurasia.

Title: Emergence of drug resistance: implications for antiviral control of pandemic influenza.
Abstract: Given the danger of an unprecedented spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in humans, and great challenges to the development of an effective influenza vaccine, antiviral drugs will probably play a pivotal role in combating a novel pandemic strain. A critical limitation to the use of these drugs is the evolution of highly transmissible drug-resistant viral mutants. Here, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of an antiviral treatment strategy on the emergence of drug resistance and containment of a pandemic. The results show that elimination of the wild-type strain depends crucially on both the early onset of treatment in indexed cases and population-level treatment. Given the probable delay of 0.5-1 day in seeking healthcare and therefore initiating therapy, the findings indicate that a single strategy of antiviral treatment will be unsuccessful at controlling the spread of disease if the reproduction number of the wild-type strain (R0s) exceeds 1.4. We demonstrate the possible occurrence of a self-sustaining epidemic of resistant strain, in terms of its transmission fitness relative to the wild-type, and the reproduction number R0s. Considering reproduction numbers estimated for the past three pandemics, the findings suggest that an uncontrollable pandemic is likely to occur if resistant viruses with relative transmission fitness above 0.4 emerge. While an antiviral strategy is crucial for containing a pandemic, its effectiveness depends critically on timely and strategic use of drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a modeling study on antiviral drug resistance emergence and pandemic control, without direct genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: First introduction of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A viruses in wild and domestic birds in Denmark, Northern Europe.
Abstract: Since 2005 highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia to Africa and Europe infecting poultry, humans and wild birds. HP H5N1 virus was isolated in Denmark for the first time in March 2006. A total of 44 wild birds were found positive for the HP H5N1 infection. In addition, one case was reported in a backyard poultry flock. Full-genome characterisation of nine isolates revealed that the Danish H5N1 viruses were highly similar to German H5N1 isolates in all genes from the same time period. The haemagglutinin gene grouped phylogenetically in H5 clade 2 subclade 2 and closest relatives besides the German isolates were isolates from Croatia in 2005, Nigeria and Niger in 2006 and isolates from Astrakhan in Russia 2006. The German and Danish isolates shared unique substitutions in the NA, PB1 and NS2 proteins. The first case of HP H5N1 infection of wild and domestic birds in Denmark was experienced in March 2006. This is the first full genome characterisation of HP H5N1 avian influenza A virus in the Nordic countries. The Danish viruses from this time period have their origin from the wild bird strains from Qinghai in 2005. These viruses may have been introduced to the Northern Europe through unusual migration due to the cold weather in Eastern Europe at that time.

Title: Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection: targets and strategies for chemotherapeutic intervention.
Abstract: In an avian flu pandemic, which drugs could be used to treat or prevent infection with influenza A (H5N1) virus? Foremost are the viral neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have already been used to treat human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B virus infections. The use of the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine is compounded by the rapid development of drug resistance. Although formally approved for other indications (i.e. treatment of hepatitis C), ribavirin and pegylated interferon might also be useful for controlling avian flu. Combined use of the currently available drugs should be taken into account and attempts should be made to develop new strategies directed at unexplored targets such as the viral proteins hemagglutinin, the viral polymerase (and endonuclease) and the non-structural protein NS1. As has been shown for other viral infections, RNA interference could be a powerful means with which to suppress the replication of avian H5N1.

Title: Influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, but not the matrix protein, are required for assembly and budding of plasmid-derived virus-like particles.
Abstract: For influenza virus, we developed an efficient, noncytotoxic, plasmid-based virus-like particle (VLP) system to reflect authentic virus particles. This system was characterized biochemically by analysis of VLP protein composition, morphologically by electron microscopy, and functionally with a VLP infectivity assay. The VLP system was used to address the identity of the minimal set of viral proteins required for budding. Combinations of viral proteins were expressed in cells, and the polypeptide composition of the particles released into the culture media was analyzed. Contrary to previous findings in which matrix (M1) protein was considered to be the driving force of budding because M1 was found to be released copiously into the culture medium when M1 was expressed by using the vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase-driven overexpression system, in our noncytotoxic VLP system M1 was not released efficiently into the culture medium. Additionally, hemagglutinin (HA), when treated with exogenous neuraminidase (NA) or coexpressed with viral NA, could be released from cells independently of M1. Incorporation of M1 into VLPs required HA expression, although when M1 was omitted from VLPs, particles with morphologies similar to those of wild-type VLPs or viruses were observed. Furthermore, when HA and NA cytoplasmic tail mutants were included in the VLPs, M1 failed to be efficiently incorporated into VLPs, consistent with a model in which the glycoproteins control virus budding by sorting to lipid raft microdomains and recruiting the internal viral core components. VLP formation also occurred independently of the function of Vps4 in the multivesicular body pathway, as dominant-negative Vps4 proteins failed to inhibit influenza VLP budding.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on viral protein requirements for virus-like particle assembly and budding, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Conserved surface features form the double-stranded RNA binding site of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) from influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic widespread epidemics with high mortality rates. The influenza A virus NS1 protein (NS1A) plays a key role in countering host antiviral defense and in virulence. The 73-residue N-terminal domain of NS1A (NS1A-(1-73)) forms a symmetric homodimer with a unique six-helical chain fold. It binds canonical A-form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mutational inactivation of this dsRNA binding activity of NS1A highly attenuates virus replication. Here, we have characterized the unique structural features of the dsRNA binding surface of NS1A-(1-73) using NMR methods and describe the 2.1-A x-ray crystal structure of the corresponding dsRNA binding domain from human influenza B virus NS1B-(15-93). These results identify conserved dsRNA binding surfaces on both NS1A-(1-73) and NS1B-(15-93) that are very different from those indicated in earlier "working models" of the complex between dsRNA and NS1A-(1-73). The combined NMR and crystallographic data reveal highly conserved surface tracks of basic and hydrophilic residues that interact with dsRNA. These tracks are structurally complementary to the polyphosphate backbone conformation of A-form dsRNA and run at an approximately 45 degrees angle relative to the axes of helices alpha2/alpha2'. At the center of this dsRNA binding epitope, and common to NS1 proteins from influenza A and B viruses, is a deep pocket that includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. This pocket provides a target on the surface of the NS1 protein that is potentially suitable for the development of antiviral drugs targeting both influenza A and B viruses.

Title: Design and validation of an H5 TaqMan real-time one-step reverse transcription-PCR and confirmatory assays for diagnosis and verification of influenza A virus H5 infections in humans.
Abstract: Increasing diversity among influenza H5N1 viruses has resulted in the need for sensitive and specific diagnostic assays, fully validated for the detection of H5 viruses belonging to all hemagglutinin (HA) clades, particularly the recently circulating H5N1 viruses of clade 2. In this report, the development and validation of a real-time, one-step TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay specific for the detection of influenza A H5 viruses from clades 1, 1', 2, and 3 is described. The real-time assay for H5 virus was shown to be highly sensitive, detecting H5 virus levels of <1 PFU from each of the HA clades. Specificity of the H5 RT-PCR for influenza A H5 viruses was demonstrated by using influenza A viruses of different subtypes, clinical samples containing influenza A viruses H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, influenza B viruses, and other respiratory viruses. The usefulness of the inclusion of a distinguishable assay positive control and of confirmatory assays for the laboratory diagnosis and verification of H5 virus infections was demonstrated. A real-time RT-PCR pyrosequencing assay, a restriction enzyme digestion assay, and direct sequencing of the H5 real-time RT-PCR amplicon were validated for the confirmation of H5 detection by the diagnostic real-time assay. The H5 real-time assay was applied to diagnostic testing for suspected cases of influenza A virus H5 infection in the United Kingdom. Influenza A H5 viruses were not detected in the cases analyzed; however, influenza A H3N2 virus was detected in 57% of the suspected cases of H5. The H5 TaqMan real-time RT-PCR and confirmatory assays will be useful tools for the laboratory surveillance and rapid diagnosis of H5 infections in humans.

Title: Avian influenza virus (H5N1): a threat to human health.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza virus has its origins in avian influenza viruses. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is already panzootic in poultry, with attendant economic consequences. It continues to cross species barriers to infect humans and other mammals, often with fatal outcomes. Therefore, H5N1 virus has rightly received attention as a potential pandemic threat. However, it is noted that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H5N1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H5N1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health. Here, we review the ecology and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, assess the pandemic risk, and address aspects of human H5N1 disease in relation to its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

Title: The transmissibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry in industrialised countries.
Abstract: With the increased occurrence of outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time. It therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper analyzes epidemiological transmissibility data at the farm level without direct genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Virus glycosylation: role in virulence and immune interactions.
Abstract: The study of N-linked glycosylation as it relates to virus biology has become an area of intense interest in recent years due to its ability to impart various advantages to virus survival and virulence. HIV and influenza, two clear threats to human health, have been shown to rely on expression of specific oligosaccharides to evade detection by the host immune system. Additionally, other viruses such as Hendra, SARS-CoV, influenza, hepatitis and West Nile rely on N-linked glycosylation for crucial functions such as entry into host cells, proteolytic processing and protein trafficking. This review focuses on recent findings on the importance of glycosylation to viral virulence and immune evasion for several prominent human pathogens.

Title: Potential risks associated with the proposed widespread use of Tamiflu.
Abstract: The threat of pandemic influenza has focused attention and resources on virus surveillance, prevention, and containment. The World Health Organization has strongly recommended the use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu both to treat and prevent pandemic influenza infection. A major concern for the long-term efficacy of this strategy is to limit the development of Tamiflu-resistant influenza strains. However, in the event of a pandemic, hundreds of millions of courses of Tamiflu, stockpiled globally, will be rapidly deployed. Given its apparent resistance to biodegradation and hydrophilicity, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active antiviral and metabolite of Tamiflu, is predicted to enter receiving riverwater from sewage treatment works in its active form. Our objective in this study was to determine the likely concentrations of OC released into U.S. and U.K. river catchments using hydrologic modeling and current assumptions about the course and management of an influenza pandemic. We predict that high concentrations of OC (micrograms per liter) capable of inhibiting influenza virus replication would be sustained for periods of several weeks, presenting an increased risk for the generation of antiviral resistance and genetic exchange between influenza viruses in wildfowl. Owing to the apparent recalcitrance of OC in sewage treatment works, widespread use of Tamiflu during an influenza pandemic also poses a potentially significant, uncharacterized, ecotoxicologic risk in each affected nation's waterways. To gauge the hazard presented by Tamiflu use during a pandemic, we recommend a) direct measurement of Tamiflu persistence, biodegradation, and transformation in the environment; b) further modeling of likely drug concentrations in the catchments of countries where humans and waterfowl come into frequent dose contact, and where significant Tamiflu deployment is envisaged; and c) further characterization of the risks of generating Tamiflu-resistant viruses in OC-exposed wildfowl.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses environmental risks and antiviral resistance development related to Tamiflu use, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus infection causes specific degradation of the largest subunit of cellular RNA polymerase II.
Abstract: It has been described that influenza virus polymerase associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). To gain information about the role of this interaction, we explored if changes in RNAP II occur during infection. Here we show that influenza virus causes the specific degradation of the hypophosphorylated form of the largest subunit of RNAP II without affecting the accumulation of its hyperphosphorylated forms. This effect is independent of the viral strain and the origin of the cells used. Analysis of synthesized mRNAs in isolated nuclei of infected cells indicated that transcription decreases concomitantly with RNAP II degradation. Moreover, this degradation correlated with the onset of viral transcription and replication. The ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway is not involved in virally induced RNAP II proteolysis. The expression of viral polymerase from its cloned cDNAs was sufficient to cause the degradation. Since the PA polymerase subunit has proteolytic activity, we tested its participation in the process. A recombinant virus that encodes a PA point mutant with decreased proteolytic activity and that has defects in replication delayed the effect, suggesting that PA's contribution to RNAP II degradation occurs during infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on influenza virus-induced degradation of host RNA polymerase II and its effects on transcription, without linking viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: Structure and function of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus.
Abstract: The avian influenza A virus currently prevailing in Asia causes fatal pneumonia and multiple organ failure in birds and humans. Despite intensive research, understanding of the characteristics of influenza A virus that determine its virulence is incomplete. NS1A protein, a non-structural protein of influenza A virus, was reported to contribute to its pathogenicity and virulence. NS1A protein is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in resisting the host antiviral response during the influenza infection. This review briefly outlines the current knowledge on the structure and function of the NS1A protein.
Relevant: False
Reason: A review of the NS1 protein structure and function without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Rationale for treating human influenza infections by passive transfer of specific antibodies.
Abstract: The fear of a potential pandemic with a highly pathogenic influenza A virus, such as the avian virus H5N1, has rightly prompted multidisciplinary reflections and calls for better preparedness all over the world. In terms of therapeutic aspects, most of the focus has been on vaccines and antivirals. The present 'opinion paper' intends to discuss a different therapeutic approach, although not mutually exclusive to the two others quoted above. We here propose an approach, based on well-documented experimental evidence in animal models, in which a short series of human monoclonal antibodies adapted to the probable pandemic strain, specific for external antigens of that influenza virus and shown in vitro and in experimental models to have neutralizing properties, are prepared and stockpiled for administration to people recently exposed to the pandemic virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: Discusses therapeutic approaches using antibodies without explicit analysis of viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Challenges for the laboratory before and during an influenza pandemic.
Abstract: Laboratory tests that reliably confirm infection with a novel influenza strain are a major component of pandemic planning. Combined nose and throat swabs are the most practical respiratory tract sample to safely obtain from patients. As nucleic acid tests are sensitive, specific and rapid, they will be the diagnostic test of choice during a pandemic. Virus isolation (in laboratories with Physical Containment level 3 facilities) is required for characterisation of the pandemic strain and vaccine development. Antiviral resistance testing may be required if antiviral drugs are used extensively to help control a pandemic. Diagnostic strategies will vary throughout the various pandemic phases.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on laboratory diagnostic challenges during a pandemic without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Influenza virus targets the mRNA export machinery and the nuclear pore complex.
Abstract: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a major virulence factor that is essential for pathogenesis. NS1 functions to impair innate and adaptive immunity by inhibiting host signal transduction and gene expression, but its mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. We show here that NS1 forms an inhibitory complex with NXF1/TAP, p15/NXT, Rae1/mrnp41, and E1B-AP5, which are key constituents of the mRNA export machinery that interact with both mRNAs and nucleoporins to direct mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex. Increased levels of NXF1, p15, or Rae1 revert the mRNA export blockage induced by NS1. Furthermore, influenza virus down-regulates Nup98, a nucleoporin that is a docking site for mRNA export factors. Reduced expression of these mRNA export factors renders cells highly permissive to influenza virus replication, demonstrating that proper levels of key constituents of the mRNA export machinery protect against influenza virus replication. Because Nup98 and Rae1 are induced by interferons, down-regulation of this pathway is likely a viral strategy to promote viral replication. These findings demonstrate previously undescribed influenza-mediated viral-host interactions and provide insights into potential molecular therapies that may interfere with influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes NS1 protein interactions with host mRNA export machinery without explicit links between viral genotype and phenotype.

Title: The PB1-F2 protein of Influenza A virus: increasing pathogenicity by disrupting alveolar macrophages.
Abstract: With the prospect of another pandemic Influenza fresh in our consciousness, the pathogenic nature of the Influenza A virus and its ability to induce high rates of mortality are ever more pertinent. Recently a novel protein encoded by an alternate reading frame in the PB1 Gene segment of Influenza A virus has been discovered and in turn shown to enhance viral virulence in a mouse model 1. This protein has been shown to specifically target and destroy alveolar macrophages 2. This review suggests that this protein, present in all previous pandemic strains, may reappear as a virulence factor in a subsequent pandemic strain. This PB1-F2 protein will enhance the mortality rate of the virus by increasing the likelihood of a secondary bacterial infection, which is the primary cause of death to a patient infected with Influenza A.
Relevant: False
Reason: A review discussing the PB1-F2 protein's role in pathogenicity without direct experimental genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Influenza virus infection of the murine uterus: a new model for antiviral immunity in the female reproductive tract.
Abstract: Secretory IgA (S-IgA) mediates local immunity to influenza virus in the murine upper respiratory tract and may play an important role in local immunity to various microorganisms in the female reproductive tract as well. Although the presence of IgA in cervicovaginal or uterine secretions has been correlated with immunity to a number of pathogens, there has been no direct demonstration of the mediation of uterine antiviral immunity by S-IgA. Influenza virus, although not a normal pathogen of the reproductive tract, was used to develop a model for the investigation of mucosal immunity in the uterus. PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus injected into the ovarian bursa of BALB/c mice grew well, with peak titers between days 3 and 5. Intravenous injection of polymeric IgA anti-influenza virus monoclonal antibody before or 30 min after viral challenge protected mice against viral infection. We believe this work to be the first direct demonstration of S-IgA-mediated antiviral uterine immunity. It provides a model for further investigation of immunity in the female reproductive tract.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on local immunity mediated by secretory IgA in the murine uterus against influenza virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Efficacy of orally administered T-705 on lethal avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections in mice.
Abstract: T-705 (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) was inhibitory to four strains of avian H5N1 influenza virus in MDCK cells, with the 90% effective concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 7.7 microM, as determined by a virus yield reduction assay. The efficacy was less than that exerted by oseltamivir carboxylate or zanamivir but was greater than that exerted by ribavirin. Experiments with mice lethally infected with influenza A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) virus showed that T-705 administered per os once, twice, or four times daily for 5 days beginning 1 h after virus exposure was highly inhibitory to the infection. Dosages from 30 to 300 mg/kg of body weight/day were well tolerated; each prevented death, lessened the decline of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), and inhibited lung consolidation and lung virus titers. Dosages from 30 to 300 mg/kg/day administered once or twice daily also significantly prevented the death of the mice. Oseltamivir (20 mg/kg/day), administered per os twice daily for 5 days, was tested in parallel in two experiments; it was only weakly effective against the infection. The four-times-daily T-705 treatments at 300 mg/kg/day could be delayed until 96 h after virus exposure and still significantly inhibit the infection. Single T-705 treatments administered up to 60 h after virus exposure also prevented death and the decline of SaO(2). Characterization of the pathogenesis of the duck influenza H5N1 virus used in these studies was undertaken; although the virus was highly pathogenic to mice, it was less neurotropic than has been described for clinical isolates of the H5N1 virus. These data indicate that T-705 may be useful for the treatment of avian influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates the efficacy of an antiviral compound (T-705) against avian influenza virus infections in mice, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Anti-influenza virus activities of 4-[(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)amino]-N-(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulphonamide and its derivatives.
Abstract: 4-[(1,2-Dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)amino]-N-(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidinyl)-benzenesulphonamide (SPIII-5H) and related compounds were tested for antiviral activity against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1) and B viruses in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture. Among the compounds tested, SPIII-5H and four derivatives (5-chloro [SPill-5Cl], 5-bromo [SPIII-5Br], 5-methyl [SPIII-5Me] and N-acetyl [SPIII-NA]) showed similar antiviral potencies, with only the 5-fluoro (SPIII-5F) derivative being ineffective. Fifty percent effective concentration (EC50) values were determined in cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays quantified by neutral red dye uptake. By this method, the active compounds were inhibitory to the H1N1 strain of influenza A at 2.7-5.2 microg/ml, to the H3N2 strain of influenza A at 13.8-26.0 microg/ml, to the H5N1 strain of influenza A at 3.1-6.3 microg/ml and to influenza B at 7.7-11.5 microg/ml. Confirmatory virus yield reduction studies against influenza A (H1N1) virus demonstrated antiviral activity (90% inhibition) at concentrations of 2-10 microg/ml. No cytotoxic effects were evident in actively growing uninfected cells or stationary monolayers at 100 microg/ml. Potencies of the compounds were similar to those of ribavirin, but much less than those of oseltamivir carboxylate against the various viruses. Time-of-addition studies indicated the compounds inhibited an early step in the virus replication cycle, probably virus adsorption/penetration, and no virucidal activity was evident. The basic molecule is amenable to diverse chemical modifications, which may improve water solubility and antiviral potency.

Title: Prevention of antigenically drifted influenza by inactivated and live attenuated vaccines.
Abstract: The efficacy of influenza vaccines may decline during years when the circulating viruses have antigenically drifted from those included in the vaccine. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy adults during the 2004-2005 influenza season and estimated both absolute and relative efficacies. A total of 1247 persons were vaccinated between October and December 2004. Influenza activity in Michigan began in January 2005 with the circulation of an antigenically drifted type A (H3N2) virus, the A/California/07/2004-like strain, and of type B viruses from two lineages. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine against both types of virus was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37 to 92) as measured by isolating the virus in cell culture, 75% (95% CI, 42 to 90) as measured by either isolating the virus in cell culture or identifying it through real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 67% (95% CI, 16 to 87) as measured by either isolating the virus or observing a rise in the serum antibody titer. The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine were 57% (95% CI, -3 to 82), 48% (95% CI, -7 to 74), and 30% (95% CI, -57 to 67), respectively. The difference in efficacy between the two vaccines appeared to be related mainly to reduced protection of the live attenuated vaccine against type B viruses. In the 2004-2005 season, in which most circulating viruses were dissimilar to those included in the vaccine, the inactivated vaccine was efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic illnesses from influenza in healthy adults. The live attenuated vaccine also prevented influenza illnesses but was less efficacious. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00133523.)

Title: Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza.
Abstract: The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into Asia, Europe, and Africa has resulted in enormous impacts on the poultry industry and presents an important threat to human health. The pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models global spread of H5N1 integrating phylogenetic and ecological data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: 'Genome gating'; polarized intranuclear trafficking of influenza virus RNPs.
Abstract: Many viruses exploit cellular polarity to constrain the assembly and release of progeny virions to a desired surface. Influenza virus particles are released only from the apical surface of epithelial cells and this polarization is partly owing to specific targeting of the viral membrane proteins to the apical plasma membrane. The RNA genome of the virus is transcribed and replicated in the nucleus, necessitating nuclear export of the individual ribonucleoprotein (RNP) segments before they can be incorporated into budding virus particles. We show that the process of polarized virus assembly begins in the nucleus with the RNPs adopting a novel asymmetric distribution at the inner nuclear membrane prior to their export to the cytoplasm. The viral nucleoprotein, the major protein component of RNPs, displays the same polarized intranuclear distribution in the absence of other influenza virus components, suggesting the existence of a hitherto unrecognized polarity within the mammalian cell nucleus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes polarized intranuclear trafficking of influenza virus RNPs but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: [Surveillance and control measures of avian influenza in birds. Implications for public health].
Abstract: Avian influenza is an infectious disease that mainly affects birds, caused by influenza A type viruses, in most cases of low pathogenecity. Rapid mutations of these viruses to highly pathogenic forms represent a serious risk for animal and public health. Since 2003, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds is taking place with transmission and resulting illness in humans and which is believed to be able to start a human influenza pandemic. To face these outbreaks, a joint effort between the animal and public health sector is needed to identify areas affected by animal disease and to intensify surveillance of human cases in them. Control measures in animals must be compatible with risk reduction of human exposure. The aim of this article is to review the general control measures developed against avian influenza in birds, highlighting coordination and communication aspects between Animal Health and Public Health, taking into account that legislation is constantly being updated as the dynamic of the disease changes.

Title: Influenza Virus Database (IVDB): an integrated information resource and analysis platform for influenza virus research.
Abstract: Frequent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza and the increasing data available for comparative analysis require a central database specialized in influenza viruses (IVs). We have established the Influenza Virus Database (IVDB) to integrate information and create an analysis platform for genetic, genomic, and phylogenetic studies of the virus. IVDB hosts complete genome sequences of influenza A virus generated by Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) and curates all other published IV sequences after expert annotation. Our Q-Filter system classifies and ranks all nucleotide sequences into seven categories according to sequence content and integrity. IVDB provides a series of tools and viewers for comparative analysis of the viral genomes, genes, genetic polymorphisms and phylogenetic relationships. A search system has been developed for users to retrieve a combination of different data types by setting search options. To facilitate analysis of global viral transmission and evolution, the IV Sequence Distribution Tool (IVDT) has been developed to display the worldwide geographic distribution of chosen viral genotypes and to couple genomic data with epidemiological data. The BLAST, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis tools were integrated for online data analysis. Furthermore, IVDB offers instant access to pre-computed alignments and polymorphisms of IV genes and proteins, and presents the results as SNP distribution plots and minor allele distributions. IVDB is publicly available at http://influenza.genomics.org.cn.

Title: Protective avian influenza in ovo vaccination with non-replicating human adenovirus vector.
Abstract: Protective immunity against avian influenza virus was elicited in chickens by single-dose in ovo vaccination with a non-replicating human adenovirus vector encoding an H5N9 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin. Vaccinated chickens were protected against both H5N1 (89% hemagglutinin homology; 68% protection) and H5N2 (94% hemagglutinin homology; 100% protection) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus challenges. This vaccine can be mass-administered using available robotic in ovo injectors which provide a major advantage over current vaccination regimens. In addition, this class of adenovirus-vectored vaccines can be produced rapidly with improved safety since they do not contain any replication-competent adenoviruses. Furthermore, this mode of vaccination is compatible with epidemiological surveys of natural avian influenza virus infections.

Title: A critical role for ICOS co-stimulation in immune containment of pulmonary influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Lung pathology observed during influenza infection is due to direct damage resulting from viral replication and bystander damage caused by overly exuberant antiviral immune mechanisms. In the absence of universally effective vaccines and antiviral therapies, knowledge of the cellular components required for immune containment of influenza is essential. ICOS is a late co-stimulatory molecule expressed by T cells 12-24 h after activation. We show for the first time that inhibition of ICOS with a monoclonal antibody reduces pulmonary T cell inflammation and associated cytokine expression. Surprisingly however, this reduction in T cells was not accompanied by an alleviation of weight loss and illness. Furthermore, lung viral titres were elevated following anti-ICOS treatment, suggesting that the beneficial outcome of reducing T cell pathology was masked by enhanced virus-induced damage and innate inflammation. This study demonstrates the delicate balance that exists between pathogen burden and pulmonary T cell inflammation during influenza infection and highlights the critical role of ICOS in this response.

Title: [Diagnosis and Treatment of influenza--clinical investigation on viral shedding in children with influenza].
Abstract: Children with influenza usually shed viruses from the several days before onset of clinical symptoms, and viruses are isolated for one or two weeks after onset. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests are useful to guide use of antiviral agents, appears over 90% sensitivity and specificity for influenza A with nasopharyngeal specimens compared with cell culture. The detection limits of these test kits are 103 pfu or over, so it is necessary to consider viral load in clinical specimens for diagnosis with these kits. Viral load are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but influenza viruses are isolated in more than half of pediatric patients when fever get down, and resistant viruses are detected in some of these patients. It is very important for influenza control to investigate on viral shedding and resistant viruses.

Title: Evidence of influenza a virus RNA in siberian lake ice.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infects a large proportion of the human population annually, sometimes leading to the deaths of millions. The biotic cycles of infection are well characterized in the literature, including in studies of populations of humans, poultry, swine, and migratory waterfowl. However, there are few studies of abiotic reservoirs for this virus. Here, we report the preservation of influenza A virus genes in ice and water from high-latitude lakes that are visited by large numbers of migratory birds. The lakes are along the migratory flight paths of birds flying into Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. The data suggest that influenza A virus, deposited as the birds begin their autumn migration, can be preserved in lake ice. As birds return in the spring, the ice melts, releasing the viruses. Therefore, temporal gene flow is facilitated between the viruses shed during the previous year and the viruses newly acquired by birds during winter months spent in the south. Above the Arctic Circle, the cycles of entrapment in the ice and release by melting can be variable in length, because some ice persists for several years, decades, or longer. This type of temporal gene flow might be a feature common to viruses that can survive entrapment in environmental ice and snow.

Title: Robust sequence selection method used to develop the FluChip diagnostic microarray for influenza virus.
Abstract: DNA microarrays have proven to be powerful tools for gene expression analyses and are becoming increasingly attractive for diagnostic applications, e.g., for virus identification and subtyping. The selection of appropriate sequences for use on a microarray poses a challenge, particularly for highly mutable organisms such as influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency viruses, and hepatitis C viruses. The goal of this work was to develop an efficient method for mining large databases in order to identify regions of conservation in the influenza virus genome. From these regions of conservation, capture and label sequences capable of discriminating between different viral types and subtypes were selected. The salient features of the method were the use of phylogenetic trees for data reduction and the selection of a relatively small number of capture and label sequences capable of identifying a broad spectrum of influenza viruses. A detailed experimental evaluation of the selected sequences is described in a companion paper. The software is freely available under the General Public License at http://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/RGHP/software/.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2005.
Abstract: Surveillance of influenza in Australia is based on laboratory isolation of influenza viruses, sentinel general-practitioner reports of influenza-like illness, and absenteeism data from a major national employer. In 2005, 4,575 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness were reported, which was 115 per cent higher than in 2004. The influenza season started in the first week of June, with peak activity in early August, a month earlier than in 2004. Influenza A was the predominant type notified (73%), while influenza B activity continued to increase compared to previous years. During 2005, the influenza notification rate amongst persons aged over 65 years (22 cases per 100,000 population) was 70 per cent higher than the mean rate of the last four years. One thousand one hundred and seventy-four influenza isolates from Australia were antigenically analysed: 689 were A(H3N2), 210 were A(H1N1) strains and 275 were influenza B viruses. Continued antigenic drift was seen with the A(H3N2) viruses from the previous reference strains with approximately one quarter of isolates being distinguishable from A/Wellington/1/2004-like viruses and more closely matched to A/California/7/2004-like viruses.

Title: Transactivation of elements in the human endogenous retrovirus W family by viral infection.
Abstract: Aberrant expression of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) elements in the W family has previously been associated with schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and preeclampsia. Little is know regarding the basal expression, transcriptional regulation and functional significance of individual HERV-elements. Since viral infections have previously been reported to transactivate retroviral long terminal repeat regions we examined the basal expression of HERV-W elements and following infections by influenza A/WSN/33 and Herpes simplex 1 viruses in human cell-lines. Relative levels of transcripts encoding HERV-W elements and cellular genes were analyzed by qPCR methods. An analysis of amplicon melting temperatures was used to detect variations in the frequencies of amplicons in discrete ranges of such melting temperatures. These frequency-distributions were taken as proxy markers for the repertoires of transcribed HERV-W elements in the cells. We report cell-specific expression patterns of HERV-W elements during base-line conditions. Expressed elements include those with intact regulatory long terminal repeat regions (LTRs) as well as elements flanked by truncated LTRs. Subsets of HERV-W elements were transactivated by viral infection in the different cell-lines. Transcriptional activation of these elements, including that encoding syncytin, was dependent on viral replication and was not induced by antiviral responses. Serum deprivation of cells induced similar changes in the expression of HERV-W elements suggesting that the observed phenomena are, in part, an effect of cellular stress. We found that HERV-W elements, including elements lacking regulatory LTRs, are expressed in cell-specific patterns which can be modulated by environmental influences. This brings into light that mechanisms behind the regulation of expression of HERV-W elements are more complex than previously assumed and suggests biological functions of these transcripts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses expression patterns of HERV-W elements modulated by viral infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Planning for avian influenza.
Abstract: Avian influenza, or influenza A (H5N1), has 3 of the 4 properties necessary to cause a serious pandemic: It can infect people, nearly all people are immunologically naive, and it is highly lethal. The Achilles heel of the virus is the lack of sustained human-human transmission. Fortunately, among the 124 cases reported through 30 May 2006, nearly all were acquired by direct contact with poultry. Unfortunately, the capability for efficient human-human transmission requires only a single mutation by a virus that is notoriously genetically unstable, hence the need for a new vaccine each year for seasonal influenza. Influenza A (H5N1) is being compared to another avian strain, the agent of the "Spanish flu" of 1918-1919, which traversed the world in 3 months and caused an estimated 50 million deaths. The question is, are we ready for this type of pandemic? The answer is probably no. The main problems are the lack of an effective vaccine, very poor surge capacity, a health care system that could not accommodate even a modest pandemic, and erratic regional planning. It's time to get ready, and in the process be ready for bioterrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics of other infectious diseases.

Title: Avian influenza H5N1 in viverrids: implications for wildlife health and conservation.
Abstract: The Asian countries chronically infected with avian influenza A H5N1 are 'global hotspots' for biodiversity conservation in terms of species diversity, endemism and levels of threat. Since 2003, avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have naturally infected and killed a range of wild bird species, four felid species and a mustelid. Here, we report fatal disseminated H5N1 infection in a globally threatened viverrid, the Owston's civet, in Vietnam, highlighting the risk that avian influenza H5N1 poses to mammalian and avian biodiversity across its expanding geographic range.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports infection and fatality in viverrids by H5N1 but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus: the threat of a pandemic.
Abstract: The 1918 influenza A virus pandemic caused a death toll of 40 to approximately 50 million. Currently, because of the widespread dissemination of the avian influenza virus (H5N1), there is a high risk of another pandemic. Avian species are the natural hosts for numerous subtypes of influenza A viruses; however, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) is not only extremely lethal to domestic avian species but also can infect humans and cause death. This review discusses why the avian influenza virus is considered the most likely candidate for the first flu pandemic of the 21st century.

Title: In vitro inhibition of human influenza A virus replication by chloroquine.
Abstract: Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinolone with well-known anti-malarial effects. It has biochemical properties that could be applied to inhibit viral replication. We report here that chloroquine is able to inhibit influenza A virus replication, in vitro, and the IC50s of chloroquine against influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 are lower than the plasma concentrations reached during treatment of acute malaria. The potential of chloroquine to be added to the limited range of anti-influenza drugs should be explored further, particularly since antiviral drugs play a vital role in influenza pandemic preparedness.

Title: Prospects for universal influenza virus vaccine.
Abstract: The current vaccination strategy against influenza A and B viruses is vulnerable to the unanticipated emergence of epidemic strains that are poorly matched by the vaccine. A vaccine that is less sensitive to the antigenic evolution of the virus would be a major improvement. The general feasibility of this goal is supported by studies in animal models that show that immunologic activities directed against relatively invariant viral determinants can reduce illness and death. The most promising approaches are based on antibodies specific for the relatively conserved ectodomain of matrix protein 2 and the intersubunit region of hemagglutinin. However, additional conserved determinants for protective antibodies are likely to exist, and their identification should be encouraged. Most importantly, infection and current vaccines do not appear to effectively induce these antibodies in humans. This finding provides a powerful rationale for testing the protective activity of these relatively conserved viral components in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing prospects for universal influenza vaccines without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Human influenza surveillance: the demand to expand.
Abstract: The World Health Organization Influenza Program is one of the best developed and longest running infectious disease surveillance systems that exists. It maintains a worldwide watch of influenza's evolution to assist delivery of appropriately formulated vaccines in time to blunt seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Despite the program's success, however, much more is possible with today's advanced technologies. This article summarizes ongoing human influenza surveillance activities worldwide. It shows that the technology to establish a high-throughput laboratory network that can process and test influenza viruses more quickly and more accurately is available. It also emphasizes the practical public health and scientific applications of such a network.

Title: Relaxed phylogenetics and dating with confidence.
Abstract: In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.

Reason: This paper focuses on phylogenetic methods and evolutionary rate estimation without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: 1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics.
Abstract: The "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which caused approximately 50 million deaths worldwide, remains an ominous warning to public health. Many questions about its origins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health implications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt even as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a pandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new information about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example, sequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tissues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide answers to some critical questions. Understanding the 1918 pandemic and its implications for future pandemics requires careful experimentation and in-depth historical analysis.

Reason: This is a review/historical analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: Evaluation of a recombinant human adenovirus-5 vaccine administered via needle-free device and intramuscular injection for vaccination of pigs against swine influenza virus.
Abstract: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a human adenovirus-5 vaccine for protecting weaned pigs against swine influenza virus subtype H3N2 infection when administered via 2 injection methods. 76 pigs. 6 groups of weaned pigs received a 10-fold serial dilution of recombinant adenovirus expressing H3 hemagglutinin and a constant amount of recombinant adenovirus expressing nucleoprotein, either via a needle-free injection device or by traditional IM injection. In each group of 10 pigs, 1 served as a nonvaccinated contact pig to monitor whether there was spread of vaccinial virus from pig to pig. Vaccinated pigs and nonvaccinated controls were challenged or sham-inoculated 5 weeks later. After challenge, pigs were observed for clinical signs and nasal secretions were tested for virus. On day 5 after challenge, pigs were euthanatized; lungs were examined for gross lesions, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were tested for virus replication. A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response was elicited in a dose-dependent manner. Traditional IM administered vaccination induced consistently higher HI antibody responses than vaccination via needle-free injection, but the differences were not significant. Likewise, traditional IM administration was superior at reducing nasal virus shedding except at the highest dose, at which both methods blocked virus replication. The severity of lung lesions was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by both vaccination methods. Sentinel pigs did not seroconvert. The human adenovirus-5 vaccine at high doses prevented nasal virus shedding after challenge exposure with both methods of administration. The replication-defective vaccine virus was not transmitted to sentinel pigs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates vaccine safety and efficacy in pigs but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Quail carry sialic acid receptors compatible with binding of avian and human influenza viruses.
Abstract: There is growing evidence that some terrestrial avian species may play a role in the genesis of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. In the present investigation, we examined whether quail, a widespread-farmed poultry, possess the proper characteristics for serving as an intermediate host for the zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses. Using a lectin-based staining based on specific agglutinins, we found that, in addition to the presence of sialic acid alpha2,3-galactose (SAalpha2,3-gal) linked receptors, there are abundant sialic acid alpha2,6-galactose (SAalpha2,6-gal) linked receptors in quail trachea and intestine. The presence of abundant SAalpha2,6-gal-linked receptors explains, at least in part, the circulation of avian influenza viruses with human-like receptor specificity in quail. In quail trachea, SAalpha2,3-gal linked receptors are present primarily in non-ciliated cells, while SAalpha2,6-gal linked receptors are localized predominantly on the surface of ciliated cells. In quail intestine, both types of receptors were found on epithelial cells as well as in crypts. In a solid-phase overlay binding assay, both avian and human influenza viruses bind to plasma membranes prepared from epithelial cells of quail trachea and intestine, strongly suggesting that these receptors are functional for binding of influenza viruses from different species. Together with previous observations, these results are consistent with the notion that quail could provide an environment for the spread of reassortants between avian and human influenza viruses, thus acting as a potential intermediate host.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines receptor distribution in quail tissues relevant to virus binding but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mallards and highly pathogenic avian influenza ancestral viruses, northern Europe.
Abstract: Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which originate in poultry upon transmission of low pathogenic viruses from wild birds, have occurred relatively frequently in the last decade. During our ongoing surveillance studies in wild birds, we isolated several influenza A viruses of hemagglutinin subtype H5 and H7 that contain various neuraminidase subtypes. For each of the recorded H5 and H7 HPAI outbreaks in Europe since 1997, our collection contained closely related virus isolates recovered from wild birds, as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. The minor genetic and antigenic diversity between the viruses recovered from wild birds and those causing HPAI outbreaks indicates that influenza A virus surveillance studies in wild birds can help generate prototypic vaccine candidates and design and evaluate diagnostic tests, before outbreaks occur in animals and humans.

Reason: The paper reports phylogenetic and antigenic characterization of viruses from wild birds and outbreaks but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detailed analysis of the genetic evolution of influenza virus during the course of an epidemic.
Abstract: The genetic variability of influenza virus is usually studied with sequences selected over numerous years and countries, and rarely within a single season. Here we examined the viral evolution and the correlation between genetic and clinical features during an epidemic. From a French prospective household-based study in 1999-2000, 99 infected patients were randomly selected. The HA1 genomic domain was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of two groups of A/H3N2 viruses. We found no distinct pattern of genomic evolution within either group according to time. A spatial correlation with the nucleotide distances was shown. The average nucleotide diversity was 3.4x10-3 nucleotides per site, and did not differ between the groups. A lower number of segregating sites was observed in patients who experienced influenza-like symptoms during the previous epidemic. These results suggest that the influenza virus undergoes regular HA1 nucleotide changes, but without clonal expansion of mutant strains within a single epidemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies genetic variability and clinical features correlation but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus assembly and budding in raft-derived microdomains: a quantitative analysis of the surface distribution of HA, NA and M2 proteins.
Abstract: Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are known to associate with lipid rafts, membrane microdomains comprised of densely packed cholesterol and sphingolipids. These specialized membrane regions are believed to be involved in the budding of many enveloped viruses including influenza virus. Quantitative analysis of HA distribution on the surface of virus-infected cells by immunogold staining shows an organization into clusters that grow in size as the expression level of HA increases with time post-infection (p.i.) ( approximately 325-500 nm at 4 h p.i. and approximately 425-600 nm at 6 h p.i.). These HA-containing clusters are likely derived from lipid rafts as they contain a high density of the raft marker ganglioside GM1 and are dependent upon the presence of cholesterol. The clustering of HA is an intrinsic property of the HA protein and occurs in the absence of expression of other viral proteins. NA is also found sequestered within the same microdomains as HA, whereas the M2 ion channel protein does not concentrate within the raft-like microdomains. Quantification of the distribution of surface expressed HA by examining serial sections of virus-infected cells suggests that the HA-containing microdomains give rise to regions of influenza assembly and budding.

Title: Replication of respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus in HuH7 hepatocarcinoma cell line.
Abstract: Detection of viral antigens and isolation methods has long been used for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. The objective was to determine the ability of HuH7 cells to support the replication of prototype and wild strains of respiratory viruses. The cell culture-adapted strains of influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, both strains of the human metapneumoviruses, numerous rhinoviruses, most of the adenoviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, and a number of enteroviruses (poliovirus type 3, coxsackie virus B1, echovirus type 30) replicate in HuH7. The kinetic study of the replication of influenza A and B viruses showed that there were infected cells in HuH7 and MDCK lines as early as 24 hr post-infection. However, the replication of influenza A and B viruses was more rapid and intense on MDCK cells than on HuH7 cells. During the three winters of 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002, of the 1,226 (23.3%) direct fluorescent assay-positive nasal aspirates from children admitted to hospital, 788 were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, 228 for influenza virus, 133 for parainfluenza virus, and 77 for adenovirus. Of the 4,032 direct fluorescent assay-negative nasal aspirates, 571 virus isolates were identified by using HuH7 cell culture; 272 rhinoviruses, 100 influenza viruses A and B, 85 enteroviruses, 40 adenoviruses, 35 coronaviruses, 31 parainfluenza viruses, and 10 respiratory syncytial viruses. Interestingly, 100/328 (30.5%) influenza viruses A and B, 40/189 (21.1%) adenoviruses, and 31/164 (19%) parainfluenza viruses type 1-3, not detected by direct fluorescent assay, were identified by isolation in HuH7 cell culture.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2004.
Abstract: The National Influenza Surveillance Scheme includes data on influenza-like illness from sentinel general practitioner practices, laboratory reports of influenza from National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance Scheme and absenteeism data from a national employer. In 2004, 2,116 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness were reported, which was 41 per cent lower than the previous year. Peak activity was recorded in September, a month later than in 2003. Influenza A was again predominant while influenza B had an increased activity compared to the previous season. Four hundred and fifty-four isolates were antigenically analysed: 342 were A (H3N2 strain), 4 were A(H1N1 strain) strains and 108 were influenza B viruses. Further antigenic drift was seen in the A(H3N2) subtype with approximately one third of all isolates antigenically distinguishable from the A/Fujian/411/2002 reference strain. Vaccination coverage indicated that 79 per cent of Australians aged over 65 years received the 2004 influenza vaccine.

Title: Strategies for containing an emerging influenza pandemic in Southeast Asia.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on simulation modeling of pandemic containment strategies, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Cross-species transfer of viruses: implications for the use of viral vectors in biomedical research, gene therapy and as live-virus vaccines.
Abstract: All living organisms are continuously exposed to a plethora of viruses. In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host-range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross-species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The opportunities for cross-species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live-vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross-species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host-range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.

Reason: This is a review discussing cross-species viral transfer and risks of viral vectors, without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: Human infection by avian influenza A H5N1.
Abstract: The Southeast Asian outbreak of the highly lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infection in humans is unlikely to abate because of the enormous number of backyard farms providing poultry as the main source of food protein in developing countries. This increases the risk of the emergence of a reassortant pandemic influenza virus with improved human-to-human transmissibility. Currently triage of suspected cases by epidemiological risk factors remains the only practical way of case identification for laboratory investigation and infection control. The clinical usefulness of rapid diagnostic laboratory tests requires more vigorous evaluation. The lethality of this disease may reflect systemic viral dissemination, cytokine storm, or alveolar flooding due to inhibition of cellular sodium channels. The present circulating genotype Z is intrinsically resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. Prognosis may be improved by early treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor with good systemic drug levels, and post-exposure prophylaxis for health care workers is recommended. The role of immunomodulators and other modalities of therapy requires evaluation in randomised controlled trials, with prospective monitoring of the viral load and cytokine profiles in various clinical specimens. In view of the high fatality of the disease, a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions are recommended as long as resources allow despite the fact that the relative importance of these three modes in nosocomial transmission of avian influenza is still unknown.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical and epidemiological review of H5N1 infection in humans without direct genotype-phenotype experimental data.

Title: Virus-inducible reporter genes as a tool for detecting and quantifying influenza A virus replication.
Abstract: The use of influenza A virus-inducible reporter gene segments in detecting influenza A virus replication was investigated. The RNA polymerase I promoter/terminator cassette was used to express RNA transcripts encoding green fluorescence protein or firefly luciferase flanked by the untranslated regions of the influenza A/WSN/33 nucleoprotein (NP) segment. Reporter gene activity was detected after reconstitution of the influenza A virus polymerase complex from cDNA or after virus infection, and was influenza A virus-specific. Reporter gene activity could be detected as early as 6 h post-infection and was virus dose-dependent. Inhibitory effects of antibodies or amantadine could be detected and quantified rapidly, providing a means of not only identifying influenza A virus-specific replication, but also of determining the antigenic subtype as well as antiviral drug susceptibility. Induction of virus-specific reporter genes provides a rapid, sensitive method for detecting virus replication, quantifying virus titers and assessing antiviral sensitivity as well as antigenic subtype.

Title: Synthetic toll-like receptor 4 agonists stimulate innate resistance to infectious challenge.
Abstract: A compound family of synthetic lipid A mimetics (termed the aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates [AGPs]) was evaluated in murine infectious disease models of protection against challenge with Listeria monocytogenes and influenza virus. For the Listeria model, intravenous administration of AGPs was followed by intravenous bacterial challenge 24 h later. Spleens were harvested 2 days postchallenge for the enumeration of CFU. For the influenza virus model, mice were challenged with virus via the intranasal/intrapulmonary route 48 h after intranasal/intrapulmonary administration of AGPs. The severity of disease was assessed daily for 3 weeks following challenge. Several types of AGPs provided strong protection against influenza virus or Listeria challenge in wild-type mice, but they were inactive in the C3H/HeJ mouse, demonstrating the dependence of the AGPs on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling for the protective effect. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the activation of innate immune effectors by AGPs depends primarily on the lengths of the secondary acyl chains within the three acyl-oxy-acyl residues and also on the nature of the functional group attached to the aglycon component. We conclude that the administration of synthetic TLR4 agonists provides rapid pharmacologic induction of innate resistance to infectious challenge by two different pathogen classes, that this effect is mediated via TLR4, and that structural differences between AGPs can have dramatic effects on agonist activity in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates synthetic TLR4 agonists' effects on innate resistance but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Laboratory-based surveillance and molecular epidemiology of influenza virus in Taiwan.
Abstract: A laboratory-based surveillance network of 11 clinical virological laboratories for influenza viruses was established in Taiwan under the coordination of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Taiwan. From October 2000 to March 2004, 3,244 influenza viruses were isolated, including 1,969 influenza A and 1,275 influenza B viruses. The influenza infections usually occurred frequently in winter in the northern hemisphere. However, the influenza seasonality in Taiwan was not clear during the four seasons under investigation. For example, the influenza A viruses peaked during the winters of 2001, 2002, and 2003. However, some isolated peaks were also found in the summer and fall (June to November) of 2001 and 2002. An unusual peak of influenza B also occurred in the summer of 2002 (June to August). Phylogenetic analysis shows that influenza A isolates from the same year were often grouped together. However, influenza B isolates from the year 2002 clustered into different groups, and the data indicate that both B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like lineages of influenza B viruses were cocirculating. Sequence comparison of epidemic strains versus vaccine strains shows that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced. No clear seasonality of influenza reports in Taiwan occurred in contrast to other more continental regions.

Title: An unconventional NLS is critical for the nuclear import of the influenza A virus nucleoprotein and ribonucleoprotein.
Abstract: Replication of the RNAs of influenza virus occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. The nucleoprotein (NP) has been shown to be important for the import of the viral RNA into the nucleus and has been proposed to contain at least three different nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Here, an import assay in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to further define the contribution of these NLSs. Mutation of the unconventional NLS impaired the nuclear import of the NP. A peptide bearing the unconventional NLS could inhibit the nuclear import of the NP in this import assay and prevent the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction in a binding assay confirming the crucial role of this signal. Interestingly, a peptide containing the SV40 T antigen NLS was unable to inhibit the nuclear import of NP or the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction, suggesting that the NP and the SV40 T antigen do not share a common binding site on karyopherin alpha. We also investigated the question of which NLS(s) is/are necessary for the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to enter the nucleus. We found that the peptide containing the unconventional NLS efficiently inhibited the nuclear import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. This finding suggests that the unconventional NLS is the major signal necessary not only for the nuclear transport of free NP but also for the import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. Finally, viral replication could be specifically inhibited by a membrane-permeable peptide containing the unconventional NLS, confirming the crucial role of this signal during the replicative cycle of the virus.

Reason: The paper focuses on the role of an unconventional nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the nuclear import of influenza A virus nucleoprotein and ribonucleoprotein, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Microbial adaptation and change: avian influenza.
Abstract: The evolution of influenza is a continuing process involving viral and host factors. The increasing frequency of emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1, H7N3 and H7N7 influenza viruses and the panzootic spread of H9N2 influenza virus, all of which can be potentially transmitted to humans, are of great concern to both veterinary and human public health officials. The question is how soon the next pandemic will emerge. A convergence of factors, including the population densities of poultry, pigs and humans, are likely factors affecting the evolution of the virus. Highly concentrated poultry and pig farming, in conjunction with traditional live animal or 'wet' markets, provide optimal conditions for increased mutation, reassortment and recombination of influenza viruses. Strategies to reduce the evolution of influenza and the emergence of pandemics include the separation of species, increased biosecurity, the development of new vaccine strategies and better basic knowledge of the virus. More effective co-operation between scientists and veterinary and public health officials is required to achieve these goals.

Abstract: Natural interferon-producing cells (IPC) secrete type I IFN (IFN-alpha and -beta) in response to influenza virus. This process is independent of viral replication and is mediated by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). DC also express TLR7 but its function in DC response to influenza virus is unknown. To address this, we compared the DC and IPC responses to influenza virus and ssRNA oligoribonucleotides (ORN) that activate TLR7. When stimulated by ORN in vitro and in vivo, DC matured and produced inflammatory cytokines but not IFN-alpha. DC did secrete IFN-alpha in response to influenza virus. However, this response was independent of TLR7 signaling and required viral replication but not dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). We conclude that DC and IPC are hard-wired to secrete IFN-alpha via different pathways, reflecting their complementary but distinct roles in anti-viral immunity.

Title: Mitochondrial targeting sequence of the influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein and its function in mitochondria.
Abstract: The influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein predominantly localizes in the mitochondria of virus-infected cells. A series of cDNAs encoding N- and C-terminal deletion mutants and site-directed mutagenesis of the basic residues of PB1-F2 appended to 3xFLAG revealed the domain from residues 46 to 75 to be both necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. In addition, the subdomain residues 63-75 and both Lys73 and Arg75 are minimally required for mitochondrial localization. Transfection of untagged- and 3xFLAG tagged-PB1-F2 into Vero, HeLa and MDCK cells changed the mitochondrial morphology from a filamentous to a dotted structure and suppressed the inner-membrane potential.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies mitochondrial targeting of the PB1-F2 protein and its function but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: High permissivity of human HepG2 hepatoma cells for influenza viruses.
Abstract: Human HepG2 hepatoma cells are highly permissive for influenza virus type A and type B, even without the addition of trypsin, and they exhibit a marked cytopathic effect. This property greatly facilitates the primary isolation of influenza viruses. Virus replication was significantly reduced by the plasmin(ogen)-specific inhibitor tranexamic acid, and this suggests a potential role played by the plasminogen/tissue plasminogen activator complex at the surface of HepG2 cells. This might represent a new approach for study of the interrelations of this complex with influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports permissivity of HepG2 cells for influenza viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Neuraminidase inhibitor-rimantadine combinations exert additive and synergistic anti-influenza virus effects in MDCK cells.
Abstract: There is insufficient information about combination therapy with approved anti-influenza agents. We tested combinations that paired a neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor (zanamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, or peramivir) with rimantadine against infection of MDCK cells with H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A virus and characterized their mode of interaction. When reduction of extracellular virus was analyzed by individual regression models and three-dimensional representations of the data, all three combinations showed additive and synergistic effects with no cytotoxicity. Maximum synergy against A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) virus infection was observed with <2.5 microM rimantadine paired with low concentrations of NA inhibitors. All combinations reduced the extracellular yield of A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) influenza virus synergistically. However, our findings were different for the cell-associated virus yield. At some drug concentrations, the yield of cell-associated virus was inhibited antagonistically. Therefore, the method of analysis can be a crucial factor in evaluating the interactions of drugs with different mechanisms. We hypothesize that assays based on cell-associated virus yield may underestimate the efficacies of drug combinations that include an NA inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that regimens that combine NA inhibitors and rimantadine exert synergistic anti-influenza effects in vitro. These findings provide baseline information for therapeutic testing of the drug combinations in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies drug combination effects on influenza virus infection in vitro but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Stimulation of phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells through surface desialylation of macrophages by viral neuraminidase.
Abstract: Cells infected with influenza A virus undergo apoptosis and become susceptible to phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages. This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism underlying our previous finding that the activity of viral neuraminidase (NA) is required for efficient phagocytosis. Treatment of macrophages, not influenza virus-infected cells, with Arthrobacter ureafaciens NA or virus-infected cells expressing viral NA augmented the level of phagocytosis of virus-infected cells but not of latex beads or cells undergoing Fas-induced apoptosis. Oligosaccharides, including sialyllactose, bound to influenza virus-infected cells and inhibited phagocytosis by macrophages. These results indicate that surface desialylation of macrophages by influenza virus NA modulates the mode of association between macrophages and target virus-infected cells and stimulates phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of viral neuraminidase in phagocytosis of infected cells but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in human influenza viruses from Australia.
Abstract: Two hundred and forty-five human influenza A and B viruses isolated in Australia between 1996 and 2003 were tested for their sensitivity to the NA inhibitor drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir using a fluorescence-based neuraminidase inhibition assay. Based on mean IC50 values, influenza A viruses (with neuraminidase subtypes N1 and N2) were more sensitive to both the NA inhibitors than were influenza B strains. Influenza A viruses with a N1 subtype and influenza B strains both demonstrated a greater sensitivity to zanamivir than to oseltamivir carboxylate, whereas influenza A strains with a N2 subtype were more susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate. A comparison of IC50 values for viruses isolated before and after the release of the NA inhibitors in Australia, found there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of strains to either neuraminidase inhibitor and none of the isolates tested showed clinically significant resistance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on testing sensitivity of influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors and resistance surveillance, without explicit linking of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Measuring T cell immunity to influenza vaccination in children after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Abstract: Quantitative assessment of immunogen-specific T cell responses may provide a meaningful surrogate marker of functional immunity in patients following haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We developed a flow-cytometric assay to quantify antigen-specific T cell immunity to influenza-A and studied the T cell response to influenza vaccination in five children, 3-21 months post-HSCT. All patients showed an increase in influenza-A-specific CD4(+) immunity following vaccination while none had a detectable IgG response to the vaccine. This assay proved sufficiently sensitive to evaluate changes in T cell memory in immunocompromised individuals and could be used to better characterize post-HSCT immune reconstitution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study measures T cell immunity post-vaccination in children but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Streptococcus pyogenes capsule is required for adhesion of bacteria to virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells and lethal bacterial-viral superinfection.
Abstract: An apparent worldwide resurgence of invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections remains unexplained. However, we recently demonstrated in mice that when an otherwise nonlethal intranasal GAS infection is preceded by a nonlethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection, induction of lethal invasive GAS infections is often the result. In the present study, we established several isogenic mutants from a GAS isolate and evaluated several virulence factors as candidates responsible for the induction of invasive GAS infections. Disruption of the synthesis of the capsule, Mga, streptolysin O, streptolysin S, or streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B of GAS significantly reduced mortality among mice superinfected with IAV and a mutant. In addition, the number of GAS organisms adhering to IAV-infected alveolar epithelial cells was markedly reduced with the capsule-depleted mutant, although this was not the case with the other mutants. Wild-type GAS was found to bind directly to IAV particles, whereas the nonencapsulated mutant showed much less ability to bind. These results suggest that the capsule plays a key role in the invasion of host tissues by GAS following superinfection with IAV and GAS.
Relevant: False

Title: A DNA aptamer prevents influenza infection by blocking the receptor binding region of the viral hemagglutinin.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current means of control for influenza are based on prophylaxis by vaccines and on treatment by the available specific influenza neuraminidase inhibitor drugs. The approach taken in the present study is to prevent and/or ameliorate influenza infection by site-specific blocking of the viral binding to host cell receptors. We describe a novel oligonucleotide, known also as an aptamer, which has been designed to complement the receptor-binding region of the influenza hemagglutinin molecule. It was constructed by screening a DNA library and processing by the selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. We show that this DNA aptamer is indeed capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinin capacity of the virus, as well as in the prevention of viral infectivity in vitro, in tissue culture. Furthermore, it inhibits viral infection by different influenza strains in an animal model, as manifested by 90-99% reduction of virus burden in the lungs of treated mice. The mode of action of this aptamer is by blocking the binding of influenza virus to target cell receptors and consequently prevention of the virus invasion into the host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a DNA aptamer blocking viral hemagglutinin function but does not analyze viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Model suggesting that replication of influenza virus is regulated by stabilization of replicative intermediates.
Abstract: The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus is responsible for both transcription and replication of negative-sense viral RNA. It is thought that a "switching" mechanism regulates the transition between these activities. We demonstrate that, in the presence of preexisting viral RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein (NP), influenza A virus synthesizes both mRNA (transcription) and cRNA (replication) early in infection. We suggest that there may be no switch regulating the initiation of RNA synthesis and present a model suggesting that nascent cRNA is degraded by host cell nucleases unless it is stabilized by newly synthesized viral RNA polymerase and NP.
Relevant: False

Title: Influenza as a model system for studying the cross-species transfer and evolution of the SARS coronavirus.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) moved into humans from a reservoir species and subsequently caused an epidemic in its new host. We know little about the processes that allowed the cross-species transfer of this previously unknown virus. I discuss what we have learned about the movement of viruses into humans from studies of influenza A, both how it crossed from birds to humans and how it subsequently evolved within the human population. Starting with a brief review of severe acute respiratory syndrome to highlight the kinds of problems we face in learning about this viral disease, I then turn to influenza A, focusing on three topics. First, I present a reanalysis of data used to test the hypothesis that swine served as a "mixing vessel" or intermediate host in the transmission of avian influenza to humans during the 1918 "Spanish flu" pandemic. Second, I review studies of archived viruses from the three recent influenza pandemics. Third, I discuss current limitations in using molecular data to study the evolution of infectious disease. Although influenza A and SARS-CoV differ in many ways, our knowledge of influenza A may provide important clues about what limits or favours cross-species transfers and subsequent epidemics of newly emerging pathogens.

Title: Matrix gene of influenza a viruses isolated from wild aquatic birds: ecology and emergence of influenza a viruses.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during >18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic analysis of matrix genes in influenza viruses from wild birds without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Rac1 and PAK1 are upstream of IKK-epsilon and TBK-1 in the viral activation of interferon regulatory factor-3.
Abstract: The anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) response is initiated by the immediate induction of IFN beta, which is mainly controlled by the IFN-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). The signaling pathways mediating viral IRF-3 activation are only poorly defined. We show that the Rho GTPase Rac1 is activated upon virus infection and controls IRF-3 phosphorylation and activity. Inhibition of Rac1 leads to reduced IFN beta promoter activity and to enhanced virus production. As a downstream mediator of Rac signaling towards IRF-3, we have identified the kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK1). Furthermore, both Rac1 and PAK1 regulate the recently described IRF-3 activators, I kappa B kinase- and TANK-binding kinase-1, establishing a first canonical virus-induced IRF-3 activating pathway.
Relevant: False

Title: NF-kappaB-dependent induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas/FasL is crucial for efficient influenza virus propagation.
Abstract: Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is a hallmark of infections by viral pathogens including influenza viruses. Because gene expression of many proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines is controlled by this factor, the concept emerged that NF-kappaB and its upstream regulator IkappaB kinase are essential components of the innate antiviral immune response to infectious pathogens. In contrast to this common view we report here that NF-kappaB activity promotes efficient influenza virus production. On a molecular level this is due to NF-kappaB-dependent viral induction of the proapoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and FasL, which enhance virus propagation in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Thus, NF-kappaB acts both proapoptotically and provirally in the context of an influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses NF-kappaB's role in influenza virus propagation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes (specific mutations or sequences) to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza: a new pandemic threat?
Abstract: In December 2003, the largest outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 occurred among poultry in 8 Asian countries. A limited number of human H5N1 infections have been reported from Vietnam and Thailand, with a mortality rate approaching 70%. Deaths have occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The main presenting features were fever, pneumonitis, lymphopenia, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and coryza were absent. The H5N1 strains are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, which can be used for treatment and prophylaxis. The widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. The threat of a future pandemic from avian influenza is real. Adequate surveillance, development of vaccines, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic influenza planning are important. This article summarizes the current knowledge on avian influenza, including the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this emerging disease.

Title: Nuclear localization of avian polyomavirus structural protein VP1 is a prerequisite for the formation of virus-like particles.
Abstract: Virions of polyomaviruses consist of the major structural protein VP1, the minor structural proteins VP2 and VP3, and the viral genome associated with histones. An additional structural protein, VP4, is present in avian polyomavirus (APV) particles. As it had been reported that expression of APV VP1 in insect cells did not result in the formation of virus-like particles (VLP), the prerequisites for particle formation were analyzed. To this end, recombinant influenza viruses were created to (co)express the structural proteins of APV in chicken embryo cells, permissive for APV replication. VP1 expressed individually or coexpressed with VP4 did not result in VLP formation; both proteins (co)localized in the cytoplasm. Transport of VP1, or the VP1-VP4 complex, into the nucleus was facilitated by the coexpression of VP3 and resulted in the formation of VLP. Accordingly, a mutant APV VP1 carrying the N-terminal nuclear localization signal of simian virus 40 VP1 was transported to the nucleus and assembled into VLP. These results support a model of APV capsid assembly in which complexes of the structural proteins VP1, VP3 (or VP2), and VP4, formed within the cytoplasm, are transported to the nucleus using the nuclear localization signal of VP3 (or VP2); there, capsid formation is induced by the nuclear environment.
Relevant: False

Title: The utility of siRNA transcripts produced by RNA polymerase i in down regulating viral gene expression and replication of negative- and positive-strand RNA viruses.
Abstract: Short interfering double-stranded RNAs (siRNAs) expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase I promoter system were used to target gene expression of influenza A and West Nile virus. Decreased RNA and protein expression was induced in a sequence-specific manner-reducing sequence complementarity from 21 to 17 nucleotides abrogated the siRNA effect. Reduced M(2) expression resulted in a decrease in total and infectious influenza A virus production. WNV protein expression, genomic RNA, and infectious virus production were all dramatically reduced by siRNAs targeting two distinct viral sequences. The data demonstrate the utility of plasmid-driven siRNAs in regulating the expression of single viral genes, global viral gene expression, as a potential antiviral treatment, and as a genetic tool for viruses whose genomes are difficult to manipulate.

Abstract: Since the worst worldwide pandemic ever recorded — the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak that killed more than 20 million people — we have achieved significant advances in understanding the influenza virus. However, the fear of such a pandemic remains strong. For example, in 1997, when a lethal influenza variant afflicted eight people in Hong Kong, contributing to the death of six, officials feared the next wave had begun. They managed to solve the problem quickly, however, by destroying all of the poultry in Hong Kong[1].

Title: Children with respiratory disease associated with metapneumovirus in Hong Kong.
Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly discovered pathogen thought to be associated with respiratory disease. We report the results of a study of 587 children hospitalized with respiratory infection over a 13-month period. HMPV was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from 32 (5.5%) children by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HMPV infection was associated with clinical diagnoses of pneumonia (36%), asthma exacerbation (23%), or acute bronchiolitis (10%). When compared to those with respiratory syncytial virus infection, children with HMPV infection were older, and wheezing was more likely to represent asthma exacerbation rather than acute bronchiolitis. HMPV viral activity peaked during the spring-summer period in Hong Kong. Phylogenetically, all HMPV virus strains from Hong Kong belonged to one of the two genetic lineages previously described. HMPV contributed to 441.6 hospital admissions per 100,000 population <6 years of age.

Title: Promoted cell death of cells expressing human MxA by influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Interferon-inducible MxA protein plays a crucial role in cellular protection from RNA virus infection, although the protection mechanism is not completely clarified. Here, we examined effects of MxA on either uninfected or influenza virus A/PR/8/34-infected cells. Viral protein synthesis was reduced in cells expressing MxA. Under serum-starved conditions, not only viral but also cellular protein synthesis was reduced by expression of MxA. Of interest is that MxA promoted cell death induced by apoptotic stimuli as well as influenza virus infection. These results lead to a possibility that MxA suppresses multiplication of influenza virus by affecting cellular functions including the apoptotic pathway.

Title: In vitro characterization of A-315675, a highly potent inhibitor of A and B strain influenza virus neuraminidases and influenza virus replication.
Abstract: A-315675 is a novel, pyrrolidine-based compound that was evaluated in this study for its ability to inhibit A and B strain influenza virus neuraminidases in enzyme assays and influenza virus replication in cell culture. A-315675 effectively inhibited influenza A N1, N2, and N9 and B strain neuraminidases with inhibitor constant (K(i)) values between 0.024 and 0.31 nM. These values were comparable to or lower than the K(i) values measured for oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), zanamivir, and BCX-1812, except for the N1 enzymes that were found to be the most sensitive to BCX-1812. The time-dependent inhibition of neuraminidase catalytic activity observed with A-315675 is likely due to its very low rate of dissociation from the active site of neuraminidase. The half times for dissociation of A-315675 from B/Memphis/3/89 and A/Tokyo/3/67 (H3N2) influenza virus neuraminidases of 10 to 12 h are significantly slower than the half times measured for oseltamivir carboxylate (33 to 60 min). A-315675 inhibited the replication of several laboratory strains of influenza virus in cell culture with potencies that were comparable or superior to those for oseltamivir carboxylate and BCX-1812, except for the A/H1N1 viruses that were found to be two- to fourfold more susceptible to BCX-1812. A-315675 and oseltamivir carboxylate exhibited comparable potencies against a panel of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 influenza virus clinical isolates, but A-315675 was found to be significantly more potent than oseltamivir carboxylate against the B strain isolates. The favorable in vitro results relative to other clinically effective agents provide strong support for the further investigation of A-315675 as a potential therapy for influenza virus infections.

Title: Apical budding of a recombinant influenza A virus expressing a hemagglutinin protein with a basolateral localization signal.
Abstract: Influenza virions bud preferentially from the apical plasma membrane of infected epithelial cells, by enveloping viral nucleocapsids located in the cytosol with its viral integral membrane proteins, i.e., hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and M2 proteins, located at the plasma membrane. Because individually expressed HA, NA, and M2 proteins are targeted to the apical surface of the cell, guided by apical sorting signals in their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, it has been proposed that the polarized budding of influenza virions depends on the interaction of nucleocapsids and matrix proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and/or M2 proteins. Since HA is the major protein component of the viral envelope, its polarized surface delivery may be a major force that drives polarized viral budding. We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C560Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain. C560Y HA was expressed nonpolarly on the surface of infected MDCK cells. Interestingly, viral budding remained apical in C560Y virus-infected cells, and so did the location of NP and M1 proteins at late times of infection. These results are consistent with a model in which apical viral budding is a shared function of various viral components rather than a role of the major viral envelope glycoprotein HA.

Title: Apoptosis in cultured human fetal membrane cells infected with influenza virus.
Abstract: We investigated the induction of apoptosis in cultured human fetal membrane cells infected with influenza virus type A. We found that influenza virus yield in supernatants of primary cultured chorion and amnion cells prepared from human fetal membranes increased 6 h after infection. Chromosomal DNA was fragmented into oligonucleosomes at 48 h after influenza virus infection in chorion cells but not in mock-infected chorion cells, mock-infected amnion cells or influenza virus-infected amnion cells. The DNA fragmentation in influenza virus-infected chorion cells was evident at 24 h after infection and depended on the multiplicity of infection at 48 h. Incubating influenza virus-infected chorion cells with ribavirin, an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis, reduced the increase in virus yield and simultaneously blocked DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that both chorion and amnion cells become infected with influenza virus, but that influenza virus infection induces apoptosis in chorion, but not typical apoptosis characterized by DNA ladder formation in amnion cells. We further observed that influenza virus replication is associated with the induction of apoptosis.
Relevant: False

Title: Zanamivir: from drug design to the clinic.
Abstract: The development of the neuraminidase inhibitors has revolutionized the management options for influenza. Zanamivir was the first such inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of influenza in humans. It is delivered by inhalation to the respiratory tract, which is the site of viral replication, in order to ensure immediate antiviral activity. Early treatment with zanamivir in clinical trials rapidly reduced the severity and duration of influenza symptoms and associated complications. Furthermore, chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir was shown to be effective in the prevention of influenza illness. To date, there is no evidence for the emergence of clinically significant zanamivir-resistant isolates. In conclusion, zanamivir offers a useful complementary strategy to vaccination in the effective management of influenza.

Title: Perspectives on antiviral use during pandemic influenza.
Abstract: Antiviral agents could potentially play a major role in the initial response to pandemic influenza, particularly with the likelihood that an effective vaccine is unavailable, by reducing morbidity and mortality. The M2 inhibitors are partially effective for chemoprophylaxis of pandemic influenza and evidence from studies of interpandemic influenza indicate that the neuraminidase inhibitors would be effective in prevention. In addition to the symptom benefit observed with M2 inhibitor treatment, early therapeutic use of neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of lower respiratory complications. Clinical pharmacology and adverse drug effect profiles indicate that the neuraminidase inhibitors and rimantadine are preferable to amantadine with regard to the need for individual prescribing and tolerance monitoring. Transmission of drug-resistant virus could substantially limit the effectiveness of M2 inhibitors and the possibility exists for primary M2 inhibitor resistance in a pandemic strain. The frequency of resistance emergence is lower with neuraminidase inhibitors and mathematical modelling studies indicate that the reduced transmissibility of drug-resistant virus observed with neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant variants would lead to negligible community spread of such variants. Thus, there are antiviral drugs currently available that hold considerable promise for response to pandemic influenza before a vaccine is available, although considerable work remains in realizing this potential. Markedly increasing the quantity of available antiviral agents through mechanisms such as stockpiling, educating health care providers and the public and developing effective means of rapid distribution to those in need are essential in developing an effective response, but remain currently unresolved problems.

Title: Tumor necrosis factor alpha exerts powerful anti-influenza virus effects in lung epithelial cells.
Abstract: Previous studies have associated influenza virus-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), with influenza pathogenesis in the human respiratory tract and have suggested that alpha and beta interferons are the first cytokines recruited to counteract such infection. However, we report here that TNF-alpha has powerful anti-influenza virus activity. When infected with influenza virus, cultured porcine lung epithelial cells expressed TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of TNF-alpha was induced only by replicating virus. TNF-alpha showed strong antiviral activity against avian, swine, and human influenza viruses, and the antiviral effect of TNF-alpha was greater than that of gamma or alpha interferon. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha serves as the first line of defense against influenza virus infection in the natural host.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral effects of TNF-alpha on influenza virus infection but does not discuss viral genotypes or link specific viral genetic variations to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibitory role of neutrophils on influenza virus multiplication in the lungs of mice.
Abstract: The protective role of neutrophils on intranasal infection of influenza virus was investigated in 3 strains of tumor-bearing mice with neutrophilic leukocytosis. In vitro multiplication of influenza virus was inhibited by neutrophils from both normal and tumor-bearing mice, and the inhibitory effect of neutrophils was augmented by an addition of fMLP to the culture. Pulmonary virus infectivities in the early phase after infection decreased in such ICR and BALB/c mice, and virus elimination in the late phase was accelerated in the ICR mice. However, no decrease in pulmonary virus infectivity was observed in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Intranasal administration of fMLP into normal and tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice after infection significantly inhibited the virus propagation in the lungs. The decrease in neutrophil infiltration into the lung in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice was confirmed from histological observations of the lung and lung lavage after infection and from analysis of the neutrophil chemotactic activity induced by fMLP. This might be responsible for the high level of pulmonary virus titer in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Phagocytic activities of alveolar macrophages and productions of neutralizing antibody were suppressed in the 3 strains of tumor-bearing mice. These observations indicated that neutrophils could be significant effector cells as a host defense mechanism against influenza virus infection in vivo, and infiltration and functional activation of neutrophils could play a significant role in virus elimination from the infected site. Furthermore, the inhibition of virus propagation by neutrophils in vitro was almost completely abrogated by an addition of ZnSO4, suggesting that calprotectin could inhibit influenza virus multiplication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of neutrophils in inhibiting influenza virus multiplication but does not analyze viral genotypes or link viral genetic variations to phenotypes.

Title: Functional analysis of the influenza A virus cRNA promoter and construction of an ambisense transcription system.
Abstract: While influenza A viral RNA is known to act as a template for the synthesis of both viral mRNA and complementary cRNA, the latter has been observed so far only to function as an intermediate in replication and give rise to progeny vRNA molecules. Here it is shown that the cRNA promoter is also capable of initiating viral mRNA synthesis, similar to vRNA-promoted transcription adhering to the cap-snatching mode of primer recruitment. Detection of cRNA promoted transcription required an inversion of the reporter gene coding sequence plus relocation of the viral polyadenylation signal. Construction of cRNA promoter variants through RNA polymerase I reverse genetics allowed us to determine the RNA polymerase-associated, base-paired conformation in a reporter gene read-out system. It again turned out to adhere to the "corkscrew" model, similar, but slightly different in its binding interactions from the corresponding vRNA conformation. The observation of two transcription reactions, initiated in either direction from influenza vRNA and cRNA template molecules, allowed us to construct bicistronic, ambisense RNA molecules for simultaneous expression of two proteins from a single segment of viral RNA.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on functional analysis of viral RNA promoters and transcription mechanisms without linking viral genetic variations to phenotypic traits.

Title: The involvement of a stress-activated pathway in equine influenza virus-mediated apoptosis.
Abstract: We have shown elsewhere that equine-2 influenza virus (EIV; subtype H3N8) induced pronounced cell death in infected cells through apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay and a combined TUNEL and immunostaining scheme. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of EIV-mediated cytotoxicity on a permissive mammalian epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. EIV infection increased the cellular levels of oxidative stress and c-Jun/AP-1 protein (which is known to be affected by oxidative stress), as well as its DNA binding activity. Increased production of TGF-beta1, an inducer of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) activation, was also detected in EIV-infected MDCK cells. It has been reported that TGF-beta may initiate a signaling cascade leading to JNK/SAPK activation. Addition of c-Jun antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), JNK/SAPK inhibitor carvedilol, or TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody effectively blocked c-Jun/AP-1 upregulation and TGF-beta1 production mediated by EIV infection. These treatments also attenuated EIV-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) and apoptosis. Our results suggest that a stress-activated pathway is involved in apoptosis mediated by EIV infection. It is likely that EIV infection turns on the JNK/SAPK cascade, which modulates the activity of apoptosis-promoting regulatory factor c-Jun/AP-1 and epithelial growth inhibitory cytokine TGF-beta.

Title: Expression of the DX5 antigen on CD8+ T cells is associated with activation and subsequent cell death or memory during influenza virus infection.
Abstract: The antigen recognized by the DX5 antibody (DX5 antigen) is expressed on all murine NK cells. In the present study we found that a proportion of CD8+ T cells (approximately 5%) also express the DX5 antigen in uninfected mice, and that numbers of CD8+ T cells expressing DX5 are significantly higher in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice representing up to 50% of all CD8+ T cells on day 10 post infection. The expression of the DX5 antigen on CD8+ T cells was associated with a memory phenotype in uninfected C57BL/6 mice and with an activation phenotype during influenza virus infection. Interestingly, when lymphocytes were isolated from lungs of influenza virus-infected mice on day 10 post infection and adoptively transferred into recombination activating gene-1 (RAG1)-deficient mice, CD8+DX5+ cells could not be recovered from the recipient mice 2 days later. Moreover, CD8+DX5+ cells were not detected when lung cells were removed from day 10 influenza virus-infected mice and cultured in vitro for 2 days. However, CD8+DX5+ cells could be detected when apoptosis inhibitors were added to these cultures, suggesting that the CD8+DX5+ cells underwent apoptosis during cell culture. Furthermore, almost all DX5 expressing CD8+ cells from lungs of mice on day 10 post influenza virus infection stained positively with Annexin-V. Taken together, the data suggest that CD8+ T cells expressing DX5 are associated with an activation/memory phenotype and are biased towards apoptosis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on immune cell phenotypes (DX5 antigen expression on CD8+ T cells) during influenza infection, without linking viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus-induced AP-1-dependent gene expression requires activation of the JNK signaling pathway.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection of cells results in the induction of a variety of antiviral cytokines, including those that are regulated by transcription factors of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) family. Here we show that influenza virus infection induces AP-1-dependent gene expression in productively infected cells but not in cells that do not support viral replication. Among the AP-1 factors identified to bind to their cognate DNA element during viral infections of Madin-Darby canine kidney and U937 cells are those that are regulated via phosphorylation by JNKs. Accordingly, we observed that induction of AP-1-dependent gene expression correlates with a strong activation of JNK in permissive cells, which appears to be caused by viral RNA accumulation during replication. Blockade of JNK signaling at several levels of the cascade by transient expression of dominant negative kinase mutants and inhibitory proteins resulted in inhibition of virus-induced JNK activation, reduced AP-1 activity, and impaired transactivation of the IFN-beta promoter. Virus yields from transfected and infected cells in which JNK signaling was inhibited were higher compared with the levels from control cells. Therefore, we conclude that virus-induced activation of JNK and AP-1 is part of the innate antiviral response of the cell.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host cell signaling pathways (JNK and AP-1) activated by influenza virus infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and viral phenotypes.

Title: Asialoglycoprotein receptors on rat dendritic cells: possible roles for binding with Kupffer cells and ingesting virus particles.
Abstract: Rat dendritic cells selectively bind to Kupffer cells in vitro. The present study aimed to reveal adhesion molecules on dendritic cells and their roles in the host defense system. The in situ binding assay to examine the effects of pretreatment of dendritic cells with various kinds of monosaccharides suggested that N-acetylgalactosamine was necessary for the binding of dendritic cells to Kupffer cells. This binding was also attenuated when dendritic cells were injected into an ex vivo liver perfusion circuit together with N-acetyl-galactosamine. It was further shown that the majority of rat lymph dendritic cells and some interdigitating dendritic cells in the lymph nodes possessed asialoglycoprotein receptors specific for N-acetylgalactosamine/galactose as detected by immunostaining. Lymph dendritic cells could ingest virus particles in vitro, even though these cells showed no phagocytic activity for latex particles. The results indicate that rat dendritic cells possess asialoglycoprotein receptors which are probably utilized to recognize Kupffer cells for their recruitment to the liver and possibly to recognize virus particles prior to phagocytosis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies asialoglycoprotein receptors on rat dendritic cells and their role in virus particle ingestion, focusing on host cell biology rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A novel approach to antigen-specific deletion of CTL with minimal cellular activation using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I/peptide complex.
Abstract: In this study, we have compared the effector functions and fate of a number of human CTL clones in vitro or ex vivo following contact with variant peptides presented either on the cell surface or in a soluble multimeric format. In the presence of CD8 coreceptor binding, there is a good correlation between TCR signaling, killing of the targets, and FasL-mediated CTL apoptosis. Blocking CD8 binding using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I results in much reduced signaling and reduced killing of the targets. Surprisingly, however, FasL expression is induced to a similar degree on these CTLs, and apoptosis of CTL is unaffected. The ability to divorce these events may allow the deletion of antigen-specific and pathological CTL populations without the deleterious effects induced by full CTL activation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on CTL effector functions and fate in response to antigen presentation, without linking viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: Immunity to influenza A H9N2 viruses induced by infection and vaccination.
Abstract: Avian influenza A H9N2 viruses are widespread among domestic poultry and were recently isolated from humans with respiratory illness in China. Two antigenically and genetically distinct groups of H9N2 viruses (G1 and G9) are prevalent in China. To evaluate a strategy for vaccination, we compared G1 and G9 viruses for their relative immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy. Infection of BALB/c mice with representative viruses of either group protected against subsequent challenge with the homologous or heterologous H9N2 virus in the absence of detectable cross-reactive serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody. Mice injected intramuscularly with inactivated G1 whole virus vaccine were completely protected from challenge with either H9N2 virus. In contrast, mice administered inactivated G9 vaccine were only partially protected against heterologous challenge with the G1 virus. These results have implications for the development of human vaccines against H9N2 viruses, a priority for pandemic preparedness.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates immunogenicity and cross-protection of different H9N2 virus groups but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: A screen of random sequences for those that alter the trafficking of the influenza virus hemagglutinin in vivo.
Abstract: In order to determine if the sequence patterns known to specify internalization represent the majority of possible internalization signals, we identified random sequences capable of causing a reporter protein to be internalized at least several-fold faster than the rate of non-selective internalization of membrane by clathrin-coated pits. A library of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, bearing short random sequences in place of the wild-type cytoplasmic domain, was prepared in recombinant SV40 virus. The library was expressed and screened for HAs that could internalize anti-HA antibody from the medium. The cytoplasmic sequences of the selected proteins were determined. From a small sample of sequences we detected several that did not resemble those previously identified. The known internalization signals must represent only a subset of the sequences that can serve as internalization signals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study screens random sequences for their effect on hemagglutinin trafficking but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes in a natural or clinical context.

Title: In vivo influenza virus-inhibitory effects of the cyclopentane neuraminidase inhibitor RJW-270201.
Abstract: The cyclopentane influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor RWJ-270201 was evaluated against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1), A/Shangdong/09/93 (H3N2), A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2), and B/Hong Kong/05/72 virus infections in mice. Treatment was by oral gavage twice daily for 5 days beginning 4 h pre-virus exposure. The influenza virus inhibitor oseltamivir was run in parallel, and ribavirin was included in studies with the A/Shangdong and B/Hong Kong viruses. RWJ-270201 was inhibitory to all infections using doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day. Oseltamivir was generally up to 10-fold less effective than RWJ-270201. Ribavirin was also inhibitory but was less tolerated by the mice at the 75-mg/kg/day dose used. Disease-inhibitory effects included prevention of death, lessening of decline of arterial oxygen saturation, inhibition of lung consolidation, and reduction in lung virus titers. RWJ-270201 and oseltamivir, at doses of 10 and 1 mg/kg/day each, were compared with regard to their effects on daily lung parameters in influenza A/Shangdong/09/93 virus-infected mice. Maximum virus titer inhibition was seen on day 1, with RWJ-270201 exhibiting the greater inhibitory effect, a titer reduction of >10(4) cell culture 50% infective doses (CCID(50))/g. By day 8, the lung virus titers in mice treated with RWJ-270201 had declined to 10(1.2) CCID(50)/g, whereas titers from oseltamivir-treated animals were >10(3) CCID(50)/g. Mean lung consolidation was also higher in the oseltamivir-treated animals on day 8. Both neuraminidase inhibitors were well tolerated by the mice. RWJ-270201 was nontoxic at doses as high as 1,000 mg/kg/day. These data indicate potential for the oral use of RWJ-270201 in the treatment of influenza virus infections in humans.

Title: Cyclopentane neuraminidase inhibitors with potent in vitro anti-influenza virus activities.
Abstract: A novel series of cyclopentane derivatives have been found to exhibit potent and selective inhibitory effects on influenza virus neuraminidase. These compounds, designated RWJ-270201, BCX-1827, BCX-1898, and BCX-1923, were tested in parallel with zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate against a spectrum of influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1) and influenza B viruses in MDCK cells. Inhibition of viral cytopathic effect ascertained visually and by neutral red dye uptake was used, with 50% effective (virus-inhibitory) concentrations (EC(50)) determined. Against the H1N1 viruses A/Bayern/07/95, A/Beijing/262/95, A/PR/8/34, and A/Texas/36/91, EC(50)s (determined by neutral red assay) of the novel compounds were < or =1.5 microM. Twelve strains of H3N2 and two strains of avian H5N1 viruses were inhibited at <0.3 microM. Influenza B/Beijing/184/93 and B/Harbin/07/94 viruses were inhibited at <0.2 microM, with three other B virus strains inhibited at 0.8 to 8 microM. The novel inhibitors were comparable in potency to (or slightly more potent than) zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. No cytotoxicity was seen with the compounds at concentrations of < or =1 mM in cell proliferation assays. The antiviral activity of RWJ-270201, chosen for clinical development, was studied in greater detail. Its potency and that of oseltamivir carboxylate decreased with increasing multiplicity of virus infection. Time-of-addition studies indicated that treatment with either compound needed to begin 0 to 12 h after virus exposure for optimal activity. Exposure of cells to RWJ-270201 caused most of the virus to remain cell associated, with extracellular virus decreasing in a concentration-dependent manner. This is consistent with its effect as a neuraminidase inhibitor. RWJ-270201 shows promise in the treatment of human influenza virus infections.

Title: Influenza virus and rhinovirus-related otitis media: potential for antiviral intervention.
Abstract: Adults frequently develop eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear pressure (MEP) abnormalities during natural and experimental influenza and human rhinovirus (HRV) infections. Oral rimantadine treatment did not reduce the otologic manifestations of experimental influenza in adults or natural influenza in children. However, intranasal zanamivir and oral oseltamivir significantly reduced MEP abnormalities during experimental influenza in adults, and oseltamivir treatment appears to reduce the likelihood of otitis media in children with acute influenza. Investigational anti-HRV agents, including intranasal tremacamra, intranasal AG7088, and oral pleconaril, warrant study in this regard. Depending on the virus, early antiviral therapy has the potential to impact the risk of otitis media following respiratory tract infections.

Title: The role of alpha/beta and gamma interferons in development of immunity to influenza A virus in mice.
Abstract: During influenza virus infection innate and adaptive immune defenses are activated to eliminate the virus and thereby bring about recovery from illness. Both arms of the adaptive immune system, antibody neutralization of free virus and termination of intracellular virus replication by antiviral cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), play pivotal roles in virus elimination and protection from disease. Innate cytokine responses, such as alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) or IFN-gamma, can have roles in determining the rate of virus replication in the initial stages of infection and in shaping the initial inflammatory and downstream adaptive immune responses. The effect of these cytokines on the replication of pneumotropic influenza A virus in the respiratory tract and in the regulation of adaptive antiviral immunity was examined after intranasal infection of mice with null mutations in receptors for IFN-alpha/beta, IFN-gamma, and both IFNs. Virus titers in the lungs of mice unable to respond to IFNs were not significantly different from congenic controls for both primary and secondary infection. Likewise the mice were comparably susceptible to X31 (H3N2) influenza virus infection. No significant disruption to the development of normal antiviral CTL or antibody responses was observed. In contrast, mice bearing the disrupted IFN-alpha/beta receptor exhibited accelerated kinetics and significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibody activity during primary or secondary heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. Thus, these observations reveal no significant contribution for IFN-controlled pathways in shaping acute or memory T-cell responses to pneumotropic influenza virus infection but do indicate some role for IFN-alpha/beta in the regulation of antibody responses. Recognizing the pivotal role of CTLs and antibody in virus clearance, it is reasonable to assume a redundancy in IFN-mediated antiviral effects in pulmonary influenza. However, IFN-alpha/beta seems to be a valid factor in determining tissue tropism and replicative rates of highly virulent influenza virus strains as reported previously by others, and this aspect is discussed here.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of interferons in immunity to influenza virus in mice, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Pandemic threat posed by avian influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Influenza pandemics, defined as global outbreaks of the disease due to viruses with new antigenic subtypes, have exacted high death tolls from human populations. The last two pandemics were caused by hybrid viruses, or reassortants, that harbored a combination of avian and human viral genes. Avian influenza viruses are therefore key contributors to the emergence of human influenza pandemics. In 1997, an H5N1 influenza virus was directly transmitted from birds in live poultry markets in Hong Kong to humans. Eighteen people were infected in this outbreak, six of whom died. This avian virus exhibited high virulence in both avian and mammalian species, causing systemic infection in both chickens and mice. Subsequently, another avian virus with the H9N2 subtype was directly transmitted from birds to humans in Hong Kong. Interestingly, the genes encoding the internal proteins of the H9N2 virus are genetically highly related to those of the H5N1 virus, suggesting a unique property of these gene products. The identification of avian viruses in humans underscores the potential of these and similar strains to produce devastating influenza outbreaks in major population centers. Although highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses had been identified before the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, their devastating effects had been confined to poultry. With the Hong Kong outbreak, it became clear that the virulence potential of these viruses extended to humans.

Title: Avian influenza viruses infecting humans.
Abstract: Avian species, particularly waterfowl, are the natural hosts of influenza A viruses. Influenza viruses bearing each of the 15 hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase subtypes infect birds and serve as a reservoir from which influenza viruses or genes are introduced into the human population. Viruses with novel hemagglutinin genes derived from avian influenza viruses, with or without other accompanying avian influenza virus genes, have the potential for pandemic spread when the human population lacks protective immunity against the new hemagglutinin. Avian influenza viruses were thought to be limited in their ability to directly infect humans until 1997, when 18 human infections with avian influenza H5N1 viruses occurred in Hong Kong. In 1999, two human infections with avian influenza H9N2 viruses were also identified in Hong Kong. These events established that avian viruses could infect humans without acquiring human influenza genes by reassortment in an intermediate host and highlighted challenges associated with the detection of human immune responses to avian influenza viruses and the development of appropriate vaccines.

Title: Virus-induced maturation and activation of autoreactive memory B cells.
Abstract: We have examined B cell populations that participate in distinct phases of the immune response to the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 hemagglutinin (HA) for their susceptibility to negative selection in mice that express the HA as a neo-self-antigen (HA104 mice). We demonstrated previously that specificity for the neo-self-HA causes a population of immunoglobulin G antibody-secreting cells, which dominate the primary response to virus immunization in BALB/c mice, to be negatively selected in HA104 mice. We find here that in contrast to these primary response B cells, HA-specific memory response B cells developed equivalently in HA104 and nontransgenic (BALB/c) mice. Indeed, there was no indication that HA-specific B cells were negatively selected during memory formation in influenza virus-immunized HA104 mice, even though the neo-self-HA can be recognized by memory B cells. Furthermore, HA-specific autoantibodies were induced in the absence of virus immunization by mating HA104 mice with mice transgenic for a CD4(+) HA-specific T cell receptor. These findings indicate that specificity for a self-antigen does not prevent the maturation of autoreactive B cells in the germinal center pathway. Rather, the availability of CD4(+) T cell help may play a crucial role in regulating autoantibody responses to the HA in HA104 mice.

Title: Effects of passage history and sampling bias on phylogenetic reconstruction of human influenza A evolution.
Abstract: In this paper we determine the extent to which host-mediated mutations and a known sampling bias affect evolutionary studies of human influenza A. Previous phylogenetic reconstruction of influenza A (H3N2) evolution using the hemagglutinin gene revealed an excess of nonsilent substitutions assigned to the terminal branches of the tree. We investigate two hypotheses to explain this observation. The first hypothesis is that the excess reflects mutations that were either not present or were at low frequency in the viral sample isolated from its human host, and that these mutations increased in frequency during passage of the virus in embryonated eggs. A set of 22 codons known to undergo such "host-mediated" mutations showed a significant excess of mutations assigned to branches attaching sequences from egg-cultured (as opposed to cell-cultured) isolates to the tree. Our second hypothesis is that the remaining excess results from sampling bias. Influenza surveillance is purposefully biased toward sequencing antigenically dissimilar strains in an effort to identify new variants that may signal the need to update the vaccine. This bias produces an excess of mutations assigned to terminal branches simply because an isolate with no close relatives is by definition attached to the tree by a relatively long branch. Simulations show that the magnitude of excess mutations we observed in the hemagglutinin tree is consistent with expectations based on our sampling protocol. Sampling bias does not affect inferences about evolution drawn from phylogenetic analyses. However, if possible, the excess caused by host-mediated mutations should be removed from studies of the evolution of influenza viruses as they replicate in their human hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the effects of passage history and sampling bias on phylogenetic reconstruction of influenza A evolution, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Early stages of influenza virus entry into Mv-1 lung cells: involvement of dynamin.
Abstract: Viruses generally have one of two mechanisms for entry and uncoating. They can enter the cell either by endocytosis or by direct fusion at the plasma membrane. We have established a novel mink lung (Mv-1) cell line that expresses a dominant-interfering form of dynamin-1 (K44A) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element and studied the early events in influenza infection using these cells. We found that influenza virus binds equally to both induced and uninduced cells, but in K44A-expressing cells, electron microscopy showed viruses trapped in deep coated pits and irregular-shaped tubular structures that contain discrete coated regions. We also show by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy that entry of incoming virus into the nucleus is blocked in K44A-expressing cells. Virus replication was assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy and was strongly inhibited at both early and late times postinfection in K44A-expressing cells. Virus infectivity was inhibited by approximately 2 log units in cells expressing K44A dynamin when analyzed by influenza plaque assay. Overall these data show that dynamin is required for efficient influenza virus entry, presumably due to its function in release of vesicles from coated pits.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of dynamin in influenza virus entry into cells, without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Alpha/beta interferons potentiate virus-induced apoptosis through activation of the FADD/Caspase-8 death signaling pathway.
Abstract: Interferon (IFN) mediates its antiviral effects by inducing a number of responsive genes, including the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase, PKR. Here we report that inducible overexpression of functional PKR in murine fibroblasts sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by influenza virus, while in contrast, cells expressing a dominant-negative variant of PKR were completely resistant. We determined that the mechanism of influenza virus-induced apoptosis involved death signaling through FADD/caspase-8 activation, while other viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SNV) did not significantly provoke PKR-mediated apoptosis but did induce cytolysis of fibroblasts via activation of caspase-9. Significantly, treatment with IFN-alpha/beta greatly sensitized the fibroblasts to FADD-dependent apoptosis in response to dsRNA treatment or influenza virus infection but completely protected the cells against VSV and SNV replication in the absence of any cellular destruction. The mechanism by which IFN increases the cells' susceptibility to lysis by dsRNA or certain virus infection is by priming cells to FADD-dependent apoptosis, possibly by regulating the activity of the death-induced signaling complex (DISC). Conversely, IFN is also able to prevent the replication of viruses such as VSV that avoid triggering FADD-mediated DISC activity, by noncytopathic mechanisms, thus preventing destruction of the cell.

Abstract: Cytotoxic T (Tc)-cell responses against influenza virus infection in BALB/c (H-2d) mice are dominated by Tc clones reactive to the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Here, we report investigations using recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I H-2Kd molecules differing by a single amino acid from glutamine (wild-type, Kdw) to histidine (mutant, Kdm) at position 114 located in the floor of the peptide-binding groove. Influenza-infected target cells expressing Kdw were strongly lysed by Kd-restricted Tc cells against A/WSN influenza virus or the immunodominant peptide of viral NP (NPP147-155), whereas infected Kdm-expressing targets gave little or no lysis, respectively, thus showing the immunodominance of NPP147-155. Kdm-expressing target cells saturated with synthetic NPP147-155 (10-5 M) were lysed similarly to Kdw-expressing targets by NPP147-155-specific Tc cells. Thus the defect in influenza-infected Kdm-expressing targets was quantitative; insufficient Kdm-peptide complexes were expressed. Tc-cell responses against four other viruses or alloantigens showed no effect of Kdm. When peptide transport-defective cells were infected with VV-Kdw or VV-Kdm and co-infected with a recombinant VV encoding an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted viral peptide, two influenza haemaglutinin peptides caused higher expression of Kdw than NPP147-155 indicating their higher affinity for Kdw. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that immunodominance in the anti-influenza response reflects high affinity of the immunodominant peptide, but are consistent with skewing of the Tc-cell receptor repertoire.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies MHC class I peptide affinity and immunodominance, focusing on host immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Inhibition of influenza virus replication by nitric oxide.
Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced pneumonia in mouse models. Here we show that replication of influenza A and B viruses in Mabin Darby canine kidney cells is severely impaired by the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Reduction of productively infected cells and virus production proved to correlate with inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, indicating that NO affects an early step in the replication cycle of influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates nitric oxide inhibition of influenza virus replication, focusing on antiviral effects rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Insufficient resistance of trehalose-6,6-dimycolate-treated T-cell receptor delta gene mutant (TCR delta-/-) mice against influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Normal mice inoculated intravenously with 50 microg trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate, a glycolipid component of the cell wall of Mycobacterium, in an oil-in-water emulsion (TDM emulsion) acquired a high resistance to intranasal lethal infection of an influenza virus. In contrast, TDM emulsion-treated T-cell receptor delta gene mutant (TCR delta-/-) mice acquired insufficient resistance against the lethal influenza virus infection. The patterns of insufficient resistance were identical to the results obtained previously with mice which were depleted of T-lymphocytes bearing gammadelta T-cell receptors (gammadelta T-cells) by in vivo administration of anti-gammadelta T-cell receptor monoclonal antibody (Hoq et al, J. Gen. Virol. 78: 1597-1603, 1997). These results strongly suggest that the gammadelta T-cells play an important non-specific role in resistance against influenza virus infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses resistance to influenza virus infection in mutant mice but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Differential production of proinflammatory cytokines in the pig lung during different respiratory virus infections: correlations with pathogenicity.
Abstract: The acute stages of infection with swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine reproductive-respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were shown to differ in terms of clinical and lung inflammatory effects and proinflammatory cytokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived pigs were inoculated intratracheally with one of the three viruses. SIV infection was followed within 1 day post inoculation (d PI) by characteristic respiratory and general signs, and excessive lung epithelial desquamation and neutrophil infiltration (38 to 56 per cent of BAL cells at 1 d PI vs 0 to 1 per cent in controls). High concentrations of bioactive interferon-alpha (IFN -alpha), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF -alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL -1) coincided with peak symptoms and neutrophil infiltration. PRCV infection was asymptomatic and produced a mild bronchointerstitial pneumonitis and neutrophil infiltration (13 to 22 per cent of BAL cells at 4 d PI). IFN -alpha titres parallelled those found during SIV infection, TNF -alpha was negligible and IL -1 undetectable. PRRSV infection induced anorexia and lethargy between 3 and 5 d PI. There was marked infiltration with mononuclear cells in alveolar septa and BAL fluids between 7 and 10 d PI, while neutrophils remained at less than 11 per cent of BAL cells at any time. IL -1 was produced from three throughout 10 d PI, while IFN -alpha production was minimal and TNF -alpha undetectable. These data strongly suggest that proinflammatory cytokines can be important mediators of viral respiratory disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on cytokine production during different viral infections without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cellular proteinases trigger the infectivity of the influenza A and Sendai viruses.
Abstract: It has been proposed that the pathogenicity of the influenza and Sendai virus is primarily determined by host cellular proteases that activate viral infectivity. We isolated trypsin-type serine proteases from rat lungs, candidates for the processing proteases of viral envelope glycoproteins, such as tryptase Clara localized in the Clara cells of the bronchial epithelium and mini-plasmin. These enzymes specifically cleave the precursor of fusion glycoprotein HA of influenza virus at Arg325, and the F0 of Sendai virus at Arg116 in the consensus cleavage motif, Gln(Glu)-X-Arg, resulting in the induction of infectivity of these viruses. Proteolytic activation of viruses by these enzymes occurs extracellularly, probably on the surface and/or in the lumen of the respiratory tract. On the other hand, we isolated two compounds from human bronchial lavage, which inhibit the activity of tryptase Clara. One was a mucus protease inhibitor and the other was a pulmonary surfactant. These compounds inhibited multiple cycles of virus replication in vitro and in vivo, but did not themselves affect the hemagglutination and the infectivity of the virus. Administration of these compounds in the airway may be useful for preventing and treating infection with influenza virus and Sendai virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: Discusses host proteases activating viral infectivity but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Importance of the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif of membrane cofactor protein for basolateral sorting and endocytosis. Positive and negative modulation by signals inside and outside the cytoplasmic tail.
Abstract: Membrane cofactor protein (MCP), a widely distributed complement regulatory protein, is expressed on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells, and it is not endocytosed. The carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (FTSL) is required for polarized surface expression. The ability of this tetrapeptide to serve as an autonomous sorting signal has been analyzed by adding this sequence motif to the C terminus of an apical membrane protein, the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). The recombinant protein HA-FTSL retained the apical localization of the parental HA protein. Substitution of the complete cytoplasmic tail of MCP for the cytoplasmic tail of HA resulted in the targeting of the chimeric protein (HA/MCP) to the basolateral surface suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif is a weak sorting signal that requires additional targeting information from the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of MCP for redirecting an apical protein to the basolateral membrane domain. In contrast to the native HA, the HA-FTSL protein was subject to endocytosis. The basolateral HA/MCP was also found to be internalized and thus differed from the basolateral MCP. This result suggests that the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif serves as an internalization signal and that in native MCP sorting information outside the cytoplasmic tail counteracts this endocytosis signal. Substitution of a tyrosine for the phenylalanine dramatically increased the internalization with most of the HA-YTSL protein being present intracellularly. Our results are consistent with the view that the interplay of multiple sorting signals and the modification of a well known targeting signal (YTSL) by amino acid exchange (FTSL) determine the constitutive expression of MCP on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on cellular protein sorting signals and endocytosis, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Recruitment of apoptotic cysteine proteases (caspases) in influenza virus-induced cell death.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection induces apoptosis in cultured cells with an augmented expression of Fas (APO-1/CD95). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases structurally related to interleukin-1-beta-converting enzyme (ICE), play crucial roles in apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including Fas. However, activation of the caspase-cascade seems to be different in various pathways of apoptotic stimuli. We therefore examined the involvement of caspases in influenza virus-induced apoptosis using caspase inhibitors. We found that z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk effectively inhibited virus-induced apoptosis, whereas Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO showed partial and little effect on virus-induced cell death, respectively. Consistently, caspase-3-like activity, but not caspase-1-like activity, was increased in the virus-infected cells. The transfection of plasmids encoding viral inhibitors of caspase (v-FLIP or crmA) into HeLa cells inhibited apoptosis by virus infection. The peptide inhibitors of caspases used in this study did not inhibit viral replication. We conclude that influenza virus infection activates some caspases, and that this activation may be downstream of viral replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on host cell apoptotic proteases activated by influenza infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Membrane fusion by surrogate receptor-bound influenza haemagglutinin.
Abstract: In influenza infections, haemagglutinin (HA) mediates the fusion of virus and cellular membranes at endosomal pH, between pH 5 and 6. In vitro, when reconstituted into virosomes, efficient fusion requires target membranes to contain sialic acid receptors or receptor analogues. In the experiments reported, lipid-associated anti-HA monoclonal Fab' fragments were used as surrogate receptors to investigate the fusion capacity of receptor-bound HA compared with unbound HA. The conclusions are drawn, in contrast to those from previous studies, that bound HA can mediate fusion and that fusion mainly involves bound HA when the liposome targets are densely packed with surrogate receptors.
Relevant: False
Reason: Studies membrane fusion mediated by hemagglutinin with surrogate receptors, no direct link between viral genotype and phenotype.

Title: Influenza virus inhibits cleavage of the HSP70 pre-mRNAs at the polyadenylation site.
Abstract: Influenza virus infection is known to shut off the expression of host genes. To study the mechanism, we examined the effects of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus infection on the heat induction of a major heat shock protein, HSP70, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The induction of HSP70 protein synthesis was progressively suppressed with postinfection time when heat shock was applied. Northern hybridization analysis revealed the appearance of longer, heterogeneous HSP70 transcripts in the range of 2.7 to 30 kb with a concomitant decrease in the amount of the mature 2.7-kb mRNAs in the nucleus of the infected cells. Such longer beta-actin transcripts were also observed but with much less intensity. The longer HSP70 transcripts contained the downstream sequence of the polyadenylation site, as demonstrated by RNase protection with an antisense RNA probe containing the sequence through the polyadenylation sites. This clearly proved that influenza virus infection inhibits the polyadenylation-site cleavage of the pre-mRNAs by the host cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. One temperature-sensitive mutant virus carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation on the NS1 gene failed to inhibit the cleavage at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that the NS1 protein is involved in the inhibition of the pre-mRNA cleavage. This is the first report of the down-regulation of cellular mRNA maturation at the point of polyadenylation-site cleavage by virus infection and identifies a new mechanism by which the influenza virus shuts off host gene expression.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on how influenza virus inhibits host pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, a host gene expression mechanism, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Heterosubtypic immunity to lethal influenza A virus infection is associated with virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses induced in mucosa-associated tissues.
Abstract: Heterosubtypic immunity, defined as cross-reactive immune responses to influenza virus of a different serotype than the virus initially encountered, was investigated in association with virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses induced in systemic and mucosa-associated lymph nodes after immunization via different routes. Mice immunized by the pulmonary route with live nonpathogenic influenza virus, strain Udorn (H3N2), survived challenge with mouse-adapted pathogenic influenza virus, strain PR/8/34 (H1N1). These mice developed strong heterosubtypic CTL responses in spleen, cervical lymph nodes (CLN), and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN). Alternately, only 20% of mice immunized intravenously, intraperitoneally, or intranasally survived the challenge; all of these developed CTL responses in spleen and CLN, but not in MLN. Direct correlation between short-term and long-term memory heterosubtypic CTL responses induced in MLN and host recovery after lethal infection indicates that these CTL responses may play an important role in heterosubtypic immunity. Furthermore, induction and maintenance of memory CTL in regional mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues are highly dependent on mucosal immunization. The results implicate the mechanism of heterosubtypic immunity and should be an important consideration in the development of protective mucosal vaccines against variant strains of influenza and HIV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates immune responses (CTL) and heterosubtypic immunity without direct analysis of viral genotypes or mutations linked to phenotypes.

Title: Interactions of influenza virus with cultured cells: detailed kinetic modeling of binding and endocytosis.
Abstract: We performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the uptake of influenza virus (A/PR8/34) by Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in culture. Experimental procedures were based on the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of the fluorescent probe octadecylrhodamine B chloride (R18) incorporated in the viral envelope. Equilibrium for binding of influenza virus to MDCK cells (2.5 x 10(6)/mL) was reached quicker with temperature increases due to a faster dynamic mobility of the particles. We deduced that there are two kinds of binding sites for influenza virus in MDCK cells and determined the kinetic parameters of the binding process (adhesion and detachment rate constants), using a mass action kinetic model. As the temperature increases, the number of binding sites for influenza virus decreases, especially the high-affinity binding sites, whereas the value of the affinity constant for virus binding to the binding site, k, increases. Nevertheless, the binding association constant at equilibrium Ki, which is given by Ki = Niki, where Ni is the number of binding sites per cell, declines as the temperature increases. When endocytosis occurs, the total uptake of virions by the cells is larger than that observed in the process of binding at the same temperature, and the uptake proceeds for longer times. Using our mass kinetic model, we determined that at 20 degrees C, the rate constant of endocytosis, epsilon, for influenza virus with this cell line is 2.6 x 10(-)4 s-1, i.e., in the same range as in studies on endocytosis of liposomes.

Title: Mink lung epithelial cells: unique cell line that supports influenza A and B virus replication.
Abstract: We have demonstrated for the first time that a mink lung epithelial cell line (Mv1Lu) supports the replication of influenza A and B viruses, including the recently isolated H5N1 avian and human Hong Kong strains, to titers comparable to those in MDCK cells. These results suggest that Mv1Lu cells might serve as an alternative system for the isolation and cultivation of influenza A and B viruses and may be useful for vaccine development.

Title: Importance of a conserved TCR J alpha-encoded tyrosine for T cell recognition of an HLA B27/peptide complex.
Abstract: Human HLA B27-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the influenza A epitope NP383-391 use similar TCR alpha and beta chains, with two closely related J alpha segments used by six of nine CTL clones from three unrelated donors (Bowness et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1993. 23: 1417-1421). The role of TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR)3alpha residues 93 and 100-102 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis, following expression of the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains from one clone as a TCR zeta fusion heterodimer in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. For the first time we have measured direct binding of tetrameric HLA B*2705/NP383-391 complexes to transfected TCR. Independently peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC) were used to induce TCR-mediated degranulation of RBL transfectants. Our results show a key role for the conserved TCRalpha CDR3 J alpha-encoded residue Y102 in recognition of HLA B27/NP383-391. Thus the Y102D mutation abolished both tetramer binding and degranulation in the presence of peptide-pulsed APC. Even the Y102F mutation, differing only by a single hydroxyl group from the native TCR, abolished detectable degranulation. Further mutations F93A and S100R also abolished recognition. Interestingly, the N101A mutation recognized HLA B27/NP in functional assays despite having significantly reduced tetramer binding, a finding consistent with "kinetic editing" models of T cell activation. Modeling of the GRb TCR CDR3alpha loop suggests that residue Y102 contacts the HLA B*2705 alpha1 helix. It is thus possible that selection of germ-line TCRAJ-encoded residues at position 102 may be MHC driven.

Title: The RNA polymerase of influenza virus, bound to the 5' end of virion RNA, acts in cis to polyadenylate mRNA.
Abstract: We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. To further characterize the nucleotide residues at the 5' end of vRNA which might be involved in polyadenylation, a complete set of short and long model vRNA-like templates with mutations at nucleotides 1' to 13' (prime notation denotes numbering from the 5' end) of vRNA were synthesized and transcribed in vitro. The products were assayed for mRNA production with both reverse transcription-PCR and [alpha-32P]ATP incorporation assays. Results from these independent assays showed that vRNA templates with point mutations at positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' to 13' synthesized polyadenylated transcripts inefficiently compared with those with mutations at positions 1', 4' to 6', and 10'. Positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' are known to be involved in RNA polymerase binding. Furthermore, residues at positions 11' to 13' are known to be involved in base pairing between the 3' and 5' ends of vRNA. These findings demonstrate that the RNA polymerase has to bind to the 5' end of the template vRNA, which must then interact with the 3' end of the same template for polyadenylation to occur. These results support a model in which a cis-acting RNA polymerase is required for the polyadenylation of influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates RNA polymerase binding and polyadenylation of influenza virus mRNA, focusing on RNA elements rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Oral administration of a prodrug of the influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor GS 4071 protects mice and ferrets against influenza infection.
Abstract: We have recently described GS 4071, a carbocyclic transition-state analog inhibitor of the influenza virus neuraminidase, which has potent inhibitory activity comparable to that of 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en (GG167; zanamivir) when tested against influenza A virus replication and neuraminidase activity in vitro. We now report that GS 4071 is active against several strains of influenza A and B viruses in vitro and that oral GS 4104, an ethyl ester prodrug which is converted to GS 4071 in vivo, is active in the mouse and ferret models of influenza virus infection. Oral administration of 10 mg of GS 4104 per kg of body weight per day caused a 100-fold reduction in lung homogenate viral titers and enhanced survival in mice infected with influenza A or B viruses. In ferrets, a 25-mg/kg dose of GS 4104 given twice daily reduced peak viral titers in nasal washings and eliminated constitutional responses to influenza virus infection including fever, increased nasal signs (sneezing, nasal discharge, mouth breathing), and decreased activity. Consistent with our demonstration that the parent compound is highly specific for influenza virus neuraminidases, no significant drug-related toxicity was observed after the administration of oral dosages of GS 4104 of up to 800 mg/kg/day for 14 days in nonclinical toxicology studies with rats. These results indicate that GS 4104 is a novel, orally active antiviral agent with the potential to be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A and B virus infections.

Title: Enhancement of in vivo anti-influenza virus activity of 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone by drug delivery system using hydroxypropyl cellulose.
Abstract: Enhancement of in vivo antiviral activity of 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (F36) against H3N2 subtype of influenza A virus by drug delivery system (DDS) with hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) was studied. Although in the absence of HPC F36 (0.5 mg/kg) showed no antiviral activity against mouse-adapted influenza virus A/Guizhou/54/89 (H3N2) in mice, when F36 solution containing HPC was administered intranasally 5 min after the virus inoculation, proliferation of the virus in both nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities was inhibited significantly. The relationship between concentration (0.2-0.5%) and deposition ratio of HPC was studied. When 10 microliters of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated HPC solution was administered intranasally to BALB/c mice, deposition ratio of HPC at 6 h after inoculation in nasal cavity was dependent on its concentration. The deposition ratio of HPC in broncho-alveolar cavity, however, was reversely dependent on its concentration. Anti-influenza virus activity of F36 in nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities was dependent both on the concentration and deposition ratio of HPC. HPC was most effective at 0.5% in nasal cavity and at 0.3% in broncho-alveolar cavity. These results indicate that DDS with HPC enhances the anti-influenza virus activity of F36 in vivo.

Title: Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein, a transcription factor of the IFN regulatory factor family, regulates immune responses in vivo through control of interleukin 12 expression.
Abstract: Mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like syndrome and mount impaired responses to certain viral and bacterial infections. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the contributions of ICSBP to humoral and cellular immunity, we characterized the responses of control and ICSBP-/- mice to infection with influenza A (flu) and Leishmania major (L. major). Mice of both genotypes survived infections with flu, but differed markedly in the isotype distribution of antiflu antibodies. In sera of normal mice, immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a antibodies were dominant over IgG1 antibodies, a pattern indicative of a T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-driven response. In sera of ICSBP-/- mice, however, IgG1 antibodies dominated over IgG2a antibodies, a pattern indicative of a Th2-driven response. The dominance of IgG1 and IgE over IgG2a was detected in the sera of uninfected mice as well. A seeming Th2 bias of ICSBP-deficient mice was also uncovered in their inability to control infection with L. major, where resistance is known to be dependent on IL-12 and IFN-gamma as components of a Th1 response. Infected ICSBP-deficient mice developed fulminant, disseminated leishmaniasis as a result of failure to mount a Th1-mediated curative response, although T cells remained capable of secreting IFN-gamma and macrophages of producing nitric oxide. Compromised Th1 differentiation in ICSBP-/- mice could not be attributed to hyporesponsiveness of CD4(+) T cells to interleukin (IL)-12; however, the ability of uninfected and infected ICSBP-deficient mice to produce IL-12 was markedly impaired. This indicates that ICSBP is a deciding factor in Th responses governing humoral and cellular immunity through its role in regulating IL-12 expression.

Title: A pandemic warning?
Abstract: Introduction of new influenza type-A viruses, carrying different combinations of the viral envelope glycoproteins haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), have led to three major pandemics of influenza in humans this century. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these viruses have originated from avian influenza A viruses, either unchanged or after reassortment with humaninfluenza A viruses. In aquatic birds, all of the known H and N antigenic varieties (15 varieties carry H, nine carry N envelope glycoproteins) apparently circulate in a genetically conserved fashion. Viruses carrying the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 combinations were responsible for the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968, respectively. An influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype has now been identified in a human patient, raising discussions about its potential to spark a new human influenza pandemic.

Title: Binding of the influenza A virus to cell-surface receptors: structures of five hemagglutinin-sialyloligosaccharide complexes determined by X-ray crystallography.
Abstract: The structures of five complexes of the X-31 influenza A (H3N2) virus hemagglutinin with sialyloligosaccharide receptor analogs have been determined from 2.5 to 2.8 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. There is well-defined electron density for three to five saccharides in all five complexes and a striking conformational difference between two linear pentasaccharides with the same composition but different linkage [alpha(2-->6) or alpha(2-->3)] at the terminal sialic acid. The bound position of the terminal sialic acid (NeuAc) is the same in all five complexes and is identical to that reported previously from the study of mono- and trisaccharides. The two oligosaccharides with NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal linkages and GlcNAc at the third position have a folded conformation with the GlcNAc doubled back to contact the sialic acid. The pentasaccharide with a terminal NeuAc alpha(2-->3)Gal linkage and GlcNAc at the third position has an extended (not folded) conformation and exits from the opposite side of the binding site than the alpha(2-->6)-linked molecule of the same composition. The difference between the conformation of the pentasaccharide with a 2,6 linkage and the trisaccharide 2,6-sialyllactose suggests that 2,6-sialyllactose is not, as previously believed, an appropriate analog of natural influenza A virus receptors. The oligosaccharides studied are NeuAc alpha(2-->3)Gal beta(1-->4)Glc, NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal beta(1-->4)Glc, NeuAc alpha(2-->3)Gal beta(1-->3)GlcNAc beta(1-->3)Gal beta(1-->4)Glc, NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal beta(1-->4)GlcNAc beta(1-->3)Gal beta(1-->4)Glc, and [NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal beta(1-->4)GlcNAc]2 beta(1-->3/6)Gal-beta-O-(CH2)5-COOCH3.

Title: Dominant-negative mutants of human MxA protein: domains in the carboxy-terminal moiety are important for oligomerization and antiviral activity.
Abstract: Human MxA protein is an interferon-induced 76-kDa GTPase that exhibits antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. Wild-type MxA accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells. TMxA, a modified form of wild-type MxA carrying a foreign nuclear localization signal, accumulates in the cell nucleus. Here we show that MxA protein is translocated into the nucleus together with TMxA when both proteins are expressed simultaneously in the same cell, demonstrating that MxA molecules form tight complexes in living cells. To define domains important for MxA-MxA interaction and antiviral function in vivo, we expressed mutant forms of MxA together with wild-type MxA or TMxA in appropriate cells and analyzed subcellular localization and interfering effects. An MxA deletion mutant, MxA(359-572), formed heterooligomers with TMxA and was translocated to the nucleus, indicating that the region between amino acid positions 359 and 572 contains an interaction domain which is critical for oligomerization of MxA proteins. Mutant T103A with threonine at position 103 replaced by alanine had lost both GTPase and antiviral activities. T103A exhibited a dominant-interfering effect on the antiviral activity of wild-type MxA rendering MxA-expressing cells susceptible to infection with influenza A virus, Thogoto virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. To determine which sequences are critical for the dominant-negative effect of T103A, we expressed truncated forms of T103A together with wild-type protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the last 90 amino acids had lost interfering capacity, indicating that an intact C terminus was required. Surprisingly, a truncated version of MxA representing only the C-terminal half of the molecule exerted also a dominant-negative effect on wild-type function, demonstrating that sequences in the C-terminal moiety of MxA are necessary and sufficient for interference. However, all MxA mutants formed hetero-oligomers with TMxA and were translocated to the nucleus, indicating that physical interaction alone is not sufficient for disturbing wild-type function. We propose that dominant-negative mutants directly influence wild-type activity within hetero-oligomers or else compete with wild-type MxA for a cellular or viral target.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on MxA protein mutants and their effects on antiviral activity, not on viral genotypes or phenotypes.

When mice that had been exposed to 10 50% lethal doses of the virus were treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg of GR per kg of body weight 1 day before infection and 1 and 4 days postinfection, all of the mice survived over the 21-day experimental period. At the end of this period, the mean survival time (in days) for control mice treated with saline was 10.5 days, and there were no survivors. The grade of pulmonary consolidations and the virus titers in the lung tissues of infected mice treated with GR were significantly lower than those in the lung tissues of infected mice treated with saline. GR did not show any effects on the viability or replication of influenza virus A2 in vitro. When splenic T cells from GR-treated mice were adoptively transferred to mice exposed to influenza virus, 100% of the recipients survived, compared to 0% survival for recipient mice inoculated with naive T cells or splenic B cells and macrophages from GR-treated mice. In addition, the antiviral activities of GR on influenza virus infection in mice were not demonstrated when it was administered to infected mice in combination with anti-gamma interferon (anti-IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that GR may protect mice exposed to a lethal amount of influenza virus through the stimulation of IFN-gamma production by T cells, because T cells have been shown to be producer cells of IFN-gamma stimulated with the compound.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the antiviral effect of glycyrrhizin on influenza infection in mice without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Human mucus protease inhibitor in airway fluids is a potential defensive compound against infection with influenza A and Sendai viruses.
Abstract: Tryptase Clara, a trypsin-like protease localized exclusively in and secreted from Clara cells to the bronchial epithelium of rat, proteolytically activates the infectivity of influenza A virus [H. Kido, Y. Yokogoshi, K. Sakai, M. Tashiro, Y. Kishino, A. Fukutomi, and N. Katunuma (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13573-13579]. We report here that human mucus protease inhibitor (MPI), a major inhibitor of granulocyte elastase in the lining fluids of the human respiratory tract, significantly inhibited proteolytic activation of the infectivity of influenza A and Sendai viruses by tryptase Clara in vitro and multi-cycles of mouse-adapted influenza A virus replication in rat lungs in vitro. Recombinant MPI and the C- but not the N-terminal domain of the MPI inhibited both the proteolytic activity of tryptase Clara and the activation of virus infection. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of recombinant MPI and the C-terminal domain for tryptase Clara with Sendai virus envelope glycoprotein as substrate were 7.4 and 61.6 nM, respectively. These results indicate that MPI is a defensive compound against virus infection. Since there is evidence suggesting that concentrations of MPI in respiratory fluids are insufficient for prevention of virus infection, administration of MPI in the airway may be useful for treatment of these virus infections.

Title: Binding of influenza A virus to monosialoganglioside (GM3) reconstituted in glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin membranes.
Abstract: The binding of influenza A virus to GM3-containing monolayers at an air/water interface was quantitatively investigated by use of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). A QCM was horizontally attached to the monolayer from the air phase and the binding behavior of influenza virus was followed by the frequency changes of the QCM. GM3 was reconstituted in the momolayer of sphingomyelin (SM) or glucosylceramide (GlcCer). When the mole fraction of GM3 was below 30 mol%, the binding rate of the influenza A virus to the GM3/GlcCer membrane was significantly faster than that to GM3/SM membranes. When the mole fraction of GM3 in SM was below 20 mol%, specific binding of influenza virus was not observed at all. Binding of the virus to the GM3/GlcCer mixed membrane was inhibited by the addition of sialyllactose (Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc). The virus binding was also visually observed by scanning electron microscopy. Viruses selectively bound to GM3/GlcCer (20:80, by mol%) membrane, but not to GM3/SM (20:80, by mol%) membrane. Furthermore, it was suggested that specific binding of influenza virus to the GM3/GlcCer membrane induced the changes in morphology of virus. It was clearly demonstrated that binding of influenza virus to GM3 was influenced by matrix lipids surrounding GM3.

Title: Possible involvement of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase in cell death by influenza virus infection.
Abstract: We reported previously that influenza virus infection induces the apoptotic death of HeLa cells associated with activation of the Fas gene. In this report, we show that transfection with a PKR having a point mutation in the catalytic domain of K at 296 to R suppressed both the augmented expression of Fas and cell death by influenza virus infection. These results suggested the involvement of PKR in influenza virus-induced cell death.

Title: Emergence of avian H1N1 influenza viruses in pigs in China.
Abstract: Avian influenza A viruses from Asia are recognized as the source of genes that reassorted with human viral genes to generate the Asian/57 (H2N2) and Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) pandemic strains earlier in this century. Here we report the genetic analysis of avian influenza A H1N1 viruses recently isolated from pigs in southern China, a host suspected to generate new pandemic strains through gene reassortment events. Each of the eight gene segments was of avian origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these genes form an Asian sublineage of the Eurasian avian lineage, suggesting that these viruses are an independent introduction into pigs in Asia. The presence of avian influenza viruses in pigs in China places them in an optimal position for transmission to humans and may serve as an early warning of the emergence of the next human influenza virus pandemic.

Title: Ribosomal scanning past the primary initiation codon as a mechanism for expression of CTL epitopes encoded in alternative reading frames.
Abstract: An increasing amount of evidence has shown that epitopes restricted to MHC class I molecules and recognized by CTL need not be encoded in a primary open reading frame (ORF). Such epitopes have been demonstrated after stop codons, in alternative reading frames (RF) and within introns. We have used a series of frameshifts (FS) introduced into the Influenza A/PR/8 /34 nucleoprotein (NP) gene to confirm the previous in vitro observations of cryptic epitope expression, and show that they are sufficiently expressed to prime immune responses in vivo. This presentation is not due to sub-dominant epitopes, transcription from cryptic promoters beyond the point of the FS, or internal initiation of translation. By introducing additional mutations to the construct exhibiting the most potent presentation, we have identified initiation codon readthrough (termed scanthrough here, where the scanning ribosome bypasses the conventional initiation codon, initiating translation further downstream) as the likely mechanism of epitope production. Further mutational analysis demonstrated that, while it should operate during the expression of wild-type (WT) protein, scanthrough does not provide a major source of processing substrate in our system. These findings suggest (i) that the full array of self- and pathogen-derived epitopes available during thymic selection and infection has not been fully appreciated and (ii) that cryptic epitope expression should be considered when the specificity of a CTL response cannot be identified or in therapeutic situations when conventional CTL targets are limited, as may be the case with latent viral infections and transformed cells. Finally, initiation codon readthrough provides a plausible explanation for the presentation of exocytic proteins by MHC class I molecules.

Title: Promoter elements in the influenza vRNA terminal structure.
Abstract: The role of the partially double-stranded influenza vRNA terminal structure and its constitutive elements as a promoter signal was studied in vivo in a series of nucleotide substitution and insertion derivatives. A series of single and complementary double exchanges restoring intrastrand base pairing shows that a distal promoter element consists of a six-base pair double-stranded RNA rod in long-range complementary interaction. Within the distal element, all base pair positions are freely exchangeable, and hence no nucleotide-specific recognition could be identified. The proximal promoter element consists of nine partially complementary nucleotides at the vRNA 5' and 3' end. The nine plus six base pair panhandle rod of protein-free vRNA is interrupted by a central third element, a single unpaired nucleotide: adenosine 10 or various substitute residues, which appears to cause a bulged conformation in the overall structure. Mutagenization studies in the promoter proximal element indicate that, upon binding to polymerase, nucleotides at positions 2 and 3 interact with positions 9 and 8 within each branch (5' or 3') in short-range base pairing. In this conformation, the intermediate positions 4-7 are exposed as a single-stranded tetra-loop, which includes invariant guanosine residue 5 in the top conformational position of the 5' segment loop. Altogether, the three base paired segments in angular conjunction to each other adopt a conformation that is described in a "corkscrew model" for an activated stage of vRNA/polymerase interaction.

Reason: The paper studies RNA promoter elements and their structure-function relationships without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Influenza virus polymerase basic protein 1 interacts with influenza virus polymerase basic protein 2 at multiple sites.
Abstract: Three polymerase proteins of influenza type A virus interact with each other to form the active polymerase complex. Polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) can interact with PB2 in the presence or absence of polymerase acidic protein. In this study, we investigated the domains of PB1 involved in complex formation with PB2 in vivo, using coexpression and coimmunoprecipitation of the PB1-PB2 complex with monospecific antibodies. Results show that PB1 possesses at least two regions which can interact independently and form stable complexes with PB2. Both of these regions are located at the NH2 terminus of PB1; the COOH-terminal half of PB1 is not involved in interacting with PB2. Deletion analysis further demonstrated that the interacting regions of PB1 encompass amino acids (aa) 48 to 145 and aa 251 to 321. Linker insertions throughout the PB1 sequences did not affect complex formation with PB2. Deletion and linker-insertion mutants of PB1 were tested for polymerase activity in vivo. For this analysis, we developed a simplified assay for viral polymerase activity that uses a reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene containing the 5' and 3' ends of influenza viral promoter and nontranslating regions (minus sense) of the NS gene joined to a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme at its 3' end. This assay demonstrated that all deletion mutants of PB1 exhibited either background or greatly reduced polymerase activity irrespective of the ability to interact with PB2 and that all linker-insertion mutants except one at the extreme COOH end (L-746) of PB1 were also negative for viral polymerase activity. These results show that compared with complex formation of PB1 with PB2, the polymerase activity of PB1 was extremely sensitive to structural perturbation.

Title: Sulphatide binds to human and animal influenza A viruses, and inhibits the viral infection.
Abstract: We found, by using a virus overlay assay, that influenza A virus isolates bind to sulphatide (HSO3-Gal beta 1-->1'Cer), which has no sialic acid residue, and that the infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with the human influenza virus A/Memphis/1/71 (H3N2) is inhibited by sulphatide. A/Memphis/1/71 (H3N2) causes obvious haemagglutination and low-pH haemolysis of asialoerythrocytes reconstituted with sulphatide. All influenza A virus isolates from the species of animals so far tested bound to sulphatide. The sulphatide-binding specificity of the isolates was different from the viral sialyl-linkage specificity. Influenza A virus isolates also bound to galactosyl ceramide (GalCer; Gal beta 1-->1'Cer), as well as sulphatide, in the virus overlay assays. In contrast, the influenza virus did not bind to N-deacyl, a derivative of sulphatide, glucosyl ceramide or the other neutral glycolipids tested. These results indicate that the linkage of galactose, or sulphated galactose, to ceramide is important for viral binding.

Title: Oral immunization with a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus protects mice against influenza.
Abstract: Mice immunized with two intragastrically administered doses of a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus containing the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes from H1N1 influenza virus developed serum anti-H1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody that completely protected the lungs from challenge with H1N1. Almost all of the mice given two intragastric doses also developed mucosal anti-H1 IgA antibody, and those with high anti-H1 IgA titers had completely protected noses. Intramuscular injection of the vaccine protected the lungs but not the noses from challenge. We also found that the vaccine enhanced recovery from infection caused by a shifted (H3N2) influenza virus, probably through the induction of nucleoprotein-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. A replication-deficient, orally administered, enteric-coated, vaccinia virus-vectored vaccine might safely protect humans against influenza.

Title: The roles of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) and TNF in antigen-induced programmed cell death in T cell receptor transgenic mice.
Abstract: The possible involvement of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) and TNF in antigen-specific AICD of thymocytes and mature T cells has been investigated. Antigenic stimulation in vivo of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific TCRtg mice was used to demonstrate that the kinetics of thymocyte and peripheral CD4+ T cell deletion are similar in mice with normal (+/+) or defective Fas (lpr/lpr) background, indicating that a Fas-independent pathway(s) is responsible for the deletion of activated T cells. TCRtg-+/+ or TCRtg-lpr/lpr mice injected with murine TNF-blocking MAb (TN3) showed rapid apoptosis of thymocytes after HA stimulation, indicating that death signaling through Fas and TNF receptors is not essential for HA-induced thymocyte deletion. CDC peripheral T cells in TCRtg-lpr/lpr mice did not undergo apoptosis following injection with HA and TN3, indicating that TNF-mediated apoptosis is involved in the deletion of mature T cells after antigenic stimulation. However, apoptosis still occurred in TCRtg-+/+ mice injected with TN3, indicating that both Fas- and TNF-mediated cell death can contribute to the deletion of activated peripheral T cells.

Title: A novel antiviral agent which inhibits the endonuclease of influenza viruses.
Abstract: A novel anti-influenza virus compound, flutimide, was identified in extracts of a recently identified fungal species, Delitschia confertaspora (F. Pelaez, J.D. Polishook, M. Valldosera, and J.Guarro, Mycotaxon 50:115-122, 1994). The compound, a substituted 2,6-diketopiperazine, selectively inhibited the cap-dependent transcriptase of influenza A and B viruses and had no effect on the activities of other polymerases. Similar to the 4-substituted 2,4-dioxobutanoic acids, a series of transcriptase inhibitors which we described previously (J. Tomassini, H. Selnick, M.E. Davies, M.E. Armstrong, J. Baldwin, M. Bourgeois, J.Hastings, D. Hazuda, J. Lewis, W. McClements, G. Ponticello, E. Radzilowski, G. Smith, A. Tebben, and A. Wolfe, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 38:2827-2837, 1994), this inhibitor, which is a natural product, affected neither the initiation nor the elongation of influenza virus mRNA synthesis, but it specifically targeted the cap-dependent endonuclease of the transcriptase. Additionally, the compound was inhibitory to the replication of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture. The selective antiviral properties of this compound further demonstrate the utility of influenza virus endonuclease as a target of antiviral agents.

Title: Mutational analysis of influenza B virus RNA transcription in vitro.
Abstract: The roles of the 3'- and 5'-terminal nucleotides and the panhandle structure of influenza B virus virion RNA were analyzed in vitro by transcription of model RNA templates with influenza B virus RNA polymerase. The results suggest that the stability of the panhandle and breathing of the extreme ends of the panhandle are important factors for efficient transcription. Influenza B virus polymerase appears to be more tolerant of mutations in the panhandle structure than influenza A virus polymerase. This is consistent with the greater degree of heterogeneity observed naturally in the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the virion RNA of influenza B virus than in influenza A virus.

Title: An amino-terminal polypeptide fragment of the influenza virus NS1 protein possesses specific RNA-binding activity and largely helical backbone structure.
Abstract: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus has the unique property of binding to three apparently different RNAs: poly A; a stem-bulge in U6 small nuclear RNA; and double-stranded RNA. One of our major goals is to determine how the NS1 protein recognizes and binds to its several RNA targets. As the first step for conducting structural studies, we have succeeded in identifying a fragment of the NS1 protein that possesses all the RNA-binding activities of the full-length protein. The RNA-binding fragment consists of the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein. We have developed procedures for obtaining large amounts of the polypeptide in pure form. This has enabled us to establish the RNA-binding properties of this polypeptide and to demonstrate that it retains the ability to dimerize exhibited by the full-length protein. In addition, far-UV CD spectroscopy indicates that this RNA-binding polypeptide is largely (approximately 80%) helical, suggesting that the mode of dimerization of the NS1 protein and of its interaction with RNA is mediated, at least in part, by helices.
Relevant: False

Title: Nonpolarized distribution of glycosylphosphatidylinositols in the plasma membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.
Abstract: Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and serve to anchor a variety of proteins to the exoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes. GPIs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in excess of the amount needed for protein modification. The fate of the excess GPIs is unknown, but they may be retained in the ER, transported to other membranes, and/or metabolized. In relation to this problem, we were interested in determining whether GPIs were transported to the plasma membrane and whether, like GPI-anchored proteins, their presence was confined to the apical plasma membrane domain in polarized epithelial cells. Polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cell monolayers were incubated with [3H]mannose or [3H]ethanolamine to label GPIs and then infected with enveloped viruses. We used influenza virus (flu) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for these experiments as these viruses are assembled at the cell surface and acquire their envelope lipids from the plasma membrane. Furthermore, flu and VSV bud specifically from the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, respectively. Flu and VSV were isolated from the apical and basolateral media, respectively, and subjected to lipid analysis. Radiolabeled GPIs were found in both viruses. Moreover, the membrane concentration of GPIs (i.e. GPI radioactivity normalized to membrane mass) in the two viruses was essentially the same. These observations suggest that (i) non-protein-linked GPIs are located at the plasma membrane; (ii) since GPIs are synthesized in the ER, they must be transported from the ER to the plasma membrane; and (iii) transport of nonprotein-linked GPIs is not influenced by the sorting processes that target GPI-anchored proteins exclusively to the apical plasma membrane.

Title: Suppression of influenza virus infection by an N-thioacetylneuraminic acid acrylamide copolymer resistant to neuraminidase.
Abstract: We have previously shown that alpha-2-O-methyl-5-N-thioacetylneuraminic acid (alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me) has a higher affinity to bromelain-treated hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus than sialic acid from natural sources (Machytka et al., 1993, FEBS Lett. 334, 117-120). We have now compared the inhibitory effects of alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me and other sialic acid analogs on receptor binding and plaque formation of intact influenza A viruses. When alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me was polymerized by conjugation to polyacrylamide, its affinity to HA increased 10(3)-fold. When analyzed by plaque reduction, the alpha-Neu5thioAc2 polymer was about 10 times more efficient as an inhibitor of virus replication than the alpha-Neu5Ac2 polymer, stressing the importance of sulfur at C5. The S-glycoside alpha-2-S-methyl-5-N-thioacetylneuraminic acid (alpha-Neu5thioAc2SMe) had the same affinity to HA as alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me, but was resistant to neuraminidase. The alpha-Neu5thioAc2S polymer interfered with the replication of a wider spectrum of influenza A virus subtypes than the alpha-Neu5thioAc2 polymer. The results indicate that the alpha-Neu5thioAc2S polymer has the potential to be used as an inhibitor of influenza virus infection.

Title: Inhibition of replication of avian influenza viruses by the neuraminidase inhibitor 4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid.
Abstract: The sialidase inhibitor 4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en), designed with computer assistance and knowledge of the crystal structure of influenza virus neuraminidase, has shown antiviral effects in animal models of human influenza (M. von Itzstein et al., Nature, 363, 418-423, 1993). Here we demonstrate that the compound efficiently inhibits the enzyme activity of all nine subtypes of avian influenza A neuraminidase in vitro. When administered intranasally to chickens infected with lethal viruses, high doses of the compound (1000 micrograms/kg) protected 85% of birds harboring A/Chick/Victoria/1/85 (H7N7), a fowl plague virus, but not chickens infected with other highly virulent viruses of the N1, N2, or N3 subtype. This differential inhibitory effect was also seen in a plaque reduction assay with Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), where 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en was more effective against A/Chick/Vic/85 (H7N7) than A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1). In contrast to the substantial plaque reduction observed in MDCK cells, the drug failed to inhibit plaque formation in chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with either A/Chick/Vic/85 or A/FPV/Rostock/34, regardless of its concentration. The different levels of drug efficacy seen in two cell systems most likely reflect the location of virus budding and release in polarized versus nonpolarized cells, as well as the compound's mode of extracellular action.

Title: Inhibitory effect of pyridobenzazoles on virus replication in vitro.
Abstract: Twelve species of pyridobenzazoles and pyrimidobenzimidazole were examined as inhibitors of the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HeLa cells. From the pyridobenzazoles studied, 2-benzamido-4-cyano-1-oxo-1H,5H-pyrido[1,2-alpha]benzimidazol emerged as a potent inhibitor of the RSV. Based on its inhibitory effect on the cytopathogenicity of the RSV in HeLa cells, the 50% effective dose was found to be 0.95 micrograms/ml. The cytotoxicity of this compound for HeLa cells was examined by monitoring the incorporation of radiolabeled uridine into cellular RNA. The selectivity index was ca. 30, the same as Virazole.

Title: Prevalence and activation phenotype of Sendai virus-specific CD4+ T cells.
Abstract: The relative prevalence of Sendai virus-specific CD4+ T helper precursors (Thp) has been assessed by limiting dilution analysis (LDA). Within 10 days after intranasal inoculation of C57BL/6 mice, Thp prevalence increased from < 1 in 10(5) to approximately 1 in 200 in CD4+ T-cell-enriched spleen and mediastinal lymph node populations. These frequencies remained elevated relative to naive animals, with the majority of the Thp recovered at 2-3 months after infection being found in the spleen. The "memory" Thp express an "activated" L-selectin-low, CD44-high, alpha 4-integrin-high phenotype, comparable to that described previously for CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) specific for Sendai virus. Background effects for the IL-2-based Thp analysis are, however, less predictable than those found previously for the 51Cr release CTLp LDA, as the extent of non-virus-specific lymphokine production varies. However, provided the analysis is appropriately controlled, the approach does allow useful comparisons between phenotypically different subsets of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

Title: Generation of cytotoxic and humoral immune responses by nonreplicative recombinant Semliki Forest virus.
Abstract: The Semliki Forest virus (SFV) expression system can be used to package recombinant RNA into infectious suicide particles. Such RNA encodes only the SFV replicase and the heterologous protein but no structural proteins of SFV, and it is thus deficient in productive replication. We demonstrate here that infection of C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice with recombinant SFV expressing the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus (SFV-NP) resulted in efficient priming of influenza virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses. The generated CTLs lysed both homologous (A/PR/8/34) and heterologous (A/HK/68) influenza virus-infected, or peptide-coated, target cells to a similar degree as CTLs induced by wild-type influenza virus in a major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted fashion. As few as 100 infectious units of virus induced a strong CTL response. Induction of CTL by SFV-NP could also be achieved in CD4 gene-targeted mice, demonstrating the independence of the primary CTL response of CD4+ helper T cells. One immunization generated a CTL response that peaked after 1 week, and an additional booster injection generated a CTL memory, which was still detectable after 40 days. SFV-NP immunizations also generated high-titered IgG humoral responses that remained significant after several months. These results demonstrate that the recombinant SFV suicide system is highly efficient in antigen presentation and suggest that it may have a potential as a recombinant vaccine.

Title: Identification of annexin 33 kDa in cultured cells as a binding protein of influenza viruses.
Abstract: The binding of three influenza A and one influenza B virus strains to proteins of three continuously cultured cell lines was studied using protein overlay and immunostaining methods. The results obtained indicated the presence of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent binding of the virus strains; virus binding to proteins in the molecular mass range from about 40 to 103 kDa was dependent on sialic acid, whereas binding to the 33 kDa protein was independent of sialic acid. The 33 kDa binding protein was identified as annexin, a widely distributed non-glycosylated calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a cellular protein binding influenza viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Porcine respiratory coronavirus-mediated interference against influenza virus replication in the respiratory tract of feeder pigs.
Abstract: Effect of prior porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection on replication of H1N1-influenza virus in the respiratory tract of swine was studied. In an initial experiment, 3 groups of 5 feeder pigs were studied. Pigs of 2 groups were inoculated sequentially with PRCV, followed by H1N1-influenza virus at 2- and 3-day intervals. Pigs of the other group were inoculated with H1N1-influenza virus only. Pigs were monitored clinically and examined for nasal excretion of influenza virus. In the singly influenza virus-inoculated group, 83% of nasal swab specimens were influenza virus-positive over a period of 6 days after inoculation. In the dually virus-inoculated groups, only 27% (2-day interval) and 53% (3-day interval) of nasal swab specimens were virus-positive over the same postinoculation period. However, clinical signs of infection in these dually inoculated pigs were more severe than those in the singly influenza virus-inoculated pigs. There were no significant differences in antibody responses against influenza virus among the 3 groups of pigs. In a second experiment, 2 groups of pigs were studied. One group of pigs was inoculated sequentially with PRCV, followed by H1N1-influenza virus 2 days later; the other group was inoculated with H1N1-influenza virus only. Pigs of both groups were serially euthanatized on postinoculation days (PID) 1, 2, 3, and 4 (after influenza virus). At necropsy, influenza virus titer and immunofluorescence in lung tissue were determined and gross lung lesions were recorded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Neutralization enzyme immunoassay for influenza virus.
Abstract: A neutralization enzyme immunoassay (N-EIA) was developed for the detection of antibody titer rises in sera of patients infected with influenza A (H3N2) virus. In this N-EIA, a selected strain of influenza A (H3N2) virus was added to monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells in microtiter plates. After 24 h, the replicated virus could be demonstrated with a virus-specific enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody. Preincubation of the influenza virus with convalescent-phase sera of patients infected with influenza A (H3N2) virus resulted 1 day later in decreased absorbance values that could be used for calculation of neutralization titers. From use of paired serum samples from 10 patients with a history of flu-like symptoms, the results obtained with N-EIA correlated well (r = 0.83) with those of the standard hemagglutination inhibition test.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a neutralization assay for detecting antibodies but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Effect of simultaneous administration of cold-adapted and wild-type influenza A viruses on experimental wild-type influenza infection in humans.
Abstract: On the basis of the ability of the attenuated cold-adapted strain of influenza A virus to suppress disease production in ferrets simultaneously infected with epidemic influenza virus (P. Whitaker-Dowling, H.F. Maassab, and J.S. Youngner, J. Infect. Dis. 164:1200-1202, 1991), an evaluation of the ability of the cold-adapted virus to modify clinical disease in humans was made. Adult volunteers with prechallenge serum hemagglutination-inhibition titers to the influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus of < or = 1:8 received either 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses of the wild-type A/Kawasaki virus or a mixture of 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses of each of the wild-type virus and a cold-adapted A/Kawasaki reassortant virus by intranasal drops in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Symptoms and wild-type virus shedding were assessed daily for 6 days following challenge. Results were compared with those derived from another group of volunteers who received only cold-adapted virus. Volunteers who received the mixed inoculum of cold-adapted and wild-type viruses had lower symptom scores than those who received wild-type virus alone, suggesting that coinfection with the cold-adapted virus may modify wild-type virus infection, but the differences were not statistically significant in this small study. The data demonstrate that administration of cold-adapted influenza A virus to humans at the time of wild-type virus infection is a safe procedure.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates the effect of simultaneous administration of cold-adapted and wild-type viruses on infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: In vitro and in vivo inhibition of ortho- and paramyxovirus infections by a new class of sulfonic acid polymers interacting with virus-cell binding and/or fusion.
Abstract: A series of sulfonic acid polymers were shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus. The compounds inhibit the replication of RSV and influenza A virus in HeLa and MDCK cells, at concentrations of 0.16 and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and are nontoxic to growing cells at concentrations of > 100 micrograms/ml. The mode of antiviral action of the sulfonic acid polymers can be ascribed to inhibition of virus-cell fusion (for influenza A virus) or inhibition of both virus-cell binding and fusion (for RSV). The sulfonic acid prototype PAMPS [poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid)], when administered intranasally to mice as a single dose of 10 or 50 mg per kg of body weight at the time of infection, completely inhibited influenza A virus replication (in lungs) and virus-associated lung consolidation in immunocompetent mice and completely protected NMRI and SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice against influenza A virus-associated mortality. When administered 1 h before or after virus inoculation, no protective effect was observed at a dose of 10 or 100 mg/kg. Sulfonic acid polymers exert selective inhibitory effects on RSV and influenza A virus replication.

Title: Characterization of the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA.
Abstract: It has been shown that a stretch of uridines (U's) near the 5' end of the virion RNA of influenza A virus is the polyadenylation site for viral mRNA synthesis. In addition, the RNA duplex made up the 3' and 5' terminal sequences adjacent to the U stretch is also involved in polyadenylation. We have further characterized the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA with a ribonucleoprotein transfection system. We found that the optimal length of the U stretch is 5 to 7 uridine residues. We also showed that the upstream sequence at the 5' end is not involved in polyadenylation and that the optimal distance between the 5' end and the U stretch is 16 nucleotides. The combination of these features defines the polyadenylation site and differentiates this signal from other U stretches scattered throughout the genomes of influenza viruses.

Title: Protection against the mouse-adapted A/FM/1/47 strain of influenza A virus in mice by a monoclonal antibody with cross-neutralizing activity among H1 and H2 strains.
Abstract: The monoclonal antibody designated C179 was found to neutralize all of the H1 and H2 strains of influenza A virus studied (Y. Okuno, Y. Isegawa, F. Sasao, and S. Ueda, J. Virol. 67:2552-2558, 1993). In the present study, the ability of C179 to protect mice from the lethal effect of the A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) strain was examined. When the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 micrograms of C179 per mouse a day before the virus challenge (2.0 x 10(3) focus-forming units per mouse), all of the mice survived. Moreover, significantly higher survival rates were observed in mice receiving 1,000 micrograms of C179 per mouse 2 days after the virus challenge than in those receiving phosphate-buffered saline alone. These results indicate that C179 is effective not only for prevention but also for treatment of mice infected with H1 and H2 strains. The possibility that C179 can be used for passive immunization in humans is discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates protective efficacy of a monoclonal antibody but does not analyze viral genotypes or their phenotypic effects.

Title: IgG3 reactive rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis: etiologic and pathogenic considerations.
Abstract: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a polyclonal autoantibody directed against the Fc portion of IgG. Although the role of RF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear, immune complexes that form between RF and IgG can activate the classical complement (C) pathway, leading to pathogenic outcomes involving inflammatory events and tissue damage. The specificity of serum RF and RF produced by rheumatoid synovial cells (RSC) is different. Serum RF has specificity for rabbit IgG and human IgG subclasses IgG1, 2, and 4, but binds poorly to IgG3. The affinity of serum RF for IgG Fc is low, having an association constant of 10(4)-10(5) M-1. RSC RF, however, has specificity for human IgG and high avidity for IgG3. Because of this greater specificity and avidity for IgG3, and because RSC RF may be pathogenically more important than serum RF, an important role for IgG3-reactive RF in RA may exist. Binding of RF to IgG may be dependent on the allotype and glycosylation of IgG. Infectious agents present in RA patients may directly or indirectly induce the production of certain RF. In this communication, we review and expand on several observations examining the role of IgG3-reactive RF in RA including: 1) binding differences between RF derived from RSC and serum; 2) glycosylation characteristics of IgG and its interaction with RF; 3) apparent allotype dependent binding of IgG3-reactive RF; and 4) possible relationship between infectious agents and the production of IgG3-reactive RF. Taken together, these observations suggest an important role for IgG3-reactive RF in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of RA.

Title: Determination of the agretopic residues of a peptide co-restricted to different class II isotypes, I-Au and I-Eu, and its application for preparation of a synthetic peptide vaccine against influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68.
Abstract: We have defined that residues 46 and 54 on a synthetic peptide composed of residues 43-58 of pigeon cytochrome c (p43-58) work as agretopes (sites bound to an MHC molecule) in I-Ab mice. Substitution of amino acid residues on these positions altered the peptide to bind with the other MHC molecules. Furthermore, by substituting the agretopic residues with a variety of amino acids, we could determine the class II binding motif for each MHC molecule. In the present study, immunogenicity of a peptide, 46R50V54A, carrying valine (V) at epitopic (site bound to TCR) position 50, arginine (R) and alanine (A) at agretopic positions 46 and 54 of the p43-58, respectively has been analyzed in B10.PL (H-2u) mice. We found that this peptide bound to two different class II isotypes, I-Au and I-Eu. Arginine at position 46 or alanine at position 54 of the 46R50V54A was shown to be critical for binding to I-Au or I-Eu, respectively. Further, on the basis of this class II binding motif we could prepare potent peptide vaccines against influenza A/Aichi/2/68 virus in B10.PL mice.

Title: Response to influenza infection in mice with a targeted disruption in the interferon gamma gene.
Abstract: Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells and has been noted to be a first line of host defense in the control of viral infections. To examine further the role of this cytokine in the control of viral infections, mice with a targeted mutation in the IFN-gamma gene were infected with influenza virus, and the in vivo antibody and cell-mediated immune response to viral infection were examined. In addition, cell lines and clones were derived from the immunized animals and the in vitro cytokine production and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response were analyzed. The absence of IFN-gamma led to increased production of influenza-specific IgG1, IL-4, and IL-5 as compared to wild-type littermate control animals. In contrast, there was no difference noted in the development of an effective CTL response between IFN-gamma-deficient and wild-type animals. In this model of experimental influenza infection, IFN-gamma is not necessary for the development of an effective humoral or cellular immune response to challenge with this respiratory virus.

Title: 4-Guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid is a highly effective inhibitor both of the sialidase (neuraminidase) and of growth of a wide range of influenza A and B viruses in vitro.
Abstract: The sialidase (neuraminidase) inhibitor 4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en) has been examined for the ability to inhibit the growth of a wide range of influenza A and B viruses in vitro in comparison with amantadine, rimantadine, and ribavirin. 4-Guanidino-Neu5Ac2en inhibited plaque formation by laboratory-passaged strains of influenza A and B viruses, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.014 microM. A wider range of values (0.02 to 16 microM) was obtained with more recent clinical isolates, but in all cases 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en inhibited influenza A and B virus replication at lower concentrations than amantadine, rimantadine, or ribavirin. Inhibition by 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en was not obviously affected by the passage history of the viruses or by resistance to amantadine or rimantadine. 4-Guanidino-Neu5Ac2en was a very potent inhibitor of the sialidases of all the influenza viruses examined, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.00064 to 0.0079 microM. No cytotoxicity was observed with 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en at up to 10 mM. 4-Guanidino-Neu5Ac2en therefore represents a new potent and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B virus sialidase activity and replication in vitro.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the inhibitory effect of a compound on viral neuraminidase and growth, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Pulmonary surfactant is a potential endogenous inhibitor of proteolytic activation of Sendai virus and influenza A virus.
Abstract: The pathogenicities of influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses have been proposed to be primarily determined by a host cell protease(s) that activates viral infectivity by proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoproteins. We recently isolated a trypsin-type endoprotease, named tryptase Clara, from rat bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells, which is secreted into the airway lumen and activates Sendai virus and influenza A virus proteolytically. We report here that surfactant in the bronchial fluid inhibited tryptase Clara specifically, having a Ki value of 0.13 microM, and inhibited the proteolytic activations by tryptase Clara in vitro and in organ cultures of rat lung. Intranasal infection of rats with Sendai virus was shown to stimulate secretion of tryptase Clara without changing the amount of surfactant in the bronchial lumen, resulting in a preferable condition for proteolytic viral activation and multiplication.

Title: Rates of spontaneous mutation among RNA viruses.
Abstract: Simple methods are presented to estimate rates of spontaneous mutation from mutant frequencies and population parameters in RNA viruses. Published mutant frequencies yield a wide range of mutation rates per genome per replication, mainly because mutational targets have usually been small and, thus, poor samples of the mutability of the average base. Nevertheless, there is a clear central tendency for lytic RNA viruses (bacteriophage Q beta, poliomyelitis, vesicular stomatitis, and influenza A) to display rates of spontaneous mutation of approximately 1 per genome per replication. This rate is some 300-fold higher than previously reported for DNA-based microbes. Lytic RNA viruses thus mutate at a rate close to the maximum value compatible with viability. Retroviruses (spleen necrosis, murine leukemia, Rous sarcoma), however, mutate at an average rate about an order of magnitude lower than lytic RNA viruses.

Title: Targeted delivery of peptide epitopes to class I major histocompatibility molecules by a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin.
Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressing the CD8 surface marker recognize peptides in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Although most peptides expressed on MHC class I molecules are derived from self- or virally encoded proteins, delivery of exogenous proteins to the cytosol can result in their being processed for presentation to CTLs on MHC class I molecules. We describe two fusion proteins (PEMa and PENP), consisting of the binding and translocating domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE), fused to peptide epitopes from influenza A matrix protein and nucleoprotein, respectively. These fusion proteins were internalized and processed by MHC class I-positive target cells, resulting in sensitization of target cells for lysis by peptide-specific CTLs. A point mutation known to interfere with intoxication by wild-type PE also reduced the ability of PEMa to sensitize target cells. Fusion of peptide or polypeptide epitopes with PE provides a potential means of eliciting CTLs without the use of self-replicating agents, as well as a useful probe for studying MHC class I-restricted antigen processing.

Reason: The paper describes a method to deliver peptide epitopes for immune recognition but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Human mannose-binding protein functions as an opsonin for influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality in yearly epidemics, which result from the ability of the virus to alter the antigenicity of its envelope proteins. Despite the rapid replication of this virus and its ability to infect a wide variety of cell types, viremia is rare and the infection is generally limited to the upper respiratory tract. The preimmune host defense response against IAV is generally, therefore, successful. We have previously provided (and summarized) evidence that neutrophils contribute to defense against IAV, although neutrophil dysfunction and local tissue damage may be less salutory byproducts of this response. Here we provide evidence that the serum lectin mannose-binding protein directly inhibits hemagglutinin activity and infectivity of several strains of IAV. In addition mannose-binding protein acts as an opsonin, enhancing neutrophil reactivity against IAV. Opsonization of IAV by mannose-binding protein also protects the neutrophil from IAV-induced dysfunction. These effects are observed with physiologically relevant concentrations of mannose-binding protein. Two different allelic forms of recombinant mannose-binding protein are found to have similar effects. We believe, on the basis of these data, that mannose-binding protein alone and in conjunction with phagocytic cells is an important constituent of natural immunity (i.e., preimmune defense) against IAV.

Title: Behavioral thermoregulation in mice inoculated with influenza virus.
Abstract: Mice housed at 30 degrees C and inoculated with a mouse-adapted influenza virus show a fall in body temperature (Tb) and a decrease in food intake to almost 0 grams per day. This study tested whether the fall in Tb could be accounted for by the decreased food intake and whether the fall in Tb was due to a decrease of thermoregulatory set point or to an inability to maintain Tb at set point level. The fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice. When food deprived, mice given access to a thermal gradient increased their preference for warmer areas in the gradient and, as a result, Tb did not fall as much as Tb of starved mice not given access to a thermal gradient. When infected with influenza virus, mice given a thermal gradient decreased Tb less and at a slower rate than mice not given a gradient. However, this fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice given a thermal gradient. Mice given a thermal gradient increased their preference for the warmer temperatures after inoculation; this returned to preinoculation preference for cooler temperatures during the later days of infection despite a continuous fall in Tb. Influenza-infected mice given a thermal gradient survived significantly fewer days than infected mice not given a thermal gradient. We conclude that the influenza-induced fall of Tb in mice cannot be explained solely by the decrease in food intake, and is partially due to a decrease in thermoregulatory set point.

Title: Influenza virus A infection induces interleukin-8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells.
Abstract: To determine the role of the airway epithelial cell in mediating virus-induced inflammation, we infected primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells with human influenza type A/Port Chalmers/72 (H3N2). After two days, the medium was collected for measurement of the chemotactic cytokine interleukin-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RNA was extracted from the cells for analysis of interleukin-8 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Interleukin-8 production was more than doubled by viral infection, while interleukin-8 mRNA was increased four-fold. Thus induction of interleukin-8 gene expression in virus-infected airway epithelium may be an important early step leading to virus-induced airway inflammation.

Title: Expression of the influenza A virus M2 protein is restricted to apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells.
Abstract: The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a small, nonglycosylated transmembrane protein that is expressed on surfaces of virus-infected cells. A monoclonal antibody specific for the M2 protein was used to investigate its expression in polarized epithelial cells infected with influenza virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses M2. The expression of M2 on the surfaces of influenza virus-infected cells was found to be restricted to the apical surface, closely paralleling that of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Membrane domain-specific immunoprecipitation indicated that the M2 protein was inserted directly into the apical membrane with transport kinetics similar to those of HA. In polarized cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses M2, we found that 86 to 93% of surface M2 was restricted to the apical domain compared with 88 to 90% of HA in a similar assay. These results indicate that the M2 protein undergoes directional transport in the absence of other influenza virus proteins and that M2 contains the structural features required for apical transport in polarized epithelial cells. The ultrastructural localization of the M2 protein in influenza virus-infected MDCK cells was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy using M2 antibody and a gold conjugate. In cells in which extensive virus budding was occurring, the apical cell membrane was labeled with gold particles evenly distributed between microvilli and the surrounding membrane. In addition, a significant fraction of the M2 label was apparently associated with virions. A monoclonal antibody specific for HA demonstrated a similar labeling pattern. These results indicate that M2 is localized in close proximity to budding and assembled virions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on localization and expression of the influenza A virus M2 protein in polarized epithelial cells without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mechanisms of mouse spleen dendritic cell function in the generation of influenza-specific, cytolytic T lymphocytes.
Abstract: We have evaluated the capacity of dendritic cells to function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for influenza and have examined their mechanism of action. Virus-pulsed dendritic cells were 100 times more efficient than bulk spleen cells in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) formation. The induction of CTLs required neither exogenous lymphokines nor APCs in the responding T cell population. Infectious virus entered dendritic cells through intracellular acidic vacuoles and directed the synthesis of several viral proteins. If ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated or bromelain-treated viruses were used, viral protein synthesis could not be detected, and there was poor induction of CTLs. This indicated that dendritic cells were not capable of processing noninfectious virus onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, UV-inactivated and bromelain-treated viruses were presented efficiently to class II-restricted CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cells crossreacted with different strains of influenza and markedly amplified CTL formation. Cell lines that lacked MHC class II, and consequently the capacity to stimulate CD4+ T cells, failed to induce CTLs unless helper lymphokines were added. Similarly, dendritic cells pulsed with the MHC class I-restricted nucleoprotein 147-155 peptide were poor stimulators in the absence of exogenous helper factors. We conclude that the function of dendritic cells as APCs for the generation of virus-specific CTLs in vitro depends measurably upon: (a) charging class I molecules with peptides derived from endogenously synthesized viral antigens, and (b) stimulating a strong CD4+ helper T cell response.

Title: Comparison of two reconstituted systems for in vitro transcription and replication of influenza virus.
Abstract: The transcription and replication of influenza RNA can be studied in vitro by the reconstitution of functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from viral core proteins including the RNA polymerase (complex of three P protein subunits) and nucleoprotein (NP), and model templates. Here, two different core protein preparations, one based on CsCl centrifugation (CS enzyme) and the other on micrococcal nuclease treatment of viral cores (MN enzyme), were compared side-by-side. Short model RNA templates and their 3'-half molecules of both viral RNA (vRNA) and complementary RNA (cRNA) senses were reconstituted with the core protein preparations in parallel, and RNA polymerase activity was tested either in the presence or absence of ApG or globin mRNA as primers. Both enzyme preparations were active in the syntheses of short vRNA and cRNA transcripts using ApG as a primer, although the synthesis of cRNA was 2-10-fold higher (depending on the template used) than the synthesis of vRNA. The MN enzyme, however, was more active per weight of total protein than the CS enzyme, probably because of its higher content of RNA polymerase. Both enzymes failed to show primer-independent synthesis of vRNA. The differences observed in the synthesis of short transcripts using globin mRNA as a primer are discussed.

Title: Comparison of different approaches to measuring influenza A virus-specific hemagglutination inhibition antibodies in the presence of serum inhibitors.
Abstract: The A/Los Angeles/2/87 (H3N2) (A/LA/2/87) virus is sensitive to inhibitors of hemagglutination present in certain human sera. It was found that the effect of these inhibitors could be removed by treating sera with high-concentration receptor-destroying enzyme or trypsin-periodate or by using inhibitor-resistant viruses in the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test. Inhibitor-resistant viruses were not effective for detecting rises in antibody titers in the sera of volunteers infected with the A/LA/2/87 wild-type virus, while rises in antibody titer were readily detected in sera treated with trypsin-periodate and tested against A/LA/2/87 wild-type virus in an HAI test. It is therefore suggested that chemical or enzymatic methods be used to inactivate serum inhibitors and that standard virus be used in the HAI test for the currently circulating H3N2 viruses.

Title: Infectious Sindbis virus transient expression vectors for studying antigen processing and presentation.
Abstract: Sindbis virus (SIN) is a small positive-strand enveloped RNA virus that infects a broad range of vertebrate and insect cells. A SIN vector (called dsSIN), designed for transient expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins, was engineered by inserting a second subgenomic mRNA promoter sequence into a nonessential region of the SIN genome. By using this vector, dsSIN recombinants have been constructed that express either bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a truncated form of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), or mini-genes encoding two distinct immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) HA epitopes. Infection of murine cell lines with these recombinants resulted in the expression of approximately 10(6)-10(7) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polypeptides per cell and efficient sensitization of target cells for lysis by appropriate major histocompatibility complex-restricted HA-specific CTL clones in vitro. In addition, priming of an influenza-specific T-cell response was observed after immunizing mice with dsSIN recombinants expressing either a truncated form of HA or the immunodominant influenza CTL epitopes. This SIN expression system allows the generation of high-titered recombinant virus stocks in a matter of days and should facilitate mapping and mutational analysis of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell epitopes expressed via the endogenous pathway of antigen processing and presentation.

Title: Activity of CD4+ T-cell clones of type 1 and type 2 in generation of influenza virus-specific cytotoxic responses in vitro.
Abstract: The activity of distinct CD4+ T-helper cell (Th) clones in promoting secondary A/PR/8/34/Mt.S.(H1N1) (A/PR8) influenza virus-specific, class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro was examined. CD8+ T cells which had been purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter from spleen cells of A/PR8-primed mice were used as responders. On their own, purified CD8+ T cells were unable to generate cytotoxic activity upon in vitro culture with A/PR8-infected stimulator cells. Significant cytotoxic activity was generated in cultures that were additionally supplemented with A/PR8-specific Th clones or cell-free supernatant from these clones. Although there were large differences among individual Th clones in this function, Th clones of type 1 (Th1) promoted, on average, significantly stronger cytotoxic responses than Th clones of type 2 (Th2). The differences in promotion of a cytotoxic response correlated with the amount of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4 secreted by individual Th clones. These two lymphokines accounted for the CTL-promoting activity of the respective Th clones, since addition of recombinant IL-2 (IL-2) or rIL-4 to Th-free cultures substituted fully for the respective Th clones. As observed with Th clones, rIL-2 was significantly more effective than rIL-4 in promoting a cytotoxic response. When used in combination, Th2 clones had an antagonistic effect on the generation of a CTL response by Th1 clones. This effect could be partially transferred with cell-free supernatant from activated Th2 clones and could be reversed by addition of excess rIL-2. Both consumption of IL-2 by Th2 and secretion of an inhibitory factor(s) appear to be involved in this phenomenon.

Title: Antiviral activity of some natural and synthetic sugar analogues.
Abstract: A number of natural and synthetic sugar analogues have been tested for their antiviral activity, using an influenza virus strain as a model. Hemagglutinating titres (HA) and cytopathic effect (CPE) were surveyed to estimate the virus production. It was found that introduction of the benzyl group into these sugars generally causes them to become antivirally active. Substitution with methyl, acetyl, uridyl and thiocyanyl groups or derivatization with azido, isopropylidene and benzylidene groups were without effect. All sugars containing the 2-deoxy-2-acetamido group were inactive.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper tests antiviral activity of sugar analogues against influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Folding of influenza hemagglutinin in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Abstract: The folding of influenza hemagglutinin (HA0) in the ER was analyzed in tissue culture cells by following the formation of intrachain disulfides after short (1 min) radioactive pulses. While some disulfide bonds were already formed on the nascent chains, the subunits acquired their final disulfide composition and antigenic epitopes posttranslationally. Two posttranslational folding intermediates were identified. In CHO cells constitutively expressing HA0, mature HA0 subunits were formed with a half time of 3 min and their folding reached completion at 22 min. The rate of folding was highly dependent on cell type and expression system, and thus regulated by factors other than the sequence of the protein alone. Exposure of cells to stress conditions increased the level of glucose regulated proteins, including BiP, and decreased the folding rate. The efficiency of folding and subsequent trimerization was not dependent on the rate of translation, nor on temperature between 37 and 15 degrees C; however, the rates of folding and trimerization decreased with decreasing temperature. Whereas the rate of folding was independent of expression level, trimerization was accelerated at higher levels of expression.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates folding of influenza hemagglutinin in the endoplasmic reticulum but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antibody recognition of an immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin-human leukocyte antigen class II complex.
Abstract: The A/Japan/57 influenza hemagglutin (HA) peptide HA 128-145, when bound by human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-DRw11 cells, is recognized by the human CD4+ T cell clone V1. A rabbit antiserum has been raised against HA 128-145 which recognizes not only the free peptide, but also the HA 128-145/DRw11 complex on a solid matrix, in solution, or on the surface of viable cells. The detection of these complexes on viable cells was shown to be class II specific, DRw11 restricted, and commensurate with the level of DRw11 expression. The identity of DRw11 as the cell surface molecule binding HA 128-145 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and tryptic peptide mapping. Using this antiserum HA 128-145/DRw11 complexes could be detected on the cell surface as soon as 30 min after the peptide was added, and increased up to 24 h. Dissociation kinetics showed these complexes were long-lived, with a half-life of approximately 14 h. This anti-HA peptide antiserum represents the first direct means of studying antigenic peptide-human leukocyte antigen class II complexes on the surface of living cells without the addition of a non-amino acid moiety to the peptide. The properties of this antiserum thus provide the potential to study naturally processed antigenic peptides as well as the mechanism of processing itself in a physiologically relevant system.

Title: Cell surface transport, oligomerization, and endocytosis of chimeric type II glycoproteins: role of cytoplasmic and anchor domains.
Abstract: We investigated the role of cytoplasmic and anchor domains of type II glycoproteins in intracellular transport, oligomerization, and endocytosis by expressing the wild-type and chimeric genes in mammalian cells. Chimeric genes were constructed by exchanging the DNA segments that encode the cytoplasmic and anchor domains between the human influenza virus (A/WSN/33) neuraminidase (NA) and transferrin receptor (TR). The chimeric proteins in which domains were exchanged precisely were productively targeted to the cell surface. However, the proteins appeared to assemble differently in the intracellular compartment. For example, while TR existed predominantly as a dimer, NATR delta 90, containing the cytoplasmic and signal-anchor domains of NA and the ectodomain of TR, was present as a tetramer, a dimer, and a monomer. Similarly, the influenza virus NA existed predominantly as a tetramer but TRNA delta 35, in which the cytoplasmic and signal-anchor domains of TR were joined to the ectodomain of NA, existed predominantly as a dimer, suggesting that the cytoplasmic and anchor domains of type II glycoproteins affect the subunit assembly of heterologous ectodomains. In addition, we analyzed the role of the cytoplasmic domain in endocytosis. NA and NATR delta 90 did not undergo endocytosis, whereas both TR and TRNA delta 35 were internalized efficiently, demonstrating that the NH2 cytoplasmic domain of TR was capable of internalizing a heterologous ectodomain (NA) from the cell surface.

Reason: The paper studies intracellular transport and oligomerization of chimeric glycoproteins, focusing on protein domains rather than linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Abstract: The two step nature of the binding reaction between trypsin and viral glycoproteins was further investigated using two types of trypsin, bovine trypsin and Streptomyces griseus trypsin. The experimental results were explained by the van der Waals energy operating in the second step, suggesting that the conformational aspects, in addition to the electrostatic nature, of the interacting peptides are decisive in this specific process.

Title: Determination of influenza virus proteins required for genome replication.
Abstract: An artificial vaccinia virus vector-driven replication system for influenza virus RNA has been developed. In this system, a synthetic NS-like gene is replicated and expressed by influenza virus proteins supplied through infection with vaccinia virus recombinant vectors. The minimum subset of influenza virus proteins needed for specific replication and expression of the viral ribonucleoprotein was found to be the three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) and the nucleoprotein.

Title: The immunogenicity of VP7, a rotavirus antigen resident in the endoplasmic reticulum, is enhanced by cell surface expression.
Abstract: The glycoprotein VP7, the major serotype antigen of rotaviruses, is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cell, where it is retained as a membrane-associated protein before assembly into mature virus particles. Wild-type VP7 expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus was also located internally and was poorly antigenic. Using recombinant techniques, a correctly processed, secreted form of VP7 (S.C. Stirzaker and G.W. Both, Cell 56:741-747, 1989) was modified by addition to its C terminus of the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic domains from the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The hybrid protein was directed to the surface of cells, where it was anchored in the plasma membrane. When expressed in mice and rabbits by a recombinant vaccinia virus, the surface-anchored antigen stimulated a level of rotavirus-specific antibodies that was greater than 100-fold above the level induced by wild-type VP7. T-cell responses to the novel antigen were also elevated in comparison with the wild-type, intracellular protein. Cell surface anchoring may provide a strategy to increase the immunogenicity of intracellular antigens from other parasites and viruses.

Reason: The study enhances immunogenicity of a rotavirus antigen by cell surface expression using influenza HA domains, but does not link viral genotype to phenotype.

Title: Peptide binding to HLA-DR1: a peptide with most residues substituted to alanine retains MHC binding.
Abstract: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins play an important role in the development of an effective immune response. An important MHC function is the ability to bind and present 'processed antigens' (peptides) to T cells. We show here that the purified human class II MHC molecule, HLA-DR1, binds peptides that have been shown to be immunogenic in vivo. Detergent-solubilized HLA-DR1 and a papain-cleaved form of the protein lacking the transmembrane and intracellular regions have similar peptide binding properties. A total of 39 single substitutions were made throughout an HLA-DR1 restricted hemagglutinin epitope and the results determine one amino acid in this peptide which is crucial to binding. Based on this analysis, a synthetic peptide was designed containing two residues from the original hemagglutinin epitope embedded in a chain of polyalanine. This peptide binds to HLA-DR1, indicating that the majority of peptide side chains are not required for high affinity peptide binding.
Relevant: False

Non-modified antibodies do not produce any effect on virus reproduction.

Title: Molecular mechanism of complex infection by bacteria and virus analyzed by a model using serratial protease and influenza virus in mice.
Abstract: We examined the effect of a serratial exoprotease on the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in mice as a model of complicated respiratory infection by bacteria and virus in humans. The 56-kilodalton (56-kDa) protease from Serratia marcescens was administrated intranasally to mice at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 micrograms from day 0 to day 3 after inoculation of the influenza virus. Administration of the protease resulted in remarkable enhancement of the lethal effect of the virus and enhancement of pathological changes in the lungs. Influenza virus replication, determined by plaque-forming assay, was accelerated by the protease. Namely, we found a 100-fold increase in virus yield by day 2. The 56-kDa protease caused generation of plasmin activity in the lungs. In vitro experiments showed that plasmin greatly enhanced the yield of influenza virus, although the effect of the 56-kDa protease by itself was much lower than that of plasmin. Furthermore, the 56-kDa protease could induce plasmin production indirectly via activation of plasminogen by the Hageman factor-dependent cascade in the in vitro system. We conclude that this major serratial exoprotease has a deleterious effect on mice infected with influenza virus and that this effect seems to result from enhancement of viral growth by indirect acceleration of plasmin generation induced by the protease.

Reason: The paper focuses on the effect of bacterial protease on viral replication and pathogenesis but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Comparison of the virologic and immunologic responses of volunteers to live avian-human influenza A H3N2 reassortant virus vaccines derived from two different avian influenza virus donors.
Abstract: We compared the abilities of the six internal RNA segments of two avian influenza viruses, A/Mallard/Alberta/88/76 (H3N8) and A/Mallard/NY/6750/78 (H2N2), to confer attenuation on wild-type human influenza A/Bethesda/1/85 (H3N2) virus in seronegative adult volunteers. Live avian-human influenza A reassortant virus vaccines derived from either avian virus parent were comparable in the following properties: safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, and genetic stability. Since the avian influenza A/Mallard/Alberta/76 virus offered no clear advantage as a donor virus, we will conduct our future evaluations on live influenza A virus reassortants derived from the more extensively characterized avian influenza A/Mallard/NY/78 virus.

Title: Redundancy of signal and anchor functions in the NH2-terminal uncharged region of influenza virus neuraminidase, a class II membrane glycoprotein.
Abstract: Class II membrane glycoproteins share a common topology of the NH2 terminus inside and the COOH terminus outside the cell. Their transport to the cell surface is initiated by the function of a single hydrophobic domain near the NH2 terminus. This functional domain serves both as an uncleaved signal sequence and as a transmembrane anchor. We examined the signal and anchor functions of influenza virus neuraminidase, a prototype class II membrane glycoprotein, by deletion analysis of its long, uncharged amino-terminal region. The results presented here show that the entire stretch of 29 uncharged amino acids (7 to 35) is not required for either a signal sequence or an anchor sequence function. On the basis of translocation and membrane stability data for different mutants, we suggest that the first 20 amino acid residues (7 to 27) are likely to provide the hydrophobic core for these functions and that within this putative subdomain some sequences are more efficient than the other sequences in providing a translocation function. Finally, it appears that neuraminidase and its mutant proteins are translocated with the proper orientation, regardless of the characteristics of the flanking sequences.

Title: Two nuclear location signals in the influenza virus NS1 nonstructural protein.
Abstract: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus has been shown to enter and accumulate in the nuclei of virus-infected cells independently of any other influenza viral protein. Therefore, the NS1 protein contains within its polypeptide sequence the information that codes for its nuclear localization. To define the nuclear signal of the NS1 protein, a series of recombinant simian virus 40 vectors that express deletion mutants or fusion proteins was constructed. Analysis of the proteins expressed resulted in identification of two regions of the NS1 protein which affect its cellular location. Nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1) contains the stretch of basic amino acids Asp-Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg (codons 34 to 38). This sequence is conserved in all NS1 proteins of influenza A viruses, as well as in that of influenza B viruses. NLS2 is defined within the region between amino acids 203 and 237. This domain is present in the NS1 proteins of most influenza A virus strains. NLS1 and NLS2 contain basic amino acids and are similar to previously defined nuclear signal sequences of other proteins.
Relevant: False

Title: A family of interferon-induced Mx-related mRNAs encodes cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in rat cells.
Abstract: Mouse Mx protein, an interferon (IFN)-induced nuclear protein, confers selective resistance to influenza virus. We show here that, as with influenza virus-resistant Mx+ mouse embryo cells, influenza virus mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis are strongly inhibited in rat embryo cells treated with IFN-alpha/beta. IFN-alpha/beta induced in rat cells the synthesis of Mx-related mRNAs migrating on Northern (RNA) gels as two bands of about 3.5 and 2.5 kilobases which directed the synthesis of three electrophoretically distinct proteins called rat Mx proteins 1, 2, and 3. The three rat proteins were antigenically related to the mouse Mx protein but differed in molecular weight and intracellular location. Rat Mx protein 1 was found predominantly in the nucleus and, on the basis of several criteria, resembled the nuclear mouse Mx protein. It was induced by IFN-alpha/beta in all 28 inbred rat strains tested. Rat Mx proteins 2 and 3 differed from protein 1 at the carboxy terminus and were predominantly cytoplasmic like the human Mx homolog. Sequence data of partial cDNA clones indicate that three Mx-related genes, rather than one, exist in the rat.

Title: Synthesis of viral proteins in polymorphonuclear leukocytes infected with influenza A virus.
Abstract: Various reports have indicated that infection of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) with influenza virus causes depression of their metabolic and chemotactic responses, but the effect the PMNL has on the life cycle of influenza virus has not been well defined. The studies reported here were undertaken to determine whether influenza virus could replicate within PMNL. Virus-infected and uninfected PMNL were labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography for detection of newly synthesized proteins. Both host- and virus-specific proteins were produced within PMNL. By using indirect immunofluorescence techniques combined with flow cytometry, the expression of newly synthesized viral antigens was detected in virus-infected PMNL. Plaque assays on supernatant fluid from infected PMNL showed that infectious progeny were not produced, indicating that influenza virus infection of PMNL is abortive.

Title: Influenza virus RNA replication in vitro: synthesis of viral template RNAs and virion RNAs in the absence of an added primer.
Abstract: The two steps in influenza virus RNA replication are (i) the synthesis of template RNAs, i.e., full-length copies of the virion RNAs, and (ii) the copying of these template RNAs into new virion RNAs. We prepared nuclear extracts from infected HeLa cells that catalyzed both template RNA and virion RNA synthesis in vitro in the absence of an added primer. Antibody depletion experiments implicated nucleocapsid protein molecules not associated with nucleocapsids in template RNA synthesis for antitermination at the polyadenylation site used during viral mRNA synthesis. Experiments with the WSN influenza virus temperature-sensitive mutant ts56 containing a defect in the nucleocapsid protein proved that the nucleocapsid protein was indeed required for template RNA synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Nuclear extracts prepared from mutant virus-infected cells synthesized template RNA at the permissive temperature but not at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas the synthesis of mRNA-size transcripts was not decreased at the nonpermissive temperature. Antibody depletion experiments showed that nucleocapsid protein molecules not associated with nucleocapsids were also required for the copying of template RNA into virion RNA. In contrast to the situation with the synthesis of transcripts complementary to virion RNA, no discrete termination product(s) were made during virion RNA synthesis in vitro in the absence of nucleocapsid protein molecules.

Title: Comparative activities of several nucleoside analogs against influenza A, B, and C viruses in vitro.
Abstract: A set of 20 nucleoside analogs were examined for their inhibitory effects on the cytopathogenicity and growth of influenza virus type A, B, and C strains in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Among the compounds evaluated, pyrazofurin, 3-deazaguanine, ribavirin, carbodine, and cyclopentenyl cytosine inhibited viral cytopathogenicity at concentrations that were lower than those found cytotoxic for the MDCK cells. No differences were observed in the 50% effective doses (based on inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity) of these five compounds for a number of influenza virus type A (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2), B, and C strains. Pyrazofurin showed the lowest 50% effective dose (0.15 microgram/ml), which was about 20- to 30-fold lower than those of the other four compounds. The selectivity indices of the five compounds, calculated as the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic dose (determined by trypan blue exclusion) to the 50% effective dose, were greater than 100. When the selectivity indices were calculated as the ratios of the 50% inhibitory doses for cellular RNA synthesis to the 50% effective doses, they were greater than 100 for ribavirin, pyrazofurin, and 3-deazaguanine but less than 2 for carbodine and cyclopentenyl cytosine. All five compounds inhibited the growth of influenza virus types A and B in MDCK cells at a concentration which was well below their cytotoxicity threshold for MDCK cells and, therefore, deserve further exploration for their potential in the treatment of influenza virus type A, B, and C infections.

Title: Human and bovine coronaviruses recognize sialic acid-containing receptors similar to those of influenza C viruses.
Abstract: Human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus elute from agglutinated chicken erythrocytes when incubated at 37 degrees C, suggesting the presence of a receptor-destroying enzyme. Moreover, bovine coronavirus exhibits an acetylesterase activity in vitro using bovine submaxillary mucin as substrate similar to the enzymatic activity found in influenza C viruses. Furthermore, pretreatment of erythrocytes with either influenza C virus or bovine coronavirus eliminates subsequent binding and agglutination by either coronaviruses or influenza C virus, whereas binding of influenza A virus remains intact. In addition, hemagglutination by coronaviruses can be inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with Arthrobacter ureafaciens or Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase or by addition of sialic acid-containing gangliosides. These results suggest that, like influenza C viruses, human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus recognize O-acetylated sialic acid or a similar derivative as cell receptor.

Title: Influenza virus infection of tracheal gland cells in culture.
Abstract: Influenza virus-induced tracheobronchitis causes limited epithelial deciliation but markedly decreased mucociliary transport. This suggests that virus-induced alterations in airway mucus play a role in decreased mucociliary transport. Airway submucosal glands are a primary source of mucus. Therefore, we examined virus-gland cell interactions by exposing primary cultures of isolated feline tracheal gland cells to influenza A/Scotland/840/74 H3N2 virus for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Virus production and release into the culture medium first occurred between 8 and 12 h postinfection and eventually reached a steady state that continued for at least 8 days. Virus which was produced and released by infected cells infected other monolayers, resulting in viral production similar to that after infection with stock virus. Hemadsorption assays conducted 24 h after infection demonstrated that most of the cells in a monolayer became infected. The infection was nonlytic according to cell morphology, trypan blue dye exclusion, and release of lactate dehydrogenase. Because lysis of a cell subpopulation could have been masked by subsequent cell division, we compared the uptake of [3H]thymidine by infected and control monolayers. There was no increase in uptake by infected monolayers. These results demonstrate that feline tracheal gland cells in primary culture undergo productive and nonlytic infection with influenza A virus. This model provides a unique system for the study of virus-gland interactions isolated from the influence of other tissues.

Title: Antibody-mediated growth of influenza A NWS virus in macrophagelike cell line P388D1.
Abstract: We investigated the internalization and growth of influenza A NWS virus in macrophagelike P388D1 cells. Flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled virus showed that the attachment of normal rabbit serum-exposed virus (NS-V) to neuraminidase (NA)-treated cells was noticeably limited compared with that to untreated cells. However, rabbit antiserum-exposed virus (AS-V) could attach equally well to both cells. Virus coated with Fab prepared from antiviral immunoglobulin G could not attach. These data suggest that the NWS virus can infect P388D1 cells in one of two ways, via viral or via Fc receptors, depending on the presence of antibodies. The NS-V could grow in the untreated cells, but not in the NA-treated cells. The highest growth of AS-V in the NA-treated cells was observed at an antibody concentration showing 50% plaque reduction titer. Growth was exponentially decreased toward the lower and higher dilutions of antibodies. By using three different immunoglobulin G subclasses of monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin, it was demonstrated that both Fc receptors I and II could take part in this phenomenon. The presence of 20 mM NH4Cl inhibited the growth of both AS-V and NS-V, suggesting that the intracellular pathways after internalization via Fc or viral receptors are similar. These data indicate that the concentration of antibodies has a critical role on the antibody-mediated growth of influenza virus in macrophages.

Title: Sequential infection or immunization of ferrets with a series of influenza A (H3N2) strains (report to the Medical Research Council's Sub-Committee on influenza Vaccines (CDVIP/IV)).
Abstract: Previous studies of boys at Christ's Hospital school have indicated that annual immunization with influenza virus vaccines did not significantly reduce the total incidence of influenza infection compared to unimmunized subjects. In view of the implications of this result, a similar study was conducted in ferrets to clarify these findings. Groups of ferrets were immunized or infected with a series of influenza A (H3N2) viruses over an 18-month period, and the immunity to subsequent live virus challenge was measured after each virus or vaccine exposure. The results indicated that live virus infection gave a more solid immunity than immunization with inactivated vaccine; and the serum haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response was greater following immunization than following infection. In addition, differences in immunity could not be explained by measurements of cross-reacting and specific antibody, since the incidence of these antibodies was similar in both infected and immunized animals. The results do not suggest an explanation for the different levels of immunity induced following infection or immunization or the results obtained from the Christ's Hospital study. However, the relative contribution of various immune responses to virus or virus antigen is discussed, and it is suggested that the difference in immunity may lie in the ability of live virus infection to stimulate local antibody.

Title: Reconstitution of functional influenza virus envelopes and fusion with membranes and liposomes lacking virus receptors.
Abstract: Reconstituted influenza virus envelopes were obtained following solubilization of intact virions with Triton X-100. Quantitative determination revealed that the hemolytic and fusogenic activities of the envelopes prepared by the present method were close or identical to those expressed by intact virions. Hemolysis as well as virus-membrane fusion occurred only at low pH values, while both activities were negligible at neutral pH values. Fusion of intact virions as well as reconstituted envelopes with erythrocyte membranes--and also with liposomes--was determined by the use of fluorescently labeled viral envelopes and fluorescence dequenching measurements. Fusion with liposomes did not require the presence of specific virus receptors, namely sialoglycolipids. Under hypotonic conditions, influenza virions or their reconstituted envelopes were able to fuse with erythrocyte membranes from which virus receptors had been removed by treatment with neuraminidase and pronase. Inactivated intact virions or reconstituted envelopes, namely, envelopes treated with hydroxylamine or glutaraldehyde or incubated at low pH or 85 degrees C, neither caused hemolysis nor possessed fusogenic activity. Fluorescence dequenching measurements showed that only fusion with liposomes composed of neutral phospholipids and containing cholesterol reflected the viral fusogenic activity needed for infection.

Title: Defective interfering virus associated with A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/83 influenza virus.
Abstract: The A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/1/83 influenza virus, isolated from a respiratory infection of chickens, is an avirulent H5N2 virus containing subgenomic RNAs (W.J. Bean, Y. Kawaoka, J.M. Wood, J.E. Pearson, and R.G. Webster, J. Virol. 54:151-160, 1985). We show here that defective interfering particles are present in this virus population. The virus had a low ratio of plaque-forming to hemagglutinating units and produced interference with standard virus multiplication in infectious center reduction assays. Subgenomic RNAs were identified as internally deleted polymerase RNAs. We have confirmed that this virus protects chickens from lethal H5N2 influenza virus infection. This protective effect appeared to be due to the inhibition of virulent virus multiplication. Additionally, subgenomic RNAs derived from polymerase RNAs were detected in 5 of 18 RNA preparations from animal influenza virus isolates. Therefore, defective interfering particles are sometimes produced in natural influenza virus infections, not just under laboratory conditions. These particles may be capable of suppressing the pathogenic effect of virulent virus infections in nature.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports defective interfering particles in influenza virus populations but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza virus gene expression: control mechanisms at early and late times of infection and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of virus-specific RNAs.
Abstract: Single-stranded M13 DNAs specific for various influenza virus genomic segments were used to analyze the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs in infected cells. The results show that influenza virus infection is divided into two distinct phases. During the early phase, the syntheses of specific virion RNAs, viral mRNAs, and viral proteins were coupled. Thus, the NS (nonstructural) virion RNA was preferentially synthesized early, leading to the preferential synthesis of NS1 viral mRNA and NS1 protein; in contrast, M (matrix) RNA synthesis was delayed, leading to the delayed synthesis of M1 viral mRNA and M1 protein. This phase lasted for 2.5 h in BHK-21 cells, the time at which the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs was maximal. During the second phase, the synthesis of all the virion RNAs remained at or near maximum until at least 5.5 h postinfection, whereas the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs declined dramatically. By 4.5 h, the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs was 5% of the maximum rate. Viral mRNA and protein syntheses were also not coupled, as the synthesis of all the viral proteins continued at maximum levels, indicating that protein synthesis during this phase was directed principally by previously synthesized viral mRNAs. Short pulses (3 min) with [3H]uridine and nonaqueous fractionation of cells were used to show that influenza virion RNA synthesis occurred in the nucleus, demonstrating that all virus-specific RNA synthesis was nuclear. Virion RNAs, like viral mRNAs, were efficiently transported to the cytoplasm at both early and late times of infection. In contrast, the full-length transcripts of the virion RNAs, which are the templates for virion RNA synthesis, were sequestered in the nucleus. Thus, the template RNAs, which were synthesized only at early times, remained in the nucleus to direct virion RNA synthesis throughout infection. These results enabled us to present an overall scheme for the control of influenza virus gene expression.

Title: Microtubule-acting drugs lead to the nonpolarized delivery of the influenza hemagglutinin to the cell surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.
Abstract: The synchronized directed transfer of the envelope glycoproteins of the influenza and vesicular stomatitis viruses from the Golgi apparatus to the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells can be achieved using temperature-sensitive mutant viruses and appropriate temperature shift protocols (Rindler, M. J., I. E. Ivanov, H. Plesken, and D. D. Sabatini, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 100:136-151). The microtubule-depolymerizing agents colchicine and nocodazole, as well as the microtubule assembly-promoting drug taxol, were found to interfere with the normal polarized delivery and exclusive segregation of hemagglutinin (HA) to the apical surface but not with the delivery and initial accumulation of G on the basolateral surface. Immunofluorescence analysis of permeabilized monolayers of influenza-infected MDCK cells treated with the microtubule-acting drugs demonstrated the presence of substantial amounts of HA protein on both the apical and basolateral surfaces. Moreover, in cells infected with the wild-type influenza virus, particles budded from both surfaces. Viral counts in electron micrographs showed that approximately 40% of the released viral particles accumulated in the intercellular spaces or were trapped between the cell and monolayer and the collagen support as compared to less than 1% on the basolateral surface of untreated infected cells. The effect of the microtubule inhibitors was not a result of a rapid redistribution of glycoprotein molecules initially delivered to the apical surface since a redistribution was not observed when the inhibitors were added to the cells after the HA was permitted to reach the apical surface at the permissive temperature and the synthesis of new HA was inhibited with cycloheximide. The altered segregation of the HA protein that occurs may result from the dispersal of the Golgi apparatus induced by the inhibitors or from the disruption of putative microtubules containing tracks that could direct vesicles from the trans Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Since the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein is basolaterally segregated even when the Golgi elements are dispersed and hypothetical tracks disrupted, it appears that the two viral envelope glycoproteins are segregated by fundamentally different mechanisms and that the apical surface may be incapable of accepting vesicles carrying the G protein.

Title: An influenza virus inhibitor that acts late in the replication cycle.
Abstract: An inhibitor which is active against influenza A virus was found in Neuramide, a complex tissue extract that is used as an anti-herpes zoster virus treatment. Kinetic studies showed that significant inhibition of virus production occurred when the inhibitor was added to infected cultures up to 5 h after virus penetration. Molecular sieving fractionation showed that the antiviral activity was contained in a low-molecular-weight fraction (molecular weight, less than 1,000).

Title: The antiviral activity of tetrazole phosphonic acids and their analogues.
Abstract: 5-(Phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole and a number of related tetrazoles have been prepared and their effects on the replication of Herpes Simplex Viruses-1 and -2 have been investigated as well as their abilities to inhibit the DNA polymerases induced by these viruses and the RNA transcriptase activity of influenza virus A. Contrary to an earlier report, 5-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole was not an efficient inhibitor of the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in tissue culture. Analogues of 5-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole were also devoid of significant antiviral activity. Only 5-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole and 5-(thiophosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole inhibited the influenza virus transcriptase, and both were more effective as inhibitors than phosphonoacetic acid under the same conditions. The DNA polymerases induced by HSV-1 and HSV-2 were inhibited slightly by 5-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole and to a lesser extent by its N-ethyl analogue and 3-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole. None of these compounds were as effective as phosphonoacetic acid. 5-(Thiophosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole was a better inhibitor of the DNA polymerase induced by HSV-1 than 5-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-tetrazole.

Title: Effect of human alpha A interferon on influenza virus replication in MDBK cells.
Abstract: To determine the molecular mechanism whereby interferon induces resistance to influenza virus, we began an investigation of influenza virus replication in MDBK cells treated with recombinant human alpha A interferon. Negative- and positive-strand virus-specific RNA accumulation was monitored by blot hybridization with cloned probes. Primary transcription (transcription of infecting viral negative strands by the virion-associated polymerase) was inhibited by interferon treatment of MDBK cells. At moderate levels of interferon treatment (10 U/ml), this inhibition was restricted to transcripts of polymerase genes, whereas at higher levels of interferon treatment (50 U/ml), accumulation of all primary transcripts was markedly inhibited. Secondary transcripts and viral negative strands did not accumulate to any significant extent in interferon-treated MDBK cells. These results suggest that interferon-induced mechanisms which inhibit influenza virus replication in MDBK cells act at the level of primary transcription.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the effect of interferon on influenza virus replication, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A primer vector system that allows temperature dependent gene amplification and expression in mammalian cells: regulation of the influenza virus NS1 gene expression.
Abstract: Influenza virus RNA segment 8 has been cloned into primer-vector pSLts1. This vector was designed to replicate in simian cells in a temperature dependent fashion by use of the SV40 tsA209 T-antigen gene. The oriented synthesis of cDNA on dT-tailed pSLts1 was performed on in vitro synthesized mRNA, and the second DNA strand was primed with an influenza-specific terminal oligodeoxynucleotide. Recombinant pSLVa232 contained the RNA segment 8 sequence directly fused to the SV40 late promoter contained in pSLts1, and followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Expression of NS1 gene in transfected COS cells took place at a level comparable to that found in infected cells. When VERO cell cultures were transfected with recombinant pSLVa232, expression of the NS1 gene was temperature dependent. Close to one hundred fold increase in the amplification and expression of the cloned gene was observed after shift down of the transfected cells to permissive temperature. Vector pSLts1 and the cloning strategy described may be useful for the specific cloning and regulated expression of mRNAs of known 5'-terminal sequence.

Title: Cell surface influenza haemagglutinin can mediate infection by other animal viruses.
Abstract: We have used filter-grown Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to explore the mechanism by which influenza virus facilitates secondary virus infection. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infect only through the basolateral surface of these polarized epithelial cells and not through the apical surface. Prior infection with influenza virus rendered the cell susceptible to infection by VSV or SFV through either surface. The presence of both a permissive and a restrictive surface for virus entry in the same cell allowed us to determine how the influenza infection enhanced the subsequent infection of a second virus. Biochemical and morphological evidence showed that influenza haemagglutinin on the apical surface serves as a receptor for the superinfecting virus by binding to its sialic acid-bearing envelope proteins. Influenza virus also facilitates secondary virus infection in non-epithelial cells; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), which are normally resistant to infection by the coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus MHV-A59), could be infected via the haemagglutinin-sialic acid interaction. Facilitation of secondary virus infection requires only the sialic acid-binding properties of the haemagglutinin since the uncleaved haemagglutinin could also mediate virus entry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies influenza haemagglutinin-mediated facilitation of secondary virus infection, but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Activity of selenazofurin against influenza A and B viruses in vitro.
Abstract: Activity of the new antiviral compound selenazofurin was compared with the known active compounds ribavirin and amantadine against influenza A and B viruses. In experiments with Madin Darby canine kidney cells, selenazofurin inhibited the cytopathic effect and yield of influenza A/NWS/33 virus, with 50% effective dose ranges of 0.7 to 1.4 micrograms/ml (virus rating [VR], 1.3 to 1.4). The 50% effective dose range for ribavirin was 1.2 to 1.6 micrograms/ml (VR, 1.0 to 1.3), and for amantadine it was 9 micrograms/ml (VR, 0.9). Selenazofurin and ribavirin were similarly inhibitory to influenza B/Lee/40 virus, whereas amantadine was inactive. Selenazofurin appeared somewhat cytotoxic in these studies at concentrations as low as 1 micrograms/ml.

Title: Regulated production of an influenza virus spliced mRNA mediated by virus-specific products.
Abstract: The influenza virus NS2 mRNA is generated through processing by cellular enzymes of a transcript (the NS1 mRNA) of virion RNA segment 8. Production of this mRNA is altered in cells infected with a mutant of influenza A (fowl plague) virus. The proportion of segment 8 transcripts which accumulated in a spliced form was found to be considerably lower in mutant virus-infected cells than in cells infected with wild-type virus, and the amplification in production of NS2 mRNA relative to that of the NS1 mRNA, which normally occurs during infection with wild-type virus, was not observed with the mutant. The NS1 mRNA specified by the mutant virus has unaltered splice recognition sites and was apparently processed normally during a mixed infection with a strain of virus which is wild-type for production of NS2 mRNA. These results suggest that the production of NS2 mRNA is regulated by virus-specific products; these products may act by increasing the efficiency of splicing of NS1 mRNA.

Title: An efficient method for introducing macromolecules into living cells.
Abstract: The hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus was used to obtain efficient and rapid bulk delivery of antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the cytoplasm of living tissue culture cells. By exploiting HA's efficient cell surface expression, its high affinity for erythrocytes, and its acid-dependent membrane fusion activity, a novel delivery method was developed. The approach is unique in that the mediator of both binding and fusion (the HA) is present on the surfaces of the target cells. A recently developed 3T3 cell line which permanently expresses HA, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza virus, and CV-1 cells infected with a simian virus 40 vector carrying the HA gene were used as recipient cells. Protein-loaded erythrocytes were bound to the HA on the cell surface and a brief drop in pH to 5.0 was used to trigger HA's fusion activity and hence delivery. About 3 to 8 erythrocytes fused per 3T3 and CV-1 cell, respectively, and 75-95% of the cells received IgG or HRP. Quantitative analysis showed that 1.8 X 10(8) molecules of HRP and 1.4 X 10(7) IgG molecules were delivered per CV-1 cell and 6.2 X 10(7) HRP molecules per 3T3 cell. Cell viability, as judged by methionine incorporation into protein and cell growth and division, was not impaired. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that the fused erythrocyte membranes remained as discrete domains in the cell's plasma membrane. The method is simple, reliable, and nonlytic. The ability to simultaneously and rapidly deliver impermeable substances into large numbers of cells will permit biochemical analysis of the fate and effect of a variety of delivered molecules.

Title: Development of subtype-specific and heterosubtypic antibodies to the influenza A virus hemagglutinin after primary infection in children.
Abstract: Children undergoing primary infection with an H1N1 or H3N2 influenza A virus developed subtype-specific hemagglutination inhibition antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibodies to purified hemagglutinin (HA) of the infecting virus subtype. They also developed lower titered ELISA antibodies to the noninfecting H1 or H3 HA and to H8 (an avian strain) HA. Thus, after primary infection with an influenza A virus, children develop enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but not hemagglutination inhibition, antibodies reactive with heterosubtypic HAs. These heterosubtypic antibodies could influence the response to infection with other wild-type or attenuated vaccine strains of influenza A virus.

Title: N-Acetylneuraminyllactosylceramide, GM3-NeuAc, a new influenza A virus receptor which mediates the adsorption-fusion process of viral infection. Binding specificity of influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) to membrane-associated GM3 with different molecular species of sialic acid.
Abstract: Agglutinates of native chicken erythrocytes caused by influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) at 4 degrees C were potently fused and lysed at low pH (optimum pH 5.3) at 37 degrees C. Exogenous gangliosides GM3 (Sia alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-ceramide) and GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4(Sia alpha 2-3)-Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-ceramide) were integrated into the membranes of chicken asialoerythrocytes within 5-min incubation at 37 degrees C. We found that the incorporation of ganglioside GM3 containing N-acetylneuraminic acid into asialoerythrocytes restored the biological responsiveness to the virus as established by agglutination at 4 degrees C and fusion and hemolysis at 37 degrees C at pH 5.3. Biological responsiveness of GM3-NeuAc-erythrocytes to the virus was considerably higher than that of GM3-NeuGc-erythrocytes under the same experimental conditions. Treatment of the GM3-NeuAc-erythrocytes with neuraminidase again resulted in the complete abolishment of the response to the virus. Erythrocytes containing GM2-NeuAc showed no detectable biological responses toward the virus. The above results indicate that the hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) recognizes the sialyloligosaccharide chain of ganglioside GM3 as its receptor which mediates the adsorption and fusion process on the virus entry into the host cells and has more preferential specificity for binding to N-acetylneuraminic acid-containing GM3 than that to N-glycolyl type in the target cell membranes.

Title: Sensitization of mice with wild-type and cold-adapted influenza virus variants: immune response to two H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.
Abstract: Two A strain influenza viruses, A/Hong Kong/123/77 (A/HK/123/77) (H1N1) and A/Queensland/6/72 (A/Qld/6/72) (H3N2), and the two cold-adapted reassortants which possess the surface antigens of these strains (CR35 and CR6, respectively) were tested for their ability both to induce primary cytotoxic T-cell (Tc cell) responses in mice and to sensitize mice for a second Tc cell response when challenged with a distantly related A strain virus, A/Shearwater/72 (H6N5). After intranasal inoculation, A/Qld/6/72 replicated to higher titers in the lung (1 to 2 log10 50% egg infective doses) than did A/HK/123/77 or either of the reassortants. A/Qld/6/72 induced higher Tc cell responses in the lung than did CR6, and both were more effective than either A/HK/123/77 or CR35 in this respect. When similar doses (10 or 10(3) hemagglutinin units) of each virus were injected intravenously into mice and the spleens were tested for Tc cell activity 6 days later, both A/Qld/6/72 and CR6 were ca. 100-fold better at inducing a primary Tc cell response than A/HK/123/77 or CR35. In contrast, the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses gave rather similar anti-hemagglutinin antibody titers (after intravenous injection) and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (after subcutaneous injection). If mice were primed with a low dose of these viruses (10(4) 50% egg infective doses intranasally), A/Qld/6/72 and CR6 were more effective than A/HK/123/77 or CR35 at sensitizing for a secondary Tc cell response when challenged with A/Shearwater/72, but if larger doses were given either intranasally (10(6) 50% egg infective doses) or intravenously (10 to 10(3) hemagglutinin units), all viruses sensitized the mice equally well, despite the fact the A/Shearwater/72 gives a poor primary Tc cell response in mice. Thus, the viral glycoprotein antigens can be important in determining the immunogenicity of the virus and, particularly, the class I antigen-restricted Tc cell response of the host.

Title: Inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus by the calcium-specific ionophore A23187.
Abstract: At calcium-specific ionophore A23187 concentrations of approximately 0.25 microM [which still allow assembly and release of fowl plague virus (FPV) particles] post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin precursor HA into the fragments HA1 and HA2 is inhibited. The resulting virus particles with uncleaved hemagglutinin, that cannot be obtained under normal conditions, provide a suitable substrate for in vitro assays of the protease sensitivity of the FPV hemagglutinin. Proteolytic activation is accomplished with trypsin. Treatment with cathepsin B at low pH yields aberrant cleavage products suggesting that the cellular cleavage enzyme is not of lysosomal origin. A protease that cleaves the FPV hemagglutinin in the correct place can be detected in lysates of MDBK cells. This enzyme is calcium dependent and has a neutral pH optimum.

Title: Growth kinetics of equine respiratory tract viruses in cell and organ cultures.
Abstract: Growth kinetics of equine influenza virus-A1, equine herpesvirus-1, and equine rhinovirus-1 were determined in susceptible cell monolayers and in organ cultures of equine fetal tracheal and nasal turbinate epithelium. Equine influenza virus-A1 was replicated in cell and organ cultures and was released more readily and for longer periods from nasal turbinate epithelium than from tracheal epithelium. Equine herpesvirus-1 was also replicated in cell and organ cultures. During the first 24 hours after inoculation, equine herpesvirus-1 was released more readily from tracheal epithelium than from nasal turbinate epithelium. Beyond postinoculation day 1, virus was released more readily and for longer periods from nasal turbinate epithelium than from tracheal epithelium. Equine rhinovirus-1 replicated in cell and organ cultures, but almost exclusively from nasal turbinate epithelium.

Abstract: Organ cultures of equine fetal tracheal and nasal turbinate epithelium were inoculated with equine influenza virus-A1 (EIV-A1), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), or equine rhinovirus-1 (ERV-1). Infected organ cultures were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy at various intervals and were compared with noninfected controls. Organ cultures inoculated with ERV-1 appeared normal with the exception of rare island-like lesions in infected nasal turbinate. Virus particles were not seen in thin sections of organ cultures infected with ERV-1. The EHV-1 caused extensive loss of the epithelial layer in tracheal and nasal turbinate organ cultures. The classic stages of herpesvirus morphogenesis were seen in thin sections of organ cultures infected with EHV-1. The EIV-A1 caused a scattered loss of cilia that was only apparent in infected tracheal organ cultures. Cilia were also seen bound in bundles. In thin sections, EIV-A1 particles were seen budding from the bases of microvilli.

Title: Membrane-bound hemagglutinin mediates antibody and complement-dependent lysis of influenza virus-treated human platelets in autologous serum.
Abstract: Influenza A virus-treated human platelets were lyzed in autologous serum. Lysis required the presence of antibody and occurred predominantly through activation of the classical complement pathway. Binding of the virus followed by its elution at 37 degrees C resulted in a dose-dependent desialation of the cells with a maximal release of 45% of total platelet sialic acid. In contrast, platelets that had been treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase and from which 55% of total sialic acid had been removed were not lyzed in autologous serum and did not bind C3 as shown in binding assays using radiolabeled monoclonal anti-C3 antibody. Thus, the immune-mediated lysis of virus-treated platelets in autologous serum did not involve neoantigens expressed by desialated cells. To assess the effect of viruses on the platelet surface, treated platelets were incubated with galactose oxidase and sodium [3H]borohydride prior to separation and analysis of the labeled glycoproteins by SDS-PAGE. Viral treatment resulted in a desialation of each of the surface glycoproteins. At the same time, a labeled component of Mr 72,000 (nonreduced) and Mr 55,000 (reduced) was observed that was not present when V. cholerae-desialated platelets were examined in the same way. Immunoblotting experiments performed using antiwhole virus and anti-hemagglutinin antibodies demonstrated this component to be viral hemagglutinin. Involvement of membrane-bound hemagglutinin in antibody and in complement-mediated lysis of virus-treated platelets in autologous serum was supported by the increased lytic activity of a postvaccinal serum containing an elevated titer of complement fixing anti-hemagglutinin antibodies. Binding of a viral protein to the platelet surface provides a model for immune thrombocytopenias occurring during acute viral infections at the time of the specific immune response.

Title: NH2-terminal hydrophobic region of influenza virus neuraminidase provides the signal function in translocation.
Abstract: Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA), unlike the majority of integral membrane proteins, does not contain a cleavable signal sequence. It contains an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain that functions as an anchor. We have investigated the signal function for translocation of this NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain of NA by constructing chimeric cDNA clones in which the DNA coding for the first 40 NH2-terminal hydrophobic amino acids of NA was joined to the DNA coding for the signal-minus hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus. The chimeric HA (N4OH) containing the NH2 terminus of NA was expressed in CV1 cells by using a simian virus 40 late-expression vector. The chimeric HA is synthesized, translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and glycosylated, whereas HA lacking the signal sequence is present only in small amounts and is unglycosylated. These results clearly show that the NH2 terminus of NA, in addition to its anchor function, also provides the signal function in translocation. However, the acquisition of complex oligosaccharides and the transport of N4OH to the cell surface are greatly retarded. To determine if the presence of two anchor sequences, one provided by NA at the NH2 terminus and the other provided by HA at the COOH terminus of N4OH, was responsible for the slow transport, the NH2 terminus of NA was fused to an "anchorless" HA. The resulting chimeric HA (N4OH482) contains the hydrophobic domain of NA at the NH2 terminus but lacks the HA anchor at the COOH terminus. N4OH482 was synthesized and glycosylated; however, as with N4OH, the acquisition of complex oligosaccharides and the migration to the cell surface are greatly retarded. Immunofluorescence data also support that, compared to the native HA, only a small amount of chimeric HA proteins is transported to the cell surface. Thus, the hydrophobic NH2 terminus of NA, although capable of providing the signal function in translocation across the rough endoplasmic reticulum, interferes with the transport of the chimeric HA to the cell surface.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the functional role of the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region of neuraminidase in protein translocation and transport, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Combined interferon-alpha 2, rimantadine hydrochloride, and ribavirin inhibition of influenza virus replication in vitro.
Abstract: Recombinant DNA-produced human interferon-alpha 2 inhibited the replication of influenza A and B viruses in primary rhesus monkey kidney cells (RMK). Human interferon-alpha 2 interacted additively or synergistically with rimantadine hydrochloride or ribavirin in reducing the yield of clinical isolates of either H3N2 or H1N1 subtype influenza A viruses. The combination of human interferon-alpha 2 and ribavirin also inhibited the replication of an influenza B virus to a greater extent than either single agent. In addition to drug concentration, the virus inoculum and duration of culture were important variables in determining the degree of inhibition. Single drugs or combinations did not significantly inhibit the growth of uninfected RMK cells, which indicated that the observed interactions with respect to antiviral activity were not due to cell cytotoxicity.
Relevant: False

Title: Glycosylation and surface expression of the influenza virus neuraminidase requires the N-terminal hydrophobic region.
Abstract: A full-length double-stranded DNA copy of an influenza A virus N2 neuraminidase (NA) gene was cloned into the late region of pSV2330, a hybrid expression vector that includes pBR322 plasmid DNA sequences and the simian virus 40 early region and simian virus 40 late region promoters, splice sequences, and transcription termination sites. The protein encoded by the cloned wild-type NA gene was shown to be present in the cytoplasm of fixed cells and at the surface of "live" or unfixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence with N2 monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from wild-type vector-infected cells with heterospecific N2 antibody showed that the product of the cloned NA DNA comigrated with glycosylated NA from influenza virus-infected cells, remained associated with internal membranes of cells fractionated into membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, and could form an immunoprecipitable dimer. NA enzymatic activity was detectable after simian virus 40 lysis of vector-infected cells. These properties of the product of the cloned wild-type gene were compared with those of the polypeptides produced by three deletion mutant NA DNAs that were also cloned into the late region of the pSV2330 vector. These mutants lacked 7 (dlk), 21 (dlI), or all 23 amino acids (dlZ) of the amino (N)-terminal variable hydrophobic region that anchors the mature wild-type NA tetrameric structure in the infected cell or influenza viral membrane. Comparison of the phenotypes of these mutants showed that this region in the NA molecule also includes sequences that control translocation of the nascent polypeptide into membrane organelles for glycosylation.

Title: Influenza virus hemagglutinin containing an altered hydrophobic carboxy terminus accumulates intracellularly.
Abstract: The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein synthesized from cloned DNA in a simian virus 40 vector is expressed on the surface of infected primate cells. Previously, it has been demonstrated that mutant HAs lacking the hydrophobic carboxy terminus fail to anchor on the cell surface and therefore are secreted extracellularly. During analysis of additional HA deletion mutants derived from an HA-simian virus 40 recombinant, we found a mutant with an altered hydrophobic carboxy terminus that exhibited another phenotype. This deletion mutant, dl-12, produced HA that was neither secreted nor expressed on the infected cell surface. The mutant HA was similar to the wild-type HA in apparent molecular weight and extent of glycosylation as assayed by endoglycosidase H sensitivity. The mutant HA localized near the perinuclear region of infected cells as indicated by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Sequence analysis showed that a 5-base-pair deletion had occurred before the region encoding the hydrophobic carboxy terminus. Nevertheless, the physicochemical properties of the wild-type HA carboxy terminus were maintained in that the truncated HA carboxy terminus consisted of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids followed by several charged amino acids residues. This similarity in the carboxy terminus between the wild-type and mutant HAs may be responsible for the functional similarities observed. In spite of these similarities, the mutant HA failed to mature at the surface. These results suggest that the maturation of the mutant HA is blocked during a late stage in the transit to the cell surface.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines intracellular accumulation of hemagglutinin with altered hydrophobic carboxy terminus, focusing on protein maturation and transport rather than explicit genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: The role of naturally-acquired bacterial infection in influenza-related death in neonatal ferrets.
Abstract: Concomitant, naturally-acquired bacterial infection was the cause of some deaths occurring in neonatal ferrets infected with the attenuated influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34, these being prevented by antibiotic therapy. Bacterial infection played an insignificant role in the greater number of deaths following inoculation with the virulent clone 7a (of the recombinant influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34-A/England/939/69/(H3N2]. As seen previously with clone 7a some ferret neonates infected with A/PR/8/34 died either from obstruction in the upper respiratory tract or from viral pneumonia, but with the latter virus, both types of lesion were probably attributable to the bacterial superinfection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the role of bacterial infection in influenza-related death in ferrets, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Modulation of glycosylation and transport of viral membrane glycoproteins by a sodium ionophore.
Abstract: Analysis of viral glycoprotein expression on surfaces of monensin-treated cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) demonstrated that the sodium ionophore completely inhibited the appearance of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein on (Madin-Darby canine kidney) MDCK cell surfaces. In contrast, the expression of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein on the surfaces of MDCK cells was observed to occur at high levels, and the time course of its appearance was not altered by the ionophore. Viral protein synthesis was not inhibited by monensin in either VSV- or influenza virus-infected cells. However, the electrophoretic mobilities of viral glycoproteins were altered, and analysis of pronase-derived glycopeptides by gel filtration indicated that the addition of sialic acid residues to the VSV G protein was impaired in monensin-treated cells. Reduced incorporation of fucose and galactose into influenza virus HA was observed in the presence of the ionophore, but the incompletely processed HA protein was cleaved, transported to the cell surface, and incorporated into budding virus particles. In contrast to the differential effects of monensin on VSV and influenza virus replication previously observed in monolayer cultures of MDCK cells, yields of both viruses were found to be significantly reduced by high concentrations of monensin in suspension cultures, indicating that cellular architecture may play a role in determining the sensitivity of virus replication to the drug. Nigericin, an ionophore that facilitates transport of potassium ions across membranes, blocked the replication of both influenza virus and VSV in MDCK cell monolayers, indicating that the ion specificity of ionophores influences their effect on the replication of enveloped viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines effects of a sodium ionophore on glycosylation and transport of viral glycoproteins, focusing on cellular processes rather than genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Lethal synergism induced in mice by influenza type A virus and type Ia group B streptococci.
Abstract: Intranasal inoculation of CD-1 or BALB/c mice with low doses of influenza A/PR8/34 (HON1) virus followed 48 h later by intranasal inoculation of low doses of type Ia group B streptococci effected a lethal synergism. At a constant input dose of virus, a direct relationship between input dose of bacteria and percent mortality was observed; the converse was also true. An inverse relationship between input dose of group B streptococci, but not input dose of virus, and mean time to death was observed in CD-1 but not in BALB/c mice. The kinetics of influenza A/PR8/34 virus and group B streptococcal replication in singly and dually infected BALB/c mice was determined by assaying samples from the lungs, liver, spleen, and blood for viable group B streptococci and infectious influenza A/PR8/34 virus. No significant difference in virus replication in the lung was observed between singly and dually infected mice. Extrapulmonary dissemination of virus was not observed. Concurrent virus infection effected a 10,000- to 100,000-fold increase in the levels of type Ia group B streptococci in the lung. Potentiation of group B streptococcal infection of the lung was not associated with bacteremia or infection of the liver or spleen, a finding contrary to previous observations of fulminant septicemia after intranasal inoculation of mice with input doses of group B streptococci less than one-tenth of the pulmonary levels observed in the present study.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates lethal synergism between influenza virus and bacterial infection in mice, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The sequence of RNA segment 1 of influenza virus A/NT/60/68 and its comparison with the corresponding segment of strains A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33.
Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA segment 1 of influenza virus A/NT/60/68, corresponding to the PB2 protein, has been determined. It is 2341 nucleotides long, encoding a predicted product of 759 amino acids with a net charge of +27 1/2 at neutral pH. The predicted amino acid sequence has been compared to the equivalent sequences in influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33. Evolutionary divergence, assuming a direct lineage from A/PR/8/34 and allowing for "laboratory drift", is 0.08% per year. The alignment of RNA segment 10 of A/NT/60/68 with segments 1 and 3 is completed, confirming that it is a mosaic of regions from these two segments.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on sequencing and comparing RNA segment 1 of influenza virus strains without linking specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Sequential mutations in the NS genes of influenza virus field strains.
Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequences of the NS genes from three human influenza viruses, A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/FW/1/50 (H1N1), and A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1), were determined. Only five single-base differences were found within the sequences of the A/FW/1/50 and A/USSR/90/77 NS genes, thus confirming earlier data suggesting that the 1977 H1N1 viruses are closely related to virus strains that were circulating around 1950. Comparison of all three sequences with those from A/PR/8/34 and A/Udorn/72 viruses illustrates that these genes (with the exception of that of the A/USSR/90/77 strain) evolve through cumulative base changes along a single common lineage. A nucleotide sequence variation of approximately 2.2 to 3.4% per 10 years was determined for the NS gene segments. Extensive size variation was also observed among the NS1 proteins of the various human viruses. The A/FM/1/47 NS1 protein, which consists of 202 amino acids, is 15% shorter than the A/Udorn/72 NS1 protein, which consists of 237 amino acids.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports nucleotide sequence variations and evolutionary relationships of NS genes but does not explicitly link these genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Generation of antibody diversity in the immune response of BALB/c mice to influenza virus hemagglutinin. I. Significant variation in repertoire expression between individual mice.
Abstract: The paratypic and idiotypic diversity of the BALB/c antibody response to the hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (PR8) was investigated using a panel of 125 anti-HA hybridoma antibodies derived from 14 BALB/c mice. The paratypic diversity, as assessed by a fine specificity analysis using 51 related influenza viruses, was extensive: 104 distinct paratopes were observed. In three instances, antibodies with indistinguishable paratopes were isolated from two individual mice. A minimum estimate of the size of the adult BALB/c anti-HA paratypic repertoire, calculated from these data, is 1,500. The generation of this diverse repertoire was studied by screening the anti-HA hybridoma panel for the presence of idiotypes (Id) that are markers for variable (V) region sequences derived from related germ line V genes. Three cross-reactive Id (IdX) that are markers for the V(k)21C, V(k)21B, and V(k)21A, D, E, or F L chain subgroups were found, respectively on 16, 1, and 10 anti-HA hybridoma antibodies derived from seven individual BALB/c mice. Thus, the V(k)21 IdX(+) hybridomas constitute 22 percent of the anti-HA hybridoma panel. The V(k)21 IdX are also present on 8.6 percent of K-bearing immunoglobulin in normal BALB/c serum. This suggests that the V(k)21 group is used preferentially in the BALB/c anti-HA immune response. The generation of the anti-HA repertoire was further studied using large panels of anti-HA hybridomas derived from two individual adult BALB/c mice. Anti-idiotypic antisera were raised in rabbits against individual hybridomas from each mouse. One anti-Id serum defined a family of four idiotypically and paratypically related, but not identical, antibodies from mouse 36, which represented 31 percent of the hybridoma antibodies isolated from this mouse. None of the 112 anti-HA hybridoma antibodies derived from 13 other individual mice showed idiotypic cross-reactivity. Furthermore, this Id could not be detected in anti-PR8 antisera from 75 individual BALB/c mice. Another anti-Id serum defined a family of 27 idiotypically related antibodies from mouse 37, which represented 50 percent of the hybridoma antibodies isolated from this mouse. Only 1 of the 71 hybridoma antibodies isolated from 13 other individuals was idiotypically cross-reactive. These results demonstrate that individual adult BALB/c mice express paratypically and idiotypically distinct antibody repertoires to the HA of influenza virus PR8. Based on these observations, we suggest that somatic mutation plays an important role in the generation of the adult anti-HA repertoire. Mechanisms that could account for differences in repertoire expression among individual mice are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates antibody diversity and immune repertoire variation in mice, focusing on immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: New opportunities for development of safe, effective live virus vaccines.
Abstract: Effective vaccines are not available for most viral diseases. This situation may soon change when the full force of contemporary molecular biology is applied to immunoprophylaxis. In certain viral diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, live attenuated vaccines are needed to confer effective protection. Until now the major obstacle to success has been genetic instability. It may be possible to construct stable, satisfactorily attenuated mutants by cloning viral DNA or RNA and then subjecting the cloned DNA to enzyme surgery to create viable deletion mutations. Modified cloned DNA derived from positive-strand viral RNA could then be transferred back into its virus by transfection of cells. Conversion of mutant cloned DNA into negative-strand RNA and transfer into its virus will require a more elaborate type of rescue.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing opportunities for vaccine development using molecular biology, without explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Complete nucleotide sequence of the polymerase 3 gene of human influenza virus A/WSN/33.
Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequence of polymerase 3 (P3) gene of a human influenza virus (A/WSN/33) has been determined using cDNA clones except for the last 11 nucleotides which were obtained by direct RNA sequencing. The WSN P3 gene contains 2,341 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 759 amino acids (molecular weight 85,800). The WSN P3 protein, as deduced from the plus-strand DNA sequence, is basic and enriched in positively charged amino acids. In addition, it contains clusters of basic amino acids which may provide sites for the interaction of P3 protein with the capped primer, template, and/or other polymerase proteins during the transcriptive and replicative processes of influenza viral RNA.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of a polymerase gene without linking sequence to phenotypic traits.

Title: Complete sequence analyses show that two defective interfering influenza viral RNAs contain a single internal deletion of a polymerase gene.
Abstract: Defective interfering (DI) influenza viral RNAs arise by internal deletion of progenitor RNAs. By using recombinant DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis techniques, we have deduced the complete sequence of two such RNAs (L2b and L3), both arising from the same polymerase (P1) gene of WSN influenza virus. We have also partially determined the sequence of the P1 polymerase gene, including the sequence at the point of deletion and the flanking regions. Our sequence study shows the following. (i) Both L2b and L3 arise by a simple deletion in the P1 gene. (ii) L2b and L3 are 683 and 441 nucleotides long, respectively. (iii) The first 413 and 244 nucleotides of the 5' ends of L2b and L3, respectively, are identical to those of the 5' end of the P1 gene. (iv) The last 270 nucleotides of L2b and 197 nucleotides of L3 are the same as those of the 3' end of the P1 gene. (v) The entire sequence of L3 is present in the sequence of L2b. (vi) Both the 5' and the 3' termini, including the transcription stop and poly(A) addition signals of the progenitor P1 gene, are present in both L2b and L3. (vii) The sequences at the deletion point and the flanking region of the P1 gene do not resemble the consensus splicing sequence of spliced mRNA suggesting that a replicational event rather than splicing is involved in the formation of influenza defective interfering RNAs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study sequences defective interfering RNAs but does not link these genotypes to phenotypic effects.

Title: The sequence of the nucleoprotein gene of human influenza A virus, strain A/NT/60/68.
Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A/NT/60/68 was established after using improved cloning methods to obtain full length cDNA clones in pBr322. The gene is 1565 residues long and codes for a basic protein of 498 amino acids. There are only 30 amino acid differences between it and the homologous sequence in A/PR/8/35, all occurring as point mutations. Assuming a common lineage, the evolutionary rate of divergence of the two strains is 0.18% amino acid per year. This confirms there is a slow but significant rate of evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports the nucleoprotein gene sequence and evolutionary rate without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Differential effect of monensin on enveloped viruses that form at distinct plasma membrane domains.
Abstract: We have observed a striking differential effect of the ionophore, monensin, on replication of influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells. In MDCK cells, influenza virus is assembled at the apical surfaces, whereas VSV particles bud from the basolateral membranes; no such polarity of maturation is exhibited in BHK21 cells. A 10(-6) M concentration of monensin reduces VSV yields in MDCK cells by greater than 90% as compared with controls, whereas influenza virus yields are unaffected. In BHK21 cells, monensin also inhibits VSV production, but influenza virus is also sensitive to the ionophore. Immunofluorescent staining of fixed and unfixed MDCK monolayers indicates that VSV glycoproteins are synthesized in the presence of monensin, but their appearance on the plasma membrane is blocked. Electron micrographs of VSV-infected MDCK cells treated with monensin show VSV particles aggregated within dilated cytoplasmic vesicles. Monensin-treated influenza virus-infected MDCK cells also contain dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, but virus particles were not found in these structures, and numerous influenza virions were observed budding at the cell surface. These results indicate that influenza virus glycoprotein transport is not blocked by monensin treatment, whereas there is a block in transport of VSV G protein. Thus it appears that at least two distinct pathways of transport of glycoproteins to the plasma membrane exist in MDCK cells, and only one of them is blocked by monensin.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the effect of monensin on virus replication related to cellular membrane domains, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Comparative inhibition of influenza and parainfluenza virus replication by ribavirin in MDCK cells.
Abstract: Actinomycin D inhibited the yield of influenza virus hemagglutinin from MDCK cells infected at high multiplicity, but had little effect on the yield of parainfluenza virus hemagglutinin. In similar hemagglutinin yield experiments, ribavirin was only slightly more active (threefold) against influenza virus than against parainfluenza virus replication. In plaque inhibition experiments, ribavirin depressed influenza virus plaque formation by 50% at a concentration of approximately 3 micrograms/ml, whereas the corresponding figure for parainfluenza viruses was threefold higher. The concentration of ribavirin demonstrating anti-influenza activity was indistinguishable for that inhibiting host cell growth. It is concluded that, unlike actinomycin D, ribavirin is unlikely to have a major effect on the provision of host cell 5-germinal methylated cap structures and the subsequent priming of influenza messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares drug inhibition effects on influenza and parainfluenza viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The role of season in the epidemiology of influenza.
Abstract: Four types of observations have been used to illustrate the seasonal characteristics of epidemic influenza: (1) The experience of a small population during 28 consecutive years, 1946-74, (2) world influenza outbreaks 1964-75 reported to the World Health Organization, (3) the experience of two widely separated localities at about the same latitude, 1969-74, and (4) the experience of two places at latitudes 30 degrees + on opposite sides of the Equator, 1968-74. The following tendencies are shown. (1) Outbreaks of influenza even in the small community came at approximately the same season almost every year. (2) Outbreaks are globally ubiquitous and epidemic loci move smoothly to and fro across the surface of the earth almost every year in a sinuous curve that runs parallel with the 'midsummer' curve of vertical solar radiation, but lags about six months behind it. Such findings exclude the mediation of seasonal control by any agencies of local distribution, and suggest a direct effect of variations in some component of solar radiation on virus or human host. (3) Antigenic variations in influenza A virus tended to have the same seasonal characteristics as epidemicity. This suggests that epidemicity and virus variation are two facets of one seasonally controlled process. None of these seasonal characteristics can be explained by the current concept of influenzal epidemiology. A new hypothesis recently proposed and recapitulated in the Appendix offers a possible explanation. The primary agency mediating seasonal control remains unidentified.

Title: Generation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro. II. Induction requirements with functionally inactivated virus preparations.
Abstract: Using noninfectious Sendai virus preparations after selective enzymatic digestion of either of the two viral envelope glycoproteins, it was possible to study the effect of different virion-cell membrane interactions on virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction in vitro. Three different virus preparations having capacity for virus-cell fusion, for virus-cell adsorption or lacking the ability to bind to cell membranes, were all active in the generation of virus-specific primary and secondary cytotoxic T cells, when added to the culture. Investigations on the responder cell requirements during CTL induction revealed that activation by addition of virions lacking the capacity to bind to cells was sensitive to the depletion of adherent cells. When virions with fusion and binding capacity were presented on tumor stimulator cells, different requirements with respect to adherent cells were obtained in the primary and secondary CTL response to Sendai virus. The data indicate that different viral antigen-cell membrane interactions govern the activation phase and effector phase of antigen-primed T cell populations, while sensitization of unprimed cells is dependent on the presence of adherent, perhaps antigen-presenting cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on induction of cytotoxic T cells by inactivated Sendai virus preparations, not influenza virus genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Polarity of influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus maturation in MDCK cells: lack of a requirement for glycosylation of viral glycoproteins.
Abstract: We have investigated whether glycosylation of membrane glycoproteins is a determinant of the site of maturation of enveloped viruses in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In MDCK cell monolayers, vesicular stomatitis virus buds exclusively from the basal or lateral plasma membranes and contains a sialylated glycoprotein, whereas influenza virus buds exclusively from the apical plasma membrane and lacks neuraminic acid. In order to study the possible relationship between glycosylation of viral glycoproteins and the budding site, infected MDCK cells were treated with tunicamycin at a concentration that completely inhibits glycosylation of viral glycoproteins and the site of virus maturation was examined by electron microscopy. When tunicamycin-treated monolayers were compared to controls, the polarity in the maturation sites of both viruses was maintained. These results indicate that glycosylation of viral glycoproteins is not required for the determination of the cellular maturation site of these enveloped viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of glycosylation in virus maturation polarity in MDCK cells, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Effect of influenza infection on the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of pulmonary macrophages.
Abstract: The effect of mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34 virus on pulmonary macrophage function was evaluated by using an in vitro system which allowed direct virus interaction with macrophages and then separate analysis of the steps required for bacterial clearance by macrophages. Infection of macrophages with this virus resulted in the appearance of a hemagglutinating activity on the macrophage surface; expression of this activity was inhibited by amantadine, 2-deoxyglucose, and cycloheximide and by pretreatment of the virus inoculum with ultraviolet light and specific antiserum. Since there was no release of extracellular virus, this growth cycle appeared to be incomplete (abortive). After influenza infection, net ingestion of viable Staphylococcus aureus by macrophage monolayers was unaltered and there was no change in the fraction of the monolayer which ingested cocci over a wide range of bacterial inputs. Influenza-infected macrophages also inactivated intracellular S. aureus at a rate indistinguishable from controls. Therefore, these in vitro studies do not support the hypothesis that the defect in pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms associated with influenza infections results from a direct effect of virus infection on either the phagocytic or bactericidal activity of resident pulmonary macrophages.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of influenza infection on macrophage function but does not link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Interaction of influenza A virus with human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Abstract: Peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen were exposed in vitro to influenza A virus. The synthesis of several virus-specific proteins, including the nucleoprotein, membrane protein, and nonstructural 1 protein were detected, although no infectious virus was produced by the lymphocyte cultures. Evidence was obtained that only a subpopulation of mitogen-transformed cells would support virus protein synthesis. A comparison of the interactions of influenza A virus with lymphocytes from normal individuals and from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed that the same range of virus-specific proteins were made, in similar quantities, regardless of the source of lymphocytes.

Title: Epidemic mechanisms of type A influenza.
Abstract: The antigenic varieties of influenza A virus isolated from 1968 to 1976 in a surveillance of a small, rather remote population were similar to those from England and Wales as a whole, despite frequent antigenic changes during the period. Household studies in the first two H3N2 influenza A epidemics found low attack rates within households, a high proportion (70%) of affected households with only one case of influenza, similar distributions of affected households in the two epidemics by the number of cases of influenza and similar distributions of the influenza cases by the day of their onset in the household outbreak. No serial interval could be demonstrated by cumulating household outbreaks. More than one minor variant was causing influenza contemporaneously in the same villages in several seasons, and different variants were on one occasion found on successive days in bedfellows. The regular occurrence of epidemics in winter was often accompanied by the disappearance of the epidemic variants and their replacement, after a virus-free interval, by new variants. These epidemiological findings seem best interpreted on the following tentative hypothesis. Influenza A sufferers do not transmit the virus during their illness; instead it rapidly becomes latent in their tissues so that they become symptomless carrier-hosts and develop specific immunity. Next season an extraneous seasonally mediated stimulus reactivates the latent virus residues so that the carrier-host becomes briefly infectious, though symptomless. Antigenic drift occurs because particles reconstituted to be identical with the progenitor virus cannot escape the specific immunity it has provoked in the carrier host. He can shed only mutants also determined by the progenitor virus. From the assortment of mutants shed by the carrier-host, his non-immune companions select that (those) which is best fitted to survive, and it rapidly causes influenzal illness. Epidemics consist largely or entirely of such persons sick with influenza caused by reactivated virus caught from symptomless carrier-hosts.

Title: Inhibition of influenza virus uncoating by rimantadine hydrochloride.
Abstract: In freeze-thaw lysates of MDCK cells infected with 32P-labeled influenza virus A/WSN in the presence of added RNase, acid-precipitable radioactivity diminished to about 50% of initial values within 90 min after a 1-h virus adsorption period. A similar preparation containing rimantadine at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml exhibited only a 10% reduction in acid-precipitable radioactivity. These findings suggest that rimantadine interferes with uncoating of influenza virus in infected cells.

Title: Host defense mechanisms against influenza virus: interaction of influenza virus with murine macrophages in vitro.
Abstract: The interaction of mouse macrophages with influenza virus was examined as part of a study into the defense mechanisms against influenza infection. Macrophages exposed to A/Port Chalmers/1/73 virus produced infectious foci on susceptible indicator cell monolayers. Sampling of supernatant fluids and cells from infected macrophage cultures showed release of virus adsorbed to the cell surface. Active virus replication in macrophages could not be demonstrated. Exposing macrophages to specific antibody before or after virus infection resulted in a significant decrease in the number of infectious macrophages. The results suggest that although macrophages are not the source of replicating influenza virus, they are able to spread the infection by having virus attaching to their surface. This activity is interfered with by the presence of specific antibody.
Relevant: False

Title: Vaccination for fowl plague.
Abstract: Influenza A/turkey/Oregon/71 virus has antigenic characteristics of fowl plague virus but is avirulent for chickens. The virus was inoculated intratracheally in chickens at several dosage levels and resulted in the formation of antibody and immunity against fowl plague. The avirulent virus replicated in chickens and was recoverable by tracheal swab specimens up to 4 days after inoculation. Although the virus was transmitted to contact controls at the time when their cagemates were inoculated, it was not transmitted to contact controls placed with chickens inoculated 24 hours earlier. After 10 passages in chickens, the virus remained avirulent for chickens and turkeys.

Title: Isolation and characterization of cytoplasmic inclusions from influenza A virus-infected cells.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses induce the accumulation of electron-dense inclusions in the cytoplasm of infected cells during the latter stages of the replication cycle. Cell fractionation studies showed that these inclusions could be recovered in subcellular fractions containing ribosomes and polysomes. Isolation of these inclusions was accomplished by procedures involving RNase treatment of these fractions followed by repurification, or by fluorocarbon extraction and gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy indicated that the isolated inclusions exhibited a major periodicity of approximately 8 nm with minor periodicities of approximately 4 nm. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the influenza virus coded nonstructural protein was the only protein component present in isolated inclusions.

Title: Synthesis of influenza virus polypeptides in cells resistant to alpha-amanitin: evidence for the involvement of cellular RNA polymerase II in virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza virus polypeptides were not synthesized in wild-type CHO-S-infected cells in the presence of alpha-amanitin, but were synthesized in CHO-Amal cells, a mutant cell line whose DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II is specifically resistant to this drug, indicating that this cellular enzyme is involved in influenza virus replication. The results of experiments designed to detect viral polypeptides synthesized from primary transcripts suggest that the synthesis of a cellular RNA species by RNA polymerase II is required for primary transcription of the influenza virus genome.

Title: Induction of virus-specific modifications recognized by cytotoxic T cells is not altered by prior substitution of target cells with trinitrophenol.
Abstract: Cytotoxic thymus-derived lymphocytes generated after interaction with trinitrophenyl (TNP)-substituted or virus-infected cells only lyse H-2 compatible target cells modified with the component used to immunize (TNP or virus). Prior saturation of TNP-reactive sites inhibits neither the infectivity of influenza A viruses, nor the capacity of infected cells to develop antigenic changes recognized by influenza-immune T cells. The two antigens are distinct entities on the cell membrane and do not obviously compete to form interactions with H-2 molecules.

Title: Suppression of cell-mediated immunity by street rabies virus.
Abstract: Mice lethally infected with street rabies virus failed to develop cytotoxic T cells specific for rabies virus-infected target cells, whereas high levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) were generated after nonfatal infection with the attenuated high egg passage (HEP) or ERA rabies virus strains. Furthermore concurrent infection with street, but not with HEP, rabies virus suppresses development of a primary (but not a secondary) CMC response specific for influenza virus. No cross-reactivity is found between effector T-cell populations from mice immunized with HEP or with influenza virus. It thus appears that street rabies virus, which is not known to replicate in the cells of immune system, induces some general defect in the primary CMC lymphocyte response, though restimulation of memory T-cell populations is unimpaired and there is no defect in antibody formation. Development of fatal rabies may reflect the operation of this selective immunosuppressive mechanism.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses immunosuppression by street rabies virus and its effects on cell-mediated immunity without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The effect of cyclic nucleotides on virus infection.
Abstract: The yield of influenza virus from infected primary chick kidney cells (PCKC) was enhanced by treatment with dcAMP. In addition, rapid serial passages of the virus in treated chick cells at low multiplicities did also exhibit maintenance of high virus titers. The action of dcAMP upon viral replication could be reproduced in the chick cells by treatment with various agents known to increase intracellular cAMP levels by differing mechanisms. Furthermore, an adrenergic component in the activation of the PCKC cAMP system is indicated by the effects of certain catecholamines on influenza virus yield. Dibutyryl cAMP was shown in the same host to inhibit multiplication of Herpesvirus hominis Type 2, and its effect on other cell-virus systems indicates that its action consists of some host-specific element(s).
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the effect of cyclic nucleotides on virus infection and host cell factors but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fluorosugars inhibit biological properties of different enveloped viruses.
Abstract: Both 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose were found to be potent inhibitors of the synthesis of infectious Semliki forest and fowl plague virus in chicken embryo cells and also of pseudorabies virus grown in rabbit kidney cells. It was found that the pseudorabies virus-mediated cell fusion and the synthesis of functional hemagglutinin of fowl plague virus were blocked. In all cases the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose-caused inhibition was stronger than the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose- or 2-deoxy-D-glucose-mediated blocks. Studies on the virus-specified proteins from Semiliki forest virus-infected cells grown in the presence of the inhibitors show that the target of the fluorosugar action, parallel to the well-studied effects of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, is the glycoprotein biosynthesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates the inhibitory effects of fluorosugars on viral protein synthesis but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Characterization of the mRNA of influenza virus.
Abstract: The kinetics of the appearance of influenza mRNA, the distribution of mRNA between free and membrane-associated polyribosomes, its poly(A) content, and the extent to which the genome was transcribed into mRNA early in infection were determined. Polyribosomes were prepared from influenza virus-infected cells labeled for 30-min periods at various times after infection with [3H]uridine. Most of the 3H-labeled RNA extracted from these polyribosomes sedimented as a heterogeneous 8S to 20S peak in sucrose gradients, and it was largely complementary to virion RNA. By the following criteria, the complementary RNA had properties normally ascribed to mRNA: (i) it labeled rapidly with [3H]uridine; (ii) after glutaraldelyde treatment, it banded with polyribosomes in CsCl density gradients; and (iii) it contained poly(A). In chick cells at 37 C, virus mRNA was first detectable at 45 min postinfection and reached its maximal rate of appearance at 2 to 2.5 h postinfection. The free and membrane-bound polyribosomes of infected cells were separated and were found to contain the same classes of mRNA. There was no absolute segregation of mRNA sequences into either polyribosome class although each probably contained distinct ratios of the different mRNA's. From 45 min postinfection onwards, both membrane-bound and free polysomal poly(A)-containing RNA contained sequences complementary to at least 80% of the genome RNA, whereas poly(A)-minus RNA contained sequences complementary to 90 to 100% of the genome. There was no evidence for the temporal control of transcription of influenza mRNA. At 31 C, when virus development was slowed relative to 37 C,complementary RNA first appeared at 1 h postinfection. At this time, total polysomal RNA contained sequences complementary to the whole genome.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes influenza virus mRNA kinetics and properties but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Abortive infection of L cells by influenza virus: absence of virion RNA synthesis.
Abstract: Influenza virus multiplies productively in chick cells and abortively in L cells. The infecting influenza virus RNA genomes are less stable in infected L cells than in infected chick cells. However, transcription of the virus genome in L cells, while reduced in rate, is not decreased in extent. There is no detectable synthesis of virion RNA in L cells, and this is the most likely cause of the abortive infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes abortive infection and lack of virion RNA synthesis in certain cells but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by simultaneous pretreatment of host cells with fowl plague virus and actinomycin D: a method for studying early protein synthesis of several RNA viruses.
Abstract: A method is described for analysis of viral protein synthesis early after infection when minute amounts of viral proteins are effectively concealed by large amounts of produced host-specific proteins. The method is superior to a radioimmune assay, since all virus-induced proteins can be measured independent of their immunological reactivity. Host-specific protein synthesis can be suppressed by infection with fowl plague virus. Addition of actinomycin C 1.25 h postinfection does not prevent this suppression, but it does block effectively the formation of fowl plague virus-specific proteins. Such cells synthesize only small amounts of cellular proteins, as revealed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis. They can be superinfected with several different enveloped viruses, however, without significant diminution of virus yeilds. In pretreated cells the eclipse is shortened for Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, but prolonged for Newcastle disease virus. The onset of protein synthesis, specific for the superinfecting virus, could be clearly demonstrated within 1 h after superinfection. At this time, in cells superinfected with Semliki Forest virus, great amounts of NSP 75 (nonstructural protein; molecular weight, 75 X 10(3)) and reduced amounts of the core protein C could be deomonstrated. The precursor glycoprotein NSP 68 is followed by a new polypeptide, NSP 65: three proteins with molecular weights exceeding 100 X 10(3) were observed which are missing later in the infectious cycle. Similar results were obtained after superinfection with Sindbis virus. The formation of a new polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 80 X 10(3) was detected. After superinfection with vesicular stomatis virus or Newcastle disease virus the formation of new proteins, characteristic for the early stage of infeciton, was not observed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a method to study early viral protein synthesis but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Failure of an influenza virus to initiate infection in enucleate BHK cells.
Abstract: Studies employing indirect immunofluorescent staining, acrylamide gel electrophoresis of [(35)S]methionine-labeled cellular polypeptides, and RNA-RNA hybridization of [(3)H]uridine-labeled cellular RNA, failed to detect evidence of fowl plague virus infection of BHK cells enucleated with cytochalasin B, although virus-specific polypeptide and RNA synthesis was detected in nucleate BHK cells. The enucleate cells permitted the synthesis of Newcastle disease and vaccinia virus structural proteins. We conclude that influenza virus fails to initiate macromolecular synthesis in enucleate BHK cells, and the role of the nucleus in influenza virus replication is discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies influenza virus infection in enucleate cells and the role of the nucleus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Virus replication in enucleate cells: vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus.
Abstract: The requirement of the presence of a nucleus for the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus has been examined by following the growth and development of these viruses in enucleate BS-C-1 cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus replicates normally in enucleate cells with the rate of production of infectious virus, the amount of virus-specific protein synthesis, and the type of proteins produced being essentially the same in nucleate and enucleate cells. Influenza virus does not replicate in enucleate cells, no virus gene products can be detected, and there is no inhibition of cellular protein synthesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper compares replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus in enucleate cells but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Formation of influenza virus proteins.
Abstract: Eight virus-specific proteins have been found in chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with fowl plague virus. Among them are two glycoproteins which are the constituents of the hemagglutinin on the virus particle. They are derived from a large precursor glycoprotein by cleavage of a covalent linkage. The reaction can be blocked by the protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate and the amino acid analogue fluorophenylalanine. This indicates that a peptide bond is cleaved. If infected cells are kept at 25 C, a temperature at which virus maturation is inhibited, the precursor glycoprotein is cleaved at a significantly slower rate than at 37 C. It appears, however, that a reduced synthesis of the carbohydrate-free envelope protein is responsible for the block of virus maturation at 25 C rather than the lower cleavage rate of the precursor.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes formation and processing of influenza virus proteins but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The differential effect of actinomycin D in normal and virus-transformed cells.
Abstract: Actinomycin D (AMD) at concentrations up to 0,25 microg/ml shows a differential effect on cell RNA synthesis and on the replication of an influenza virus in normal and virally transformed cells, both functions being more resistant to AMD in the transformed cell. A possible explanation for these differences in AMD sensitivity is provided by the observation that isotopically labeled AMD is maintained at a lower concentration in transformed BHK 21/13 (BHK) cells. There is evidence that the decreased sensitivity of the transformed cells to AMD is a result of maintenance of a lower internal concentration of the drug, since a correlation exists for a number of polyoma virus-transformed clones between sensitivity to and uptake of AMD.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies differential effects of actinomycin D on cell RNA synthesis and influenza virus replication in transformed cells but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of virus growth by ouabain: effect of ouabain on the growth of HVJ in chick embryo cells.
Abstract: The effect of ouabain (g-strophanthin), a cardiac glycoside, on the growth of several enveloped viruses was examined. It was found that the growth of HVJ (Sendai virus) in chick embryo cells was markedly inhibited by the drug at a concentration as low as 5 x 10(-5)m. A virus-inhibitory concentration of ouabain did not cause morphological changes in uninfected cells, nor did it have the capacity to inactivate virus infectivity. Ouabain interfered with the intracellular synthesis of viral macromolecules. Although viral ribonucleic acid and viral antigens were synthesized by the ouabain-treated cells, the rate of synthesis was slower, and the total amounts of these macromolecules were smaller than those in the untreated control cells. It is suggested that ouabain inhibits the function of membrane-bound Na, K-adenosine triphosphatase of the chick embryo cells and thus prevents accumulation of K ion in them. Accumulation of intracellular K ion to a certain level would be needed for events of exponential growth of virus to proceed, and ouabain might inhibit this step by preventing such accumulation of K ion. This view was supported by the finding that the concentration of K ion in the HVJ-infected cells was rapidly reduced by the treatment with ouabain, and that, when the ouabain-treated culture was shifted to a medium containing a higher concentration of K ion than normal medium, virus production started in parallel with the increase of intracellular K ion. The fact that the concentration of K ion in BHK-21 cells, which support virus growth in the presence of ouabain, is not reduced by the treatment with the drug also suggested this possibility.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper examines the effect of ouabain on virus growth and host cell ion concentrations but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Functional significance of sialidase during influenza virus multiplication: an electron microscope study.
Abstract: Morphological evidence has been obtained by electron microscopy in support of previous findings that one of the most important functions of sialidase is associated with the release of virus from infected host cells. Highly specific antiserum against fowl plague virus enzyme and specific antiserum against X7 recombinant influenza virus enzyme were shown to influence the morphology of cells infected with their homologous virus. In the presence of enzyme antiserum, an accumulation and aggregation of virus particles were evident on the cell surface and in the extracellular space of infected host cells. The aggregation of virus particles was interpreted to result from the inhibition of the release of virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the functional role of sialidase in virus release and morphology, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Effect of myxovirus infection on synthesis of cellular ribonucleic acid.
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis of chick embryo fibroblasts was inhibited by two members of the myxovirus group, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and fowl plague virus. It was also found that cellular deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent RNA polymerase was inhibited by a cytoplasmic factor induced by NDV infection.

Title: Deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase activity in cells infected with influenza virus.
Abstract: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase activity was assayed on nuclear preparations of chick embryo fibroblast cells at various times after infection with an influenza A virus (fowl plague virus) and was compared with the activity of uninfected cells. Polymerase activity was increased by about 60% by 2 hr after infection, and this increase coincided with an increase in RNA synthesis in infected cells, as determined by pulse-labeling with uridine. No difference could be detected between the polymerases of infected and uninfected cells as to their requirements for DNA primer, divalent cations, and nucleoside triphosphates, and they were equally sensitive to addition of actinomycin D to the reaction mixture. It is possible that host cell DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is involved in the replication of influenza virus RNA.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in infected cells, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The antiviral action of threo-beta-phenylserine.
Abstract: L-threo-phenylserine and esters of threo-phenylserine were the most active of a series of compounds tested against influenza A virus in tissue culture. Substitution of the beta-OH or alpha-NH(2) group abolished activity. The activity of phenylserine was reversed competitively by phenylalanine. Phenylserine did not act on free virus or on the adsorption of virus to host cells. It prevented virus growth if added during the first half of the latent period.Phenylalanine appears to be necessary for virus synthesis and can be supplied by phenylalanylglycine or glycylphenylalanine.Phenylserine had no significant activity against ectromelia infections in mice, even when the amino acid content of the livers had been depleted by starvation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the antiviral action of a compound against influenza virus, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Quantitative aspects of the multiplication of influenza A virus in the mouse lung; relation between the degree of viral multiplication and the extent of pneumonia.
Abstract: Influenza A virus, PR8 strain, increases in amount in the infected mouse lung at a relatively constant rate. When more than 25 M.S.50 doses of virus is inoculated, the rate of multiplication appears to be independent of the amount of virus introduced; has a value of 1,100-fold increase per day. The rate of increase in the pulmonary lesions induced by infection of the mouse lung with PR8 also appears to be relatively constant and independent of the amount of virus inoculated; has a value of 8.5-fold increase per day. The essential variables in the PR8-mouse lung system appear to be equated satisfactorily by functions which were derived previously (4) during a similar quantitative investigation on pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Evidence in support of the hypothesis that the processes of multiplication of PR8 and PVM are different in the mouse lung is presented.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper quantifies viral multiplication and pneumonia extent in mice but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mechanism of production of pulmonary lesions in mice by Newcastle disease virus (NDV).
Abstract: Infectious NDV particles produce extensive pulmonary consolidation in the mouse in the absence of demonstrable virus multiplication. The lesions are indistinguishable from those of influenza A virus infection. This effect of NDV was blocked by intranasal injection of RDE or immune serum before virus inoculation, but not by immune serum injected 5 minutes or more after NDV. Influenza A virus infection did not diminish fixation of NDV in excised lungs but did interfere with the injurious action of this agent in the living mouse. The analogy between these reactions and those which take place in a progressive virus infection is pointed out, and the mechanism of production of lesions in virus pneumonias discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines pulmonary lesions caused by NDV without demonstrable virus multiplication, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.
