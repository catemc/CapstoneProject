Title: Genetic Characterization and Evolutionary Insights of Novel H1N1 Swine Influenza Viruses Identified from Pigs in Shandong Province, China.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses exhibit broad host tropism, infecting multiple species including humans, avian species, and swine. Swine influenza virus (SIV), while primarily circulating in porcine populations, demonstrates zoonotic potential with sporadic human infections. In this investigation, we identified two H1N1 subtype swine influenza A virus strains designated A/swine/China/SD6591/2019(H1N1) (abbreviated SD6591) and A/swine/China/SD6592/2019(H1N1) (abbreviated SD6592) in Shandong Province, China. The GenBank accession numbers of the SD6591 viral gene segments are PV464931-PV464938, and the GenBank accession numbers corresponding to each of the eight SD6592 viral gene segments are PV464939-PV464946. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses suggest potential evolutionary differences between the isolates. SD6591 displayed a unique triple-reassortant genotype: comparative nucleotide homology assessments demonstrated that the PB2, PB1, NP, NA, HA, and NEP genes shared the highest similarity with classical swine-origin H1N1 viruses. In contrast, SD6592 maintained genomic conservation with previously characterized H1N1 swine strains, although neither of these two isolates exhibited significant intrasegmental recombination events. Through comprehensive sequence analysis of these H1N1 SIVs, this study provides preliminary insights into their evolutionary history and underscores the persistent risk of cross-species transmission at the human-swine interface. These findings establish an essential foundation for enhancing national SIV surveillance programs and informing evidence-based prevention strategies against emerging influenza threats.

Reason: The paper focuses on genetic characterization and evolutionary insights of novel H1N1 swine influenza viruses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Influenza A Virus H5N1 Subtype: Resurgent Interspecies and Intercontinental Transmission, and a New Host.
Abstract: It has been more than 25 years since the avian influenza A virus (IAV) H5N1 subtype emerged in humans in 1997. Since then, this virus has become endemic in poultry and wild birds and has been causing sporadic infections in humans. Furthermore, the H5N1 subtype has undergone numerous reassortment events with other avian IAVs, resulting in the emergence of various H5Nx subtypes. Furthermore, the original H5 hemagglutinin (HA) has evolved genetically and antigenically and diversified into multiple lineages, phylogenetic clades, and subclades. In 2020, clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 emerged in Europe and spread intercontinentally. Lately, H5N1 has exhibited a resurgence in transmission across the continents in different avian and mammalian species. Importantly, to the surprise of influenza virologists, H5N1 has recently been found to infect a new host, the cow, and has been detected in cow milk. Furthermore, spillover infections of H5N1 have also been detected in dairy farm workers. This review summarizes the recent transmission of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 across the globe and its pathogenesis and adaptation in different hosts. Also, this review discusses the susceptibility of the H5N1 subtype to anti-IAV drugs and vaccines and the public health response and measures that are undertaken and can be taken in the future to contain its further spread.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review summarizing transmission, pathogenesis, and adaptation but does not present explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Phylodynamic reconstruction of H1N1pdm09 influenza virus transmission in Brazil: a decade of evolutionary dynamics.
Abstract: The H1N1pdm09 influenza virus, which emerged in 2009 following a unique reassortment of swine-origin gene segments, rapidly replaced the seasonal H1N1 strain and triggered the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. In Brazil, the virus initially spread through intense community transmission before establishing a pattern of seasonal circulation. However, its long-term evolutionary dynamics in the country remain insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, we conducted a coordinated national genomic surveillance effort focused on the period from 2014 onward, when Brazil began systematic whole-genome sequencing of circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses. Through collaborative sequencing across all five Brazilian macroregions, we generated 597 complete genomes collected between 2014 and 2024. Using phylodynamic approaches, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal spread of H1N1pdm09, identified major circulating lineages, and integrated epidemiological data to assess patterns of persistence and regional transmission. Our findings reveal sustained circulation and multiple independent viral introductions over the past decade, with evidence of localized lineage maintenance, particularly in the Southeast and South regions. Phylogenetic analyses also indicate repeated seeding from international sources, underscoring the continued impact of global viral movement. In addition, genome-wide comparisons revealed reassortment events involving internal segments, which may have contributed to the persistence and adaptation of dominant lineages following the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents the most comprehensive reconstruction of H1N1pdm09 evolutionary dynamics in Brazil to date, highlighting the critical role of integrated, nationwide genomic surveillance in enhancing public health preparedness in tropical and subtropical regions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylodynamic reconstruction and evolutionary dynamics without explicit links between specific genotypes and phenotypic traits.

Title: Mutation rate variability in viral populations: Implications for lethal mutagenesis.
Abstract: Lethal mutagenesis is a strategy to achieve viral extinction by drugging viral mutation rates beyond an extinction threshold. Accurate estimation of the extinction threshold is critical, as elevating viral mutation rates near, but not past this threshold increases the likelihood of mutations that could result in drug resistance, vaccine escape, or increased pathogenesis. Traditional models of lethal mutagenesis rely on the Poisson distribution, which assumes a uniform mutation rate across individuals. Yet, RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) can have varied mutation rates due to mutations in the polymerase complex. This variability suggests that lethal mutagenesis models incorporating mutation rate diversity, such as ones using the gamma-Poisson distribution, may be more accurate for RNA viruses. Poisson models assume count data have equal mean and variance, while gamma-Poisson counts are overdispersed (variance greater than mean). Here, we provide experimental data showing that IAV mutations are overdispersed, indicating that the gamma-Poisson distribution is more appropriate for modeling IAV mutations. Modeling of lethal mutagenesis using the gamma-Poisson distribution reveals that the degree of overdispersion is critical in determining survival or extinction. Increased overdispersion shifts the extinction threshold higher, indicating that Poisson-based models have underestimated the mutation rate required to achieve viral extinction and avoid viral escape or accelerated evolution. Furthermore, time to extinction in simulated populations is significantly longer with gamma-Poisson-based models than Poisson-based. This investigation of how mutation rate variability affects lethal mutagenesis will directly impact antiviral drug design and strategy, thus advancing efforts to combat virus outbreaks and future pandemics.

Reason: The paper discusses mutation rate variability and modeling implications for lethal mutagenesis but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype C2.1) in commercial ring-necked pheasants during the 2022 outbreak in the United States.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was introduced into North America in 2021. In 2022, clade 2.3.4.4b spilled into domestic poultry in the United States (U.S.), resulting in the largest HPAI outbreak in U.S. history. In December 2023, H5N1 2.3.4.4b was detected on an upland game bird farm in Pennsylvania. History, clinical signs, and gross lesions were suggestive of marble spleen disease. However, HPAI was identified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; gene sequencing confirmed genotype C2.1 with phylodynamic analyses providing evidence of a wild bird introduction. Predictive mathematical modeling estimated the time of virus introduction onto the farm (15 days (95% C.I., 11-23) before the date of confirmed detection) being similar or longer than previously described for domestic poultry. Although bioexclusion measures were unable to prevent the initial exposure due to industry rearing practices, biocontainment procedures appeared to prevent spread. The lessons learned from this case may be important for other animal agriculture commodities, especially those species that are infrequently handled or observed and may have inaccurately calculated mortality levels. This well-characterized outbreak and other experiences with natural infection should be taken as opportunities to better understand the field dynamics of this virus.

Title: A taxonomically harmonized global dataset of wild bird hosts for avian influenza virus surveillance.
Abstract: Wild birds are key natural reservoirs and play a central role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the absence of a standardized global list of wild bird hosts has limited comprehensive AIV risk monitoring and assessment within the One Health framework. Here, we generate a taxonomically harmonized dataset of AIV wild bird hosts, derived from 23,358 viral isolates of wild bird origin reported in the GISAID EpiFlu<sup>TM</sup> database from 1973 to 2023. Host names were systematically extracted, validated, and harmonized to resolve reporting inconsistencies and unify taxonomy across records. The dataset comprises 394 wild bird species spanning 26 orders, with Anseriformes and Charadriiformes representing a substantial share of host diversity. By clarifying the global spectrum of wild bird hosts for AIVs, this dataset provides a foundation for host identification, phylogenetic annotation, and ecological trait-based analysis. Structured in machine-readable formats, it enables reproducible and large-scale, species-level studies spanning virology, epidemiology, and biodiversity.
Relevant: False

Title: Timely vaccine strain selection and genomic surveillance improve evolutionary forecast accuracy of seasonal influenza A/H3N2.
Abstract: Evolutionary forecasting models inform seasonal influenza vaccine design by predicting which current genetic variants will dominate in the influenza season 12 months later. Forecasting models depend on hemagglutinin sequences from global public health networks to identify current genetic variants (clades) and estimate clade fitnesses. The lag between collection of a clinical sample and public availability of its sequence averages ∼3 months, complicating the 12-month forecasting problem by reducing our understanding of current clade frequencies. Despite continued methodological improvements to forecasting models, these constraints of a 12-month forecast horizon and 3-month submission lags impose an upper bound on any model's accuracy. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed that modern vaccine technology reduces forecast horizons to 6 months and expanded sequencing support reduces submission lags to 1 month on average. We quantified the potential effects of these public health policy changes on forecast accuracy for A/H3N2 populations. Reducing forecast horizons to 6 months reduced average absolute forecasting errors to 25% of the 12-month average, while reducing submission lags decreased uncertainty in current clade frequencies by 50%. These results show the potential to improve the accuracy of existing forecasting models through realistic changes to public health policy.

Title: Zoonotic Implications of the Co-Circulation of Clade 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.2.1a H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses in Nepal in 2023.
Abstract: Samples collected from two avian influenza outbreaks in Bagmati Province in central Nepal between January and March 2023 were positive for H5N1. Full genomes were generated for both viruses, which revealed that one of the viruses was very similar to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 identified in Bangladesh in 2021/2022. The second virus was a reassortant H5N1 virus consisting of four genes (HA, NA, NP, and M) originating from a clade 2.3.2.1a H5N1 and the remaining four genes (NS, PB1, PB2, and PA) originating from a 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Notably, this second virus had a high identity with 2.3.2.1a clade viruses identified in humans and cats in India in 2024-2025. These are the first full genome sequences of H5N1 avian influenza viruses from Nepal and given the recent human infections by 2.3.2.1a H5N1 viruses in the region, these data will be of interest to both public health and veterinary authorities.

Title: Computational Discovery of Potent Nucleoprotein Inhibitors for Influenza A Virus: Validation Through QM/MM Analysis and Experimental Binding Assays.
Abstract: This study employed an integrated computational approach to discover novel nucleoprotein (NP) inhibitors for influenza A virus (IAV). Beginning with virtual screening of over 10 million compounds using Schrödinger's Glide module (HTVS, SP, XP docking), the workflow identified promising candidates with favorable binding energies. Subsequent molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations and 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations prioritized 16 compounds for experimental validation. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays revealed that compounds <b>8</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> demonstrated superior target engagement, showing equilibrium dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>) of 7.85 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 3.82 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M, and 6.97 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M, respectively. Molecular dynamics, alanine scanning mutagenesis, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) analysis were conducted to analyze the binding modes, providing a reference for the design of subsequent compounds. These findings validate the efficacy of structure-based virtual screening in identifying high-affinity NP inhibitors and provide insights for the development of broad-spectrum anti-influenza therapeutics.

Title: Molecular Detection and Genetic Characterization of H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Laying Hen and Broiler Farms in Dakar and Thiès Regions, Senegal.
Abstract: Avian influenza, particularly the low pathogenic H9N2 subtype, is a major challenge to poultry and public health in Senegal. As important as it is, little is known about the occurrence and genetic characteristics of the H9N2 detected within the country's poultry farms. This study was therefore carried out to assess the occurrence and the molecular characteristics of H9N2 avian influenza virus strains in broiler and layer farms of the Dakar and Thiès regions. Throughout a period of 16 months, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken, collecting 390 tracheal and cloacal swabs from 39 chicken farms that reported respiratory disease. Viral RNA was isolated and analysed using real-time RT-PCR followed by viral isolation and hemagglutinin gene sequencing on positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine genetic associations with regional strains. Overall, the prevalence was 9.2% across 87 pools made from 390 swabs, with broiler chickens showing a high prevalence of 19.4% and layer hens a low prevalence of 2.0%. The majority of the positive farms were located in the Thiès region, which accounted for 6 out of the 8 positive farms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating strain belonged to the G1 lineage and was closely related to Moroccan strains, indicating likely regional spread through poultry trade. The strains did not possess any molecular markers of increased virulence or zoonotic potential. These findings confirm the endemicity of H9N2 in Senegal's important poultry-producing regions and raise the need for targeted surveillance and improved biosecurity to avoid outbreaks and preserve public health.

Title: Echoes in the Deep: Revealing Influenza A Viruses' Persistence and Microbial Associations in Aquatic Ecosystems.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are significant pathogens with complex transmission dynamics in aquatic ecosystems, yet their persistence, evolutionary relationships, and associations with environmental microorganisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic characteristics and ecological associations of IAV in freshwater and seawater ecosystems in Eastern China to inform public health strategies. Water samples were collected from three freshwater lakes and a coastal seawater site. Viral particles were concentrated, and nucleic acids were extracted for metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses, population dynamics assessments, and microbial association networks were constructed using bioinformatic tools. Statistical tests, including Tajima's <i>D</i> and Fu and Li's tests, were applied to evaluate evolutionary trends. IAV fragments in seawater showed high homology with recent human H3N2 strains from North America (2021-2024), while freshwater-derived fragments aligned with historical avian strains from Asia. Microbial association networks revealed significant associations between IAV and environmental bacteria (e.g., <i>Brevundimonas aurantiaca</i>) and fungi (e.g., <i>Thamnidium</i>), implying potential ecological associations that may underpin viral persistence. Freshwater environments with higher abundances of Uroviricota exhibited more frequent IAV detection. PERMANOVA confirmed distinct overall microbial community compositions in IAV-positive versus IAV-negative samples across both freshwater and seawater ecosystems (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Aquatic ecosystems, particularly freshwater habitats, may serve as reservoirs for IAV persistence and evolution, driven by complex microbial associations. Regional disparities in viral strain origins highlight the role of migratory waterfowl and environmental transmission routes. Integrated surveillance of aquatic IAV dynamics is critical to anticipate zoonotic risks and mitigate future outbreaks.

Title: Circumpolar spread of avian influenza H5N1 to southern Indian Ocean islands.
Abstract: Since 2020, the outbreak of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b has turned into the largest documented panzootic <sup>1,3</sup>. Here, we describe its arrival into the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic archipelagos of Crozet and Kerguelen, where we first detected the virus in October 2024 in dead southern elephant seals. While the panzootic is ongoing, it has already caused unprecedented mortalities of marine mammals and seabirds. We collected brain swabs from seal and seabird carcasses and obtained 25 novel HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b sequences. Using phylogeographic analyses, we show that there have been independent introductions of the virus to Crozet and Kerguelen islands, most likely from the distant South Georgia islands in the Southern Atlantic, and not from the more nearby coasts of South Africa. Our results point to a year-long gap in genomic surveillance in the sub-Antarctic region. Locally, our analyses show that the virus is transmitted between different species. Our serological analyses show that some southern elephant seal had mounted an anti-H5 antibody response. Through its circumpolar spread to the Indian Ocean, HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b moves closer to Australia, which remains free from infections with this strain, and represents a major threat to the sub-Antarctic wildlife.

Title: Genetic Diversity of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated in Hokkaido, Japan, During Winter 2024-2025.
Abstract: Genetic and antigenic analyses were performed on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated in Hokkaido, northern Japan, during the winter of 2024-2025. Ninety-eight HPAIVs were isolated from feces of waterfowl, tracheal swabs from dead wild birds, or lung homogenates from dead chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from 47 representative isolates revealed that all sequences belonged to the G2d subgroup of clade 2.3.4.4b H5HA, which has been the dominant lineage in Hokkaido since the winter of 2021-2022. These isolates were further divided into three major groups within the subgroup. The HPAIVs isolated in the Republic of Korea, China, and North America were genetically closely related to the Hokkaido isolates, whereas no HPAIVs genetically related to European strains or those detected in North American cattle were identified. Furthermore, HPAIVs isolated from seabirds were genetically closely related to those found in dead marine mammals along the eastern coast of Hokkaido in the spring of 2025. No apparent antigenic differences were observed between the HPAIVs isolated in this study and those from previous seasons. These findings highlight the wide distribution of HPAIVs in Hokkaido, particularly from Asian and North American lineages, and underscore the importance of continuous surveillance.

Title: H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b: Evolution, Global Spread, and Host Range Expansion.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the H5 subtype pose a continuous threat to animal and public health due to their zoonotic potential, rapid evolution, and ability to spread across continents. Since the emergence of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (GsGD) H5 lineage in 1996, several clades have caused devastating outbreaks in poultry and wild bird populations, occasionally resulting in human infections. Of the many clades that have evolved, only three-clades 2.2, 2.3.2.1, and most recently 2.3.4.4b-have demonstrated the ability to spread globally. The 2.3.4.4b clade has raised significant concern due to its continuous geographic expansion, establishment in new ecosystems, including Antarctica, and increasing reports of mammalian infections, including companion animals, marine mammals, and livestock. Recently, cow-to-cow and cow-to-human transmission marked a paradigm shift in the epidemiology of avian influenza and emphasized the need for continued surveillance. This review summarizes the historical emergence, global spread, and molecular evolution of H5 HPAIVs with a specific focus on the recent expansion of clade 2.3.4.4b and its capacity for mammalian spillover.

Title: Isolation and identification of the H9N2 virus that caused the decline in poultry egg production in Indonesia from 2011 to 2018 using the RT-PCR-sequencing method.
Abstract: Influenza A virus subtype H9 is enzootic in portions of North and Central Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, where it significantly reduces the chicken industry's profitability. The H9N2 virus was reported in Indonesia in late 2016, causing decreased egg production and increased mortality. Research on the H9N2 virus is important as an early warning system for the reassortment of potentially pandemic viruses such as HPAI virus subtype H5N1. This tracking study aimed to isolate and identify the H9N2 virus in laying hens from samples collected from 2011 to 2018 in Indonesia. Sequencing was performed on 2,949 samples obtained from tracheal and cloacal swabs after examination for the H9N2 virus using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. One positive sample was from West Java in 2017. The results of the phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus belongs to the China-Vietnam-Indonesia lineage and is related to the A/chicken/West Java/VSN791/2017(H9N2) and A/chicken/Viet Nam/QN-2576/2015(H9N2) viruses. As an early warning system for AI outbreaks, active surveillance is required to track the progress of LPAI viruses like H9N2.

Title: Swine influenza-modified pulmonary microbiota.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a major health concern in both humans and animals, with pigs serving as key reservoirs for generating novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential. Respiratory microbiome alterations during infection may facilitate secondary bacterial complications. This study investigates the lung microbiota of pigs naturally infected with IAV across different regions in Spain, using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize associated bacterial communities. Our results show a higher bacterial genus diversity in IAV-infected animals compared to healthy controls, with significant differences in both presence and relative abundance of bacterial taxa. Infected lungs exhibited increased proportions of potential pathogens, particularly <i>Glaesserella</i> spp., detected in approximately 60% of infected samples, often as the dominant genus. Other pathogenic genera, including <i>Pasteurella</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Mycoplasma</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium</i>, were also strongly associated with infection. Clustering analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles that clearly separated infected from non-infected animals, identifying specific bacterial signatures predictive of infection status. These findings suggest that IAV infection significantly alters the pulmonary microbiota, potentially creating a permissive environment for secondary bacterial infections. This study underscores the relevance of microbiota shifts during IAV infection in swine and highlights the importance of understanding microbial dynamics in respiratory disease progression. Additionally, we present a novel, rapid, and practical experimental pipeline based on ONT long-read sequencing to investigate the respiratory microbiota in swine infection models. This approach offers a valuable tool for future research and potential diagnostic applications in both veterinary and human medicine.

Title: Intensive reassortment and frequent intercontinental transmission revealed by long-term genetic analysis of H10 avian influenza viruses in Taiwan.
Abstract: H10 subtype avian influenza viruses primarily circulate among wild waterfowl but can occasionally infect mammals, including humans, and recent sporadic human cases have raised significant public health concerns. In this study, we sequenced and analysed 59 H10 subtype viruses isolated from wild birds in Taiwan. Results showed that all isolates were genetically distinct from human and other mammalian H10 subtype isolates. Taiwanese isolates exhibited high genetic diversity and could be categorized into 34 distinct genotypes, with each genotype circulating only in a single migratory season and not recurring during subsequent seasons. Additional analyses revealed that certain gene pools frequently circulate in the Pacific Rim, with evidence of North American lineage genes establishing long-term populations in Eurasia and vice versa. Although no characteristics indicative of mammalian adaptation was found in the Taiwanese isolates, temporal changes in the haemagglutinin cleavage site sequences were observed. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary dynamics of H10 avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds in Taiwan, emphasizing the complexity of intercontinental gene flow and viral reassortment. Currently, no consistent molecular markers indicating the impact of H10 avian influenza viruses on mammals or poultry have been identified. Notably, the observed changes in the haemagglutinin cleavage site sequences among Eurasian viruses suggest potential antigenic variations, indicating a need for further investigation into these changes. This potential highlights the necessity of ongoing surveillance to track the evolution and transmission dynamics of these viruses.

Title: Detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus in a sheep in Great Britain, 2025.
Abstract: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) continues to pose a significant global threat, affecting wild and domestic avian, and mammalian species. In early 2024, H5N1 HPAIV was detected in dairy cattle in the United States of America, where it has continued to circulate, with sporadic detections also reported in other ruminant species. The detection of high viral loads in milk from infected cattle, resulted in several human infections, underscoring the zoonotic potential of these viruses. In response, several countries have intensified surveillance in non-avian species to evaluate the potential for undetected viral circulation in captive mammals. In Great Britain, bulk milk tank testing of cattle and targeted surveillance of captive mammalian species on an infected premises is undertaken in accordance with the outcome of a rapid risk assessment. This assessment is undertaken to determine epidemiological links between the poultry and captive mammals. A result of this testing was the first recorded detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in a sheep in March 2025, identified on an infected poultry premises housing ducks, chickens, turkeys and geese in Great Britain. An initial seropositive result in a single ewe triggered further investigation, confirming serological positivity across repeated sampling and the presence of viral RNA in milk samples. This detection was confined to a single animal and is likely attributable to proximity to infected poultry and a presumed heavily contaminated environment. The implications of this detection in a ruminant host are discussed in the context of interspecies transmission and surveillance strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection of H5N1 in a sheep and discusses epidemiological implications but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic data and meteorological conditions suggesting windborne transmission of H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza between commercial poultry outbreaks.
Abstract: Understanding the transmission routes of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) is crucial for developing effective control measures to prevent its spread. In this context, windborne transmission, the idea that the virus could travel through the air over considerable distances, is a contentious concept, and documented cases have been rare. Here, though, we provide genetic evidence supporting the feasibility of windborne transmission. During the 2023-24 HPAI season, molecular surveillance identified identical H5N1 strains among a cluster of unrelated commercial farms about 8 km apart in the Czech Republic. The episode started with the abrupt mortality of fattening ducks on one farm. This was followed by disease outbreaks at two nearby high-biosecurity chicken farms. Using genetic, epizootiological, meteorological and geographical data, we reconstructed a mosaic of events strongly suggesting wind was the most probable mechanism of infection transmission between poultry in at least two independent cases. By aligning the genetic and meteorological data with critical outbreak events, we determined the most likely time window during which the transmission occurred and inferred the sequence of infected houses at the recipient sites. Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation. Furthermore, our results also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites. These findings underscore the importance of considering windborne spread in future outbreak mitigation strategies.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Bearded Vultures in Spain.
Abstract: We report mortality in bearded vultures ( Gypaetus barbatus ) associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI A H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, responsible for the current HPAI panzootic. Between April and May 2022, a total of five bearded vultures from Spain, four free-ranging and one captive individual, were found dead in their nest or with acute symptoms of disease. Complete necropsies were performed and histopathological, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses were carried out. The presence of the HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed in different organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feathers from the affected individuals. The complete viral genome was obtained from three of the affected bearded vultures. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the sequences obtained from the free-ranging individuals and the captive specimen belonged to the clade 2.3.4.4b and clustered separately. Furthermore, it supports that direct or indirect contact with other sympatric wild birds could be the most likely source of infection. This research highlights the susceptibility of the endangered bearded vulture to HPAI H5N1, thereby contributing to the broader understanding of the virus's host range.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection and phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 in vultures but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: A bacteria-based search for drugs against avian and swine flu yields a potent and resistance-resilient channel blocker.
Abstract: Influenza represents a significant threat with seasonal epidemics that can transition to global pandemics, and cross-species infection presenting a continuous challenge. While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus's validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure-activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus's channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo's potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.

Title: Nanchangmycin suppresses influenza A virus infection by blocking endosomal acidification.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) constitute a major threat to human and animal health. Currently, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors have been applied clinically as therapeutics against IAVs. However, IAVs possess adaptive mutations to these inhibitors, especially M2 ion channel and NA inhibitors. Thus, novel antiviral agents should be developed. In the present study, we screen approximately 5500 compounds and identify an IAV inhibitor, nanchangmycin, which possesses a robust antiviral activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, it exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity for additional virus infections, including pseudorabies virus, herpes virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Most importantly, it has antiviral activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains in sub-μM ranges and promotes the survival of MDCK cells infected with the oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus strain. Further studies reveal that it blocks the nuclei migration of viral nuclear proteins (NPs), resulting in NP accumulation in the cytoplasm, particularly within perinuclear endosomes. Also, it inhibits IAVs by blocking endosomal acidification. Overall, nanchangmycin has the potential to be developed as an anti-influenza agent.

Reason: The paper describes the antiviral activity of nanchangmycin and its mechanism of action but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of a Novel Gull-like Clade of Newcastle Disease Virus and H3N8 Avian Influenza Virus in the Arctic Region of Russia (Taimyr Peninsula).
Abstract: Wild waterbirds are circulating important RNA viruses, such as avian coronaviruses, avian astroviruses, avian influenza viruses, and avian paramyxoviruses. Waterbird migration routes cover vast territories both within and between continents. The breeding grounds of many species are in the Arctic, but research into this region is rare. This study reports the first Newcastle disease virus (NDV) detection in Arctic Russia. As a result of a five-year study (from 2019 to 2023) of avian paramyxoviruses and avian influenza viruses in wild waterbirds of the Taimyr Peninsula, whole-genome sequences of NDV and H3N8 were obtained. The resulting influenza virus isolate was phylogenetically related to viruses that circulated between 2021 and 2023 in Eurasia, Siberia, and Asia. All NDV sequences were obtained from the Herring gull, and other gull sequences formed a separate gull-like clade in the sub-genotype I.1.2.1, Class II. This may indirectly indicate that different NDV variants adapt to more host species than is commonly believed. Further surveillance of other gull species may help to test the hypothesis of putative gull-specific NDV lineage and better understand their role in the evolution and global spread of NDV.

Title: Phylogeographic Analysis of Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in Serbia Reveals Repeated Introductions and Spread Across the Balkans.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 continues to pose a major threat to animal and public health. Since its emergence, clade 2.3.4.4b has become the dominant global lineage, associated with widespread outbreaks in Europe. This study aimed to characterise the H5N1 strains detected in backyard chickens in Serbia and investigate their phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships with historical and currently circulating strains in Serbia and the broader region. Samples collected in 2024 were tested by qRT-PCR, and positive samples were propagated in MDCK cells. Whole genome sequencing of isolated virus was performed using the MinION Mk1C platform (ONT, Oxford, UK). Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were conducted using BEAST X and SPREAD3 v.9.6. The results revealed three independent introductions of H5N1 into Serbia between 2020 and 2024. The spatiotemporal diffusion patterns confirmed both north-south and west-east viral spread from Northern and Central Europe into the Balkans. Additionally, Serbia was identified as a critical transit and divergence point in the regional transmission network, highlighting its role in the spread of H5N1 between Western and Eastern Europe. These findings underscore the importance of continued genomic surveillance in both domestic and wild bird populations to better understand and reduce HPAI spread.

Title: Applying Field and Genomic Epidemiology Methods to Investigate Transmission Networks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in Domestic Poultry in British Columbia, Canada (2022-2023).
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A (H5N1) was first detected in North America in 2021. Ongoing spillover events from wild to domestic birds and subsequent transmission between domestic birds resulted in Canada's largest recorded epidemic of HPAI. Between December 2021 and April 2024, 422 A (H5N1) outbreaks in domestic birds were confirmed in Canada. Of these, 158 (37%) occurred in British Columbia (BC). This study integrates field and genomic epidemiology (GE) results to investigate the potential for lateral or local spread between infected poultry farms in BC. Five genetically distinct viral clusters were identified during this period. Among the 31 noncommercial premises, 27 (87.1%) were classified as independent introductions, while four premises (12.9%) were attributed to local spread within 10 km of a phylogenetically connected infected premises (IP). No lateral spread events were identified among noncommercial premises. All infected noncommercial premises housed birds with outdoor access, emphasizing their susceptibility to wild bird exposure. Of the 127 infected commercial poultry premises, 21 (16.5%) were classified as independent introductions, 82 (64.6%) as local spread, 18 (14.2%) with potential for lateral spread, five (3.9%) with potential for both local and/or lateral spread, and one (0.8%) for which sequencing was unavailable. Local spread emerged as a prominent feature, with most IP in proximity to one another having genetically similar viruses. Results suggest that proximity (<200 m) to an IP was a more reliable predictor of future infection status than contact with an IP. These findings underscore the critical value of combining field and GE to understand outbreak dynamics comprehensively. This integrative approach improves resource allocation, informs targeted containment strategies, and supports the need for effective biosecurity measures to mitigate future risks, particularly in densely populated poultry production regions. Robust interventions are needed to address both independent introductions and secondary spread pathways.

Title: Multidisciplinary Tracking of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak in Griffon Vultures, Southern Europe, 2022.
Abstract: Since 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus has affected wild bird populations globally. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), a species hitherto considered unexposed, experienced an HPAI H5N1 outbreak in 2022 in southern Europe, leading to moderate mortality and reduced breeding success. The integration of virological, serologic, phylogenetic, and ecologic data revealed a short yet intense viral circulation and a probable common source of infection. The dissemination across Spain and France was likely caused by frequent interpopulation movements of birds. This integrated overview of the 2022 HPAI outbreak in vultures provides novel insights into the role of large-scale movements of wild birds in the spread of such disease. Understanding the epidemiologic dynamics of HPAI H5N1 in these scavenger species is crucial because the birds play vital roles in ecosystem functioning. Their susceptibility to this virus highlights potential broader ecologic effects of the ongoing outbreaks.

Title: Transmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) Viruses in Wild Birds, South Korea, 2023-2024.
Abstract: We analyzed 15 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus infections detected in wild birds in South Korea during September 2023-March 2024. We isolated and sequenced 8 H5N1 and 7 H5N6 viruses. We investigated spatiotemporal transmission dynamics by using a Bayesian discrete trait phylodynamic model that incorporated geographic and host species information. Our source-sink dynamics support introductions of H5N1 viruses from northern Japan to South Korea and subsequent spread through multiple regions in South Korea. The H5N6 viruses were most likely introduced into southwestern South Korea and spread northeastward. Wild waterfowl, especially wild ducks, played a key role in transmission of both H5N1 and H5N6 viruses. Our data showed multiple introductions and extensive spread of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b viruses and bidirectional transmission between Japan and South Korea. Our results highlight the value of enhanced active surveillance for monitoring HPAI viruses, which can provide insight into preventing future outbreaks.

Title: Proximity labelling of internalizing influenza A viruses reveals a role for neogenin in virus uptake.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen of global concern. Entry of most IAVs is mediated by binding of viral hemagglutinin to cellular sialic acid, facilitating virus attachment. A subsequent interaction with a surface receptor(s) triggers viral uptake. Although multiple host factors involved in viral entry are known, the identity of these receptors remains unclear. Here, we utilized proximity labelling to acquire the interactome of epsin 1, an adaptor protein utilized by IAV for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, during virus internalization to identify them. We uncover neogenin (Neo1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed in primary human airway cultures, as a potential epsin 1 interactor and virus receptor candidate. Knockdown of Neo1 led to a reduction in replication of H1N1, H2N2 and H5N1 IAVs in primary and immortalized lung cells. Moreover, human recombinant Neo1 was found to bind IAV with a KD of 21 ± 14 nM by atomic force microscopy and Neo1 could co-localize with incoming IAV at early times post-infection, as well as affect viral entry. As Neo1 can interact with IAV and its depletion impairs IAV entry, this study reveals its potential as an IAV internalization receptor.

Title: Efficacy of baloxavir marboxil against bovine H5N1 virus in mice.
Abstract: Since the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) in U.S. dairy cattle in early 2024, the virus has spread rapidly, posing a major public health concern as the number of human cases continues to rise. Although human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed, experimental data suggest that the bovine H5N1 virus can transmit via respiratory droplets in ferrets, highlighting its pandemic potential. With no vaccines currently available, antiviral drugs remain the only treatment option. Here, we investigate the efficacy of the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (BXM) against this virus in mice. We find that early treatment post-infection is effective, but delayed treatment significantly reduces BXM efficacy and increases the risk of BXM resistance, underscoring the importance of timely BXM administration for effective treatment.

Title: Amplicon sequencing of pasteurized retail dairy enables genomic surveillance of H5N1 avian influenza virus in United States cattle.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses with H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (clade 2.3.4.4b) are causing an ongoing panzootic in wild birds. Circulation of these viruses is associated with spillover infections in multiple species of mammals, including a large, unprecedented outbreak in American dairy cattle. Before widespread on-farm testing, there was an unmet need for genomic surveillance. Infected cattle can shed high amounts of HPAI H5N1 viruses in milk, allowing detection in pasteurized retail dairy samples. Over a 2-month sampling period in one Midwestern city, we obtained dairy products processed in 20 different states. Here we demonstrate that a tiled-amplicon sequencing approach produced over 90% genome coverage at greater than 20x depth from 5 of 13 viral RNA positive samples, with higher viral copies corresponding to better sequencing success. The sequences clustered phylogenetically within the rest of the cattle outbreak sequences reported. A combination of RT-qPCR testing and sequencing from retail dairy products can be a useful component of a One Health framework for responding to the avian influenza outbreak in cattle.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genomic surveillance from dairy products without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multiple introductions of equine influenza virus into the United Kingdom resulted in widespread outbreaks and lineage replacement.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are prime examples of emerging viruses in humans and animals. IAV circulation in domestic animals poses a pandemic risk as it provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections. The recent emergence of H5N1 IAV in cows and subsequent spread over multiple states within the USA, together with reports of spillover infections in humans, cats and mice highlight this issue. The horse is a domestic animal in which an avian-origin IAV lineage has been circulating for >60 years. In 2018/19, a Florida Clade 1 (FC1) virus triggered one of the largest epizootics recorded in the UK, which led to the replacement of the Equine Influenza Virus (EIV) Florida Clade 2 (FC2) lineage that had been circulating in the country since 2003. We integrated geographical, epidemiological, and virus genetic data to determine the virological and ecological factors leading to this epizootic. By combining newly-sequenced EIV complete genomes derived from UK outbreaks with existing genomic and epidemiological information, we reconstructed the nationwide viral spread and analysed the global evolution of EIV. We show that there was a single EIV FC1 introduction from the USA into Europe, and multiple independent virus introductions from Europe to the UK. At the UK level, three English regions (East, West Midlands, and North-West) were the main sources of virus during the epizootic, and the number of affected premises together with the number of horses in the local area were found as key predictors of viral spread within the country. At the global level, phylogeographic analysis evidenced a source-sink model for intercontinental EIV migration, with a source population evolving in the USA and directly or indirectly seeding viral lineages into sink populations in other continents. Our results provide insight on the underlying factors that influence IAV spread in domestic animals.

Title: Novel Minimal Absent Words Detected in Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: Influenza is a communicable disease caused by RNA viruses. Strains A (affecting animals, humans), B (affecting humans), C (affecting rarely humans and pigs), and D (affecting cattle) comprise a variety of substrains each. Influenza A strain, affecting both humans and animals, is considered the most infectious, causing pandemics. There is an emerging need for the accurate classification of the different influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, elucidating their mode of infection, as well as their fast and accurate diagnosis. Notably, in recent years, oligomeric sequences (words) that are present in the pathogen genomes and entirely absent from the host human genome were suggested to provide robust biomarkers for virus classification and rapid detection. To this end, we performed updated phylogenetic analyses of the IAV hemagglutinin genes, focusing on the sub H1N1 and H5N1. More importantly, we applied in silico methods to identify minimum length "words" that exist consistently in the IAV genomes and are entirely absent from the human genome; these sequences identified in our current analysis may represent minimal signatures that can be utilized to distinguish IAV from other influenza viruses, as well as to perform rapid diagnostic tests.

Title: Improving Influenza Nomenclature Based on Transmission Dynamics.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) evolve rapidly, exhibit zoonotic potential, and frequently adapt to new hosts, often establishing long-term reservoirs. Despite advancements in genetic sequencing and phylogenetic classification, current influenza nomenclature systems remain static, failing to capture evolving epidemiological patterns. This rigidity has led to delays or misinterpretations in public health responses, economic disruptions, and confusion in scientific communication. The existing nomenclature does not adequately reflect real-time transmission dynamics or host adaptations, limiting its usefulness for public health management. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic exemplified these limitations, as it was mischaracterized as "swine flu" despite sustained human-to-human transmission and no direct pig-to-human transmission reported. This review proposes a real-time, transmission-informed nomenclature system that prioritizes host adaptation and sustained transmissibility (R<sub>0</sub> > 1) to align influenza classification with epidemiological realities and risk management. Through case studies of H1N1pdm09, H5N1, and H7N9, alongside a historical overview of influenza naming, we demonstrate the advantages of integrating transmission dynamics into naming conventions. Adopting a real-time, transmission-informed approach will improve pandemic preparedness, strengthen global surveillance, and enhance influenza classification for scientists, policymakers, and public health agencies.

Title: Inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 are essential for an optimal T cell response to influenza.
Abstract: Inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR1/2/3/5 (iCCRs) play an important role in the recruitment of immune cells involved in innate immune functions and orchestrating the adaptive immune response. Here we utilise an influenza A virus (IAV) challenge to investigate the combinatorial roles of the iCCRs in the anti-IAV immune response. We did not observe any gross differences in infection-driven pathology in the absence of iCCRs. iCCR deletion resulted in decreased numbers of some antigen-presenting cell types in the lung (B cells, DC1s, monocytes and inflammatory macrophages), though cell numbers in the draining lymph node were not affected. Whilst the total number of T cells was similar in lungs of iCCR-deficient mice, the number of IAV-specific CD4 but not CD8 T cells in the lung was strongly reduced in the absence of iCCRs. Furthermore, fewer CD4, but not CD8, T cells produced IFN-γ. This CD4 T cell phenotype persisted into the memory stage of infection, with fewer IAV-specific and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> CD4 but not CD8 T cells at 29 days post infection. In conclusion, despite having limited impact on antigen-presenting cell migration between the lung and the draining lymph node, iCCR deletion is associated with an altered CD4 T cell response to IAV infection.

Title: Screening of neurotransmitter receptor modulators reveals novel inhibitors of influenza virus replication.
Abstract: Influenza presents a significant public health threat, as severe cases can lead to excessive inflammation and complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Current antiviral agents targeting viral proteins may lead to the development of resistance, highlighting the need for new agents targeting host factors. Neurotransmitter receptors are vital for cellular signaling and cell cycle modulation, making them promising antiviral therapeutic targets. Recent research has demonstrated that screening libraries of compounds aimed at these receptors can help identify inhibitors that prevent the replication of various viruses, including filoviruses and SARS-CoV-2. We screened a neurotransmitter receptor modulator library in influenza-infected U937 cells and found that many adrenergic, histamine, dopamine, and serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists exhibit antiviral activity. We identified 20 candidate compounds with IC50 values below 20 μM, suggesting a critical role for these receptors in influenza replication. Three representative compounds (isoxsuprine, ciproxifan, and rotigotine) inhibited H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner in multiple cell lines, and were effective against H1N1, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B strains. Mechanistic studies indicated that these compounds affect virus internalization during the early infection stages. In a mouse model of lethal influenza, isoxsuprine significantly decreased lung viral titers, mitigated pulmonary inflammation, and enhanced survival rates. These findings highlight neurotransmitter receptors as potential targets for developing novel anti-influenza agents, providing a foundation for further optimization of the identified compounds as potential therapeutic agents.

Title: Clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses: knowns, unknowns, and challenges.
Abstract: Since 2020, the clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused unprecedented outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry globally, resulting in significant ecological damage and economic losses due to the disease and enforced stamp-out control. In addition to the avian hosts, the H5N1 viruses have expanded their host range to infect many mammalian species, potentially increasing the zoonotic risk. Here, we review the current knowns and unknowns of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 viruses, and we highlight common challenges in prevention. By integrating our knowledge of viral evolution and ecology, we aim to identify discrepancies and knowledge gaps for a more comprehensive understanding of the virus. Ultimately, this review will serve as a theoretical foundation for researchers involved in related avian influenza virus studies, aiding in improved control and prevention of H5N1 viruses.

Title: Comparative Analysis of the Evolutionary Dynamics of Seasonal Influenza Viruses in Madagascar Before and Since the Pandemic Period of COVID-19.
Abstract: Madagascar has maintained an influenza surveillance program for decades. Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, the country implemented strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that disrupted influenza circulation. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in Madagascar over a 5-year period, spanning both the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 pandemic periods: 2019-2023. We showed that global genetic evolution profiles for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses occurred from the pre-pandemic to the pandemic period of COVID-19 in Madagascar. In addition, we observed distinct patterns of viral re-emergence following the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures. This study underscores the importance of sustaining continuous surveillance of influenza virus circulation to monitor the emergence of new variants and identify clade-specific isolates. In addition, these results suggest that targeted NPIs could complement vaccination strategies in reducing influenza transmission and should be integrated into a comprehensive approach for effective influenza control.

Title: Phylogenetic and Molecular Characteristics of Wild Bird-Origin Avian Influenza Viruses Circulating in Poland in 2018-2022: Reassortment, Multiple Introductions, and Wild Bird-Poultry Epidemiological Links.
Abstract: Since 2020, a significant increase in the severity of H5N<i>x</i> highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemics in poultry and wild birds has been observed in Poland. To further investigate the genetic diversity of HPAI H5N<i>x</i> viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b, HPAIV-positive samples collected from dead wild birds in 2020-2022 were phylogenetically characterized. In addition, zoonotic potential and possible reassortment between HPAIVs and LPAIVs circulating in the wild avifauna in Poland have been examined. The genome-wide phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three different avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes (H5N8, H5N5, and H5N1) during the HPAI 2020/2021 season, while in the next HPAI 2021/2022 epidemic only one H5N1 subtype encompassing seven various genotypes (G1-G7) was confirmed. No reassortment events between LPAIVs (detected in the framework of active surveillance) and HPAIVs circulating in Poland have been captured, but instead, epidemiological links between wild birds and poultry due to bidirectional, i.e., wild bird-to-poultry and poultry-to-wild bird HPAIV transmission were evident. Furthermore, at least five independent H5N8 HPAIV introductions into the Baltic Sea region related to unprecedented mass mortality among swans in February-March 2021 in Poland, as well as a general tendency of current H5N<i>x</i> viruses to accumulate specific mutations associated with the ability to break the interspecies barrier were identified. These results highlight the importance of continuous active and passive surveillance for AI to allow a rapid response to emerging viruses.

Title: Emergence of HPAI H5N6 Clade 2.3.4.4b in Wild Birds: A Case Study From South Korea, 2023.
Abstract: The emergence and evolution of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) pose significant challenges to both public health and animal husbandry worldwide. Here, we characterized a novel reassortant highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6, that was isolated from a mandarin duck in South Korea in December 2023. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses show that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the 23-JBN-F12-36/H5N6 virus clustered with HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses, which were circulating in South Korea and Japan in 2022-2023. The M and polymerase acidic (PA) genes also revealed a close association with the HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 AIV that was identified previously in South Korea during November 2022. Notably, the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the 23-JBN-F12-36/H5N6 virus was estimated to have its origins in the HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4h H5N6 prevalent in poultry in China, and it is clustered with the AIVs that are associated with human infection cases. Taken together, these results show that the virus has been produced by reassortment with H5N1 HPAIV, which is prevalent in wild birds; H5N6 HPAIV, which is circulated in poultry in China; and the internal genes of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs). In light of the reassortment of HPAIVs circulating in existing wild birds and HPAIVs circulating in poultry in China within the 2.3.4.4b H5Nx clade, it is imperative to strengthen active surveillance across wild bird populations, poultry farms, and live poultry markets, and to inform for the effective design of improved prevention and control strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes a novel reassortant virus through phylogenetic and molecular analyses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 Influenza Virus in Seabirds in France, 2022-2023.
Abstract: In 2022, a very high number of wild bird deaths associated with the detection of highly pathogenic (HP) H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) lineage Gs/GD/96, clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were unusually observed in Europe between May and September, whereas prior to 2022 most of these HP H5 AIVs detected in wild birds in Europe were almost all detected between October and March and few between April and September. In France, wild birds affected by this virus during this unusual period were mainly seabirds, including larids and sulids. Although the abnormal mortalities in larids and sulids were reported simultaneously, sequencing of the complete genomes of the viruses identified in these seabirds showed that sulids are mainly infected with genotype EA-2020-C, whereas larids are mainly infected with genotype EA-2022-BB. The identification of these two genotypes, therefore, confirmed that there was no direct link between the abnormal mortality observed in sulids and the abnormal mortality observed in larids. These two seabird mortality events can also be distinguished by the evolutionary pattern of the number of detections. Indeed, sulid mortality associated with the EA-2020-C genotype was observed in France only between July and September, corresponding to a single epidemic wave, whereas larid mortality associated with the EA-2022-BB genotype began in France and Europe in May 2022 and then this genotype continued to spread among larids in France in the form of several successive epidemic waves until at least September 2023.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes genotypes associated with seabird mortality and epidemiological patterns but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of Avian Influenza Virus in Pigeons.
Abstract: Pigeons (Columba livia) are usually kept as free-ranging or racing birds, and they have direct contact with livestock, poultry, and humans. Therefore, they may have an important role in the ecology of influenza virus among various species. In the present study, we bring together all available sequence data of pigeon avian influenza virus (AIV) from public databases to address the current understanding of the genomic characteristics and emergence of each subtype of AIV in pigeons. Collectively, we identified 658 pigeon AIV strains in 21 countries across the world, which were mainly distributed in Europe, Asia, and North America. H1 (2), H2 (1), H3 (8), H5 (71), H6 (16), H7 (16), H9 (543), and H11 (1) AIV subtypes have been identified in pigeons. In addition, we interrogate features of the H5, H6, H7, and H9 subtypes of pigeon AIV, which are relatively common in pigeons. It is particularly noteworthy that the H5 AIV strains identified in pigeons are all classified as HPAIV. For the first time, this study presents a complete overview of the multiple AIV subtypes that have been circulating in pigeons, providing information on their distribution and genomic characteristics. This study will help to understand the molecular evolution of AIV in pigeons.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study provides genomic characteristics and distribution of pigeon AIV subtypes but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of a Reassortant Swine- and Human-Origin H3N2 Influenza A Virus in Farmed Mink in British Columbia, Canada.
Abstract: In December 2021, influenza A viruses (IAV) were detected in a population of farmed mink in British Columbia, Canada. Circulation of IAVs in farmed mink populations has raised public health concerns due to similarities between mustelid and human respiratory physiology, potentially facilitating spillover of zoonotic influenzas from livestock. Oropharyngeal specimens were collected from mink as part of a surveillance program for SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic RT-qPCR testing was performed using a multiplex assay targeting SARS-CoV-2, IAV, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Whole viral genome sequencing was conducted on IAV-positive specimens, followed by phylogenetic analysis with other animal and human IAV genome sequences from large global databases. IAVs were detected in 17 of 65 mink by RT-qPCR. Based on genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, these IAVs were subtyped as H3N2s that originated from reassortment of swine H3N2 (clade 1990.4 h), human seasonal H1N1 (pdm09) and swine H1N2 (clade 1A.1.1.3). This reassortant has been subsequently observed in swine in several Midwest American states, as well as in swine and turkeys in Ontario, suggesting its spillover into farmed mink in British Columbia was incidental to its broader dissemination in North American swine populations. These detections reaffirm the need for extensive genomic surveillance of IAVs in swine populations to monitor reassortments that might become public health concerns. They also highlight the need for closer surveillance of IAVs in mink to preserve animal health, protect agricultural interests, and monitor potential zoonotic threats.

Title: Tracking Seasonal Influenza Trends in South Tyrol During 2022/2023 Using Genomic Surveillance Data.
Abstract: Influenza seasons are characterized by a complex interplay of co-circulating strains with high spatial and temporal heterogeneities. Surveillance is crucial for monitoring the spread and evolution of the virus and design effective public health response strategies. We combined epidemiological, virological, and genomic surveillance data to provide a comprehensive analysis of influenza subtypes circulating in the South Tyrol region (Italy) during season 2022/2023, leveraging phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches. Clinical samples were collected from patients exhibiting influenza-like symptoms and evaluated by molecular diagnostics. Whole genome sequencing was conducted, and the hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. A birth-death skyline model was applied to estimate strain-specific effective reproduction numbers (Re) and attack rates. Out of 4891 samples tested, 862 tested positive for influenza, of which 224 genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene revealed A(H3N2) strains predominantly clustering in clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2b, followed by 3C.2a1b.2a.1b. A(H1N1pdm09) strains predominantly clustered in clade 6B.1A.5a.2a. Exclusive circulation of B (Victoria) subtype strains aligned with the global trend, all falling within clade V1A.3a.2. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the strains isolated in the South Tyrol region closely resembled those circulating in the rest of Italy and Austria. Re peaked at 1.16-1.35 (95%CI) for A(H3N2), 1.06-1.34 for A(H1N1pdm09) and 1.02-1.29 for B (Victoria). 95%CI of attack rates were 6.3%-33.5% for A(H3N2), 0.6%-5.0% for A(H1N1pdm09), and 0.8%-6.5% for B (Victoria). Epidemiological estimates from traditional surveillance data can be corroborated by those derived from genomic sequencing, providing more robust assessments of viral transmissibility and attack rates with limited additional effort.

Title: Dynamics of a Panzootic: Genomic Insights, Host Range, and Epidemiology of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b in the United States.
Abstract: In late 2021, Eurasian-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses from HA clade 2.3.4.4b were first detected in the United States. These viruses have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry and have been detected in numerous wild and domestic animals, including cows and humans. Notably, infected cows transmitted the virus to cats, causing extreme pathogenicity and death. While human-to-human spread of the virus has not been recorded, efficient transmission of the bovine-origin virus has also led to extreme pathogenicity and death in ferret models. Recently, markers in PB2 (E627K) and HA (E186D, Q222H), indicating mammalian adaptation mutations, were detected in an H5N1-infected patient manifesting critical illness in Canada. These, combined with instances of interspecies spread of the virus, have raised global public health concerns. This could highlight the potential for the virus to successfully adapt to mammals, posing a serious risk of a global outbreak. A One Health approach is, thereby, necessary to monitor and control the outbreak. This review aims to analyze the epidemiology, transmission, and ecological impacts of HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b in the U.S., identify knowledge gaps, and inform strategies for effective outbreak management and mitigation.

Title: Phylogenetic Study of Local Patterns Influenza A(H3N2) Virus Transmission in a Semi-Isolated Population in a Remote Island in Japan Between 2011 and 2013.
Abstract: Influenza A outbreak risk is impacted by the potential for importation and local transmission. Reconstructing transmission history with phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences can help assess outbreak risk but relies on regular collection of genetic sequences. Few influenza genetic sequences are collected in Japan, which makes phylogenetic analysis challenging, especially in rural, remote settings. We generated influenza A genetic sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) samples collected using rapid influenza diagnostic tests and used them to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza in a remote island in Japan. We generated 229 whole genome sequences of influenza A/H3N2 collected during 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons in Kamigoto Island, Japan, of which 178 sequences passed the quality check. We built time-resolved phylogenetic trees from hemagglutinin sequences to classify the circulating clades by comparing the Kamigoto sequences to global sequences. Spatiotemporal transmission patterns were then analyzed for the largest local clusters. Using a time-resolved phylogenetic tree, we showed that the sequences clustered in six independent transmission groups (1 in 2011/12, 5 in 2012/13). Sequences were closely related to strains from mainland Japan. All 2011/12 strains were identified as clade 3C.2 (n = 29), while 2012/13 strains fell into two clades: clade 3C.2 (n = 129) and 3C.3a (n = 20). Clusters reported in 2012/13 circulated simultaneously in the same regions. The spatiotemporal analysis of the largest cluster revealed that while the first sequences were reported in the busiest district of Kamigoto, the later sequences were scattered across the island. Kamigoto Island was exposed to repeated importations of Influenza A(H3N2), mostly from mainland Japan, sometimes leading to local transmission and ultimately outbreaks. As independent groups of sequences overlapped in time and space, cases may be wrongly allocated to the same transmission group in the absence of genomic surveillance, thereby underestimating the risk of importations. Our analysis highlights how NPS could be used to better understand influenza transmission patterns in little-studied settings and improve influenza surveillance in Japan.

Title: Molecular analysis of influenza A(H3N2) in a remote tropical island during 2014-2019 to identify the frequency of introduction and local circulation.
Abstract: The sources of new antigenic Influenza A(H3N2) variants and the role of tropical regions in the global A(H3N2) circulation remain unclear. By conducting molecular analysis, this study aimed to identify A(H3N2) introduction events and the duration of local circulation in a geographically remote tropical island. Nasopharyngeal/nasal samples were collected from symptomatic children under 5 years old in a remote tropical island of the Philippines between 2014 and 2019. From the 330 A(H3N2) strains detected, 150 were sequenced for the Hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) gene. Time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified introduction events from global A(H3N2) circulation. We estimated the duration of local circulation and its association with detected amino acid substitutions. Six different A(H3N2) clades/subclades circulated during the study period. Of the 15 introduction events identified during this period, 13 resulted in local circulation lasting less than 3 months, while one led to 5-month-long circulation. Another 10-month-long local circulation event, by definition, was more likely the result of two distinct introduction events with local circulation lasting less than 3 months, respectively. Most amino acid substitutions that emerged during local circulation were sporadic. No fixed substitutions appeared at the seven key amino acid sites for antigenic changes, suggesting that introduced strains were maintained without the emergence of new antigenic variants. In our study population, A(H3N2) circulation resulted from multiple introduction events, followed by local circulation lasting less than 3 months, with occasional long-term persistence. Our study indicates that tropical regions may contribute to maintaining globally circulating strains but may not be a source of antigenic variants.

Title: Etiological Spectrum of Acute Respiratory Infections in Bulgaria During the 2023-2024 Season and Genetic Diversity of Circulating Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza poses a serious threat to both individual and public health. This study aimed to investigate the virological and epidemiological characteristics of influenza infections and to explore the genetic diversity of the circulating influenza viruses. In total, 1886 nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with acute respiratory illnesses were tested against 13 respiratory viruses using a multiplex real-time PCR. Whole-genome sequencing, phylogenetic, and amino acid analyses of representative influenza strains were performed. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 869 (46.1%) patients; 87 (4.6%) were co-infected with two or three viruses. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most prevalent virus (16.1%), followed by rhinoviruses (8.1%) and RSV (6.7%). Hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the 74 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were categorized in subclades C.1.8, C.1.9, and C.1 within clade 5a.2a and D1, D.2, and D.3 within clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H3N2) viruses analyzed belonged to clade 2a.3a.1, subclades J.2 and J.1. The sequenced B/Victoria lineage viruses fell into clade V1A.3a.2, subclades C.5.6 and C.5.7. Amino acid substitutions in most viral proteins were identified compared with the vaccine strains, including in the HA antigenic sites. This study demonstrated the dominant distribution of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus among the respiratory viruses studied and the genetic diversity of the circulating influenza viruses.

Title: Impact of Viral Co-Detection on the Within-Host Viral Diversity of Influenza Patients.
Abstract: Numerous studies have documented the evidence of virus-virus interactions at the population, host, and cellular levels. However, the impact of these interactions on the within-host diversity of influenza viral populations remains unexplored. Our study identified 13 respiratory viral pathogens from the nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPSs) of influenza-like-illness (ILI) patients during the 2012/13 influenza season using multiplex RT-PCR. Subsequent next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A infections revealed all samples as subtype A/H3N2. Out of the 2305 samples tested, 538 (23.3%) were positive for the influenza A virus (IAV), while rhinovirus (RV) and adenoviruses (Adv) were detected in 264 (11.5%) and 44 (1.9%) samples, respectively. Among these, the co-detection of more than one virus was observed in ninety-six samples, and five samples showed co-detections involving more than two viruses. The most frequent viral co-detection was IAV-RV, identified in 48 out of the 96 co-detection cases. Of the total samples, 150 were processed for whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and 132 met the criteria for intra-host single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) calling. Across the genome, 397 unique iSNVs were identified, with most samples containing fewer than five iSNVs at frequencies below 10%. Seven samples had no detectable iSNVs. Notably, the majority of iSNVs (86%) were unique and rarely shared across samples. We conducted a negative binomial regression analysis to examine factors associated with the number of iSNVs detected within hosts. Two age groups-elderly individuals (>64 years old) and school-aged children (6-18 years old)-were significantly associated with higher iSNV counts, with incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.06) and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.01-1.90), respectively. Our findings suggest a minor or negligible contribution of these viral co-detections to the evolution of influenza viruses. However, the data available in this study may not be exhaustive, warranting further, more in-depth investigations to conclusively determine the impact of virus-virus interactions on influenza virus genetic diversity.

Title: Epidemiology and Genetic Evolutionary Analysis of Influenza Virus Among Children in Hainan Island, China, 2021-2023.
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we continuously monitored the epidemiology of influenza virus among pediatric patients from January 2021 to December 2023 in Hainan Island, China. In this study, we collected 54,974 nasopharyngeal swab samples for influenza A Virus (IAV) testing and 53,151 samples for influenza B Virus (IBV) testing from pediatric outpatients. Additionally, we also collected 19,687 nasopharyngeal swab samples from pediatric inpatients for IAV and IBV testing. Outpatient samples were screened for influenza viruses (IVs) infection by the colloidal gold method. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (tNGS) was used to detect influenza virus infections in inpatients. Influenza virus types were identified by analyzing the HA/NA partial regions. The findings revealed a significant decrease in the infection rate of IBV over the specified period, while the infection rate of IAV exhibited a rising trend. Additionally, B/Victoria lineage was the dominant epidemic strain in 2021, while the epidemic strains in 2022 and 2023 underwent a dynamic transformation from A/H3N2 to A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relationships among the circulating strains. Nonetheless, because the sample size is limited, additional research is required. Our findings suggest that the predominant types of influenza viruses in the pediatric population are undergoing dynamic changes, influenced by the implementation and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. These findings highlight the need for adaptive influenza vaccination and containment strategies, particularly in tropical regions like Hainan, where climate and public health policies significantly impact viral transmission patterns. The insights gained from this study could inform more effective public health strategies in similar regions to mitigate the impact of influenza outbreaks in the future.

Title: Molecular Analysis of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Group B Strains Isolated in Kenya Before and During the Emergence of Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1.
Abstract: We conducted a retrospective study to explore molecular insights into human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) group B strains among patients attending outpatient clinics at government medical facilities both prior and during the onset of Influenza A/H1N1/2009 pandemic outbreak. We screened 2300 nasopharyngeal swabs using multiplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We amplified a segment of the first and second hypervariable regions, as well as the conserved portion of the third domain of the G-gene using HRSV-B specific primers, sequenced by Sanger di-deoxy chain termination method and thereafter analyzed the sequences. We characterized the circulating strains into three known genotypes: SAB4 (1.4%), BA7 (1.4%), and multiple variants of BA9 (97.2%). The majority of BA9 viruses were uniquely Kenyan with only 4% aligning with BA9 lineages found elsewhere. The mean evolutionary rate of the HRSV-B was estimated to be 3.08 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year. Our findings indicate that the circulating HRSV-B viruses in Kenya underwent a slower evolution during the period of 2007-2010. Additionally, our findings reveal the existence of a unique lineage as well as new variants that have not been reported elsewhere to date.

Title: Research Note: Novel reassortant avian influenza A(H9N2) Viruses in Wild Birds in Shanghai, China, 2020-2023.
Abstract: The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus poses significant challenges to global poultry and human health. During the active surveillance of avian influenza virus in wild birds in Shanghai from 2020 to 2023, a total of nine H9N2 viruses were identified. To better understand the genetic characteristics of these H9N2 viruses in Shanghai, the whole genome sequences were analyzed. Phylogenetical analysis showed that the nine H9N2 viruses have undergone complicated reassortment with waterfowl viruses along the East Asian-Australasian flyways. The nine H9N2 viruses were classified into seven genotypes, and some of them could contribute internal genes to recently circulating HPAI A(H5N8) and A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b. These results highlight the importance of active surveillance of AIVs in wild birds to comprehend viral ecology and evaluate potential transmission risk in poultry and humans.

Title: Ecological drivers of evolution of swine influenza in the United States: a review.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a major public health threat due to their wide host range and pandemic potential. Pigs have been proposed as "mixing vessels" for avian, swine, and human IAVs, significantly contributing to influenza ecology. In the United States, IAVs are enzootic in commercial swine farming operations, with numerous genetic and antigenic IAV variants having emerged in the past two decades. However, the dynamics of intensive swine farming systems and their interactions with ecological factors influencing IAV evolution have not been systematically analysed. This review examines the evolution of swine IAVs in commercial farms, highlighting the role of multilevel ecological factors. A total of 61 articles published after 2000 were reviewed, with most studies conducted after 2009 in Midwestern US, followed by Southeast and South-central US. The findings reveal that ecological factors at multiple spatial scales, such as regional transportation networks, interconnectedness of swine operations, farm environments, and presence of high-density, low-genetic diversity herds, can facilitate virus transmission and enhance virus evolution. Additionally, interactions at various interfaces, such as between commercial swine and feral swine, humans, or wild birds contribute to the increase in genetic diversity of swine IAVs. The review underscores the need for comprehensive studies and improved data collection to better understand the ecological dynamics influencing swine IAV evolution. This understanding is crucial for mitigating disease burden in swine production and reducing the risk of zoonotic influenza outbreaks.

Reason: This is a review paper discussing ecological drivers of swine influenza evolution without presenting explicit genotype-phenotype linkage data.

Title: Disruption of seasonal influenza circulation and evolution during the 2009 H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics in Southeastern Asia.
Abstract: East, South, and Southeast Asia (together referred to as Southeastern Asia hereafter) have been recognized as critical areas fuelling the global circulation of seasonal influenza. However, the seasonal influenza migration network within Southeastern Asia remains unclear, including how pandemic-related disruptions altered this network. We leveraged genetic, epidemiological, and airline travel data between 2007-2023 to characterise the dispersal patterns of influenza A/H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses both out of and within Southeastern Asia, including during perturbations by the 2009 A/H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent autumn-winter movement waves from Southeastern Asia to temperate regions were interrupted for both subtype/lineages, however the A/H1N1 pandemic only disrupted A/H3N2 spread. We find a higher persistence of A/H3N2 than B/Victoria circulation in Southeastern Asia and identify distinct pandemic-related disruptions in A/H3N2 antigenic evolution between two pandemics, compared to interpandemic levels; similar patterns are observed in B/Victoria using genetic distance. The internal movement structure within Southeastern Asia markedly diverged during the COVID-19 pandemic season, and to a lesser extent, during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic season. Our findings provide insights into the heterogeneous impact of two distinct pandemic-related disruptions on influenza circulation, which can help anticipate the effects of future pandemics and potential mitigation strategies on influenza dynamics.

Title: Genotypic Clustering of H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses in North America Evaluated by Ordination Analysis.
Abstract: The introduction of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses to North America in late 2021 resulted in avian influenza outbreaks in poultry, mortality events in many wild bird species, and spillovers into many mammalian species. Reassortment events with North American low-pathogenic virus were identified as early as February 2022 and over 100 genotypes have been characterized. Such diversity increases the complexity and time required for monitoring virus evolution. Here, we performed ordination and clustering analyses on sequence data from H5N1 viruses identified in North America between January 2020 and December 2023 to visualize the genotypic diversity of viruses in poultry and wildlife populations. Our results reveal that ordination- and cluster-based approaches can complement traditional phylogenetic analyses specifically for the preliminary assignment of H5N1 viruses to genotypic groups or to identify novel genotypes. Our study expands current knowledge on the genotypic diversity of H5N1 viruses in North America and describes a rapid approach for early virus genotype assignment.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genotypic clustering and ordination analysis of H5N1 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic characteristics.

Title: Coinfection of avian hepatitis E virus and different serotypes of fowl adenovirus in chicken flocks in Shaanxi, China.
Abstract: In poultry, fowl adenovirus (FAdV) and co-infected viruses (such as avian hepatitis E virus, aHEV) are likely to cause decreased egg production, inclusion body hepatitis, and pericardial effusion syndrome. From July to September 2023, eight poultry farms of commercial broilers and commercial layers suffered from increased mortality, decreased egg production, and the presence of hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome-like gross lesions in Shaanxi province, China. To determine the source of the infection, the viruses of aHEV, FAdV, avian leukosis virus (ALV), Marek's disease virus (MDV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) were detected. A total of 240 liver samples were collected from eight farms and detected by molecular etiology methods. The samples were tested positive for FAdV and aHEV and negative for NDV, MDV, ALV, and H9N2 AIV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the hexon loop-1 gene showed that these isolates were clustered into three distinct serotypes: FAdV serotype 4 (FAdV-4), FAdV-8a, and FAdV-8b. The partial ORF2 gene sequences obtained in this study shared the highest identity (76%-97%) with corresponding sequences of other known avian HEV isolates and belonged to gene type 3 avian HEV. Meanwhile, the isolated FAdV in this study could multiply in leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells. Overall, the disease may be mainly caused by FAdV and aHEV coinfection on these farms, and this is the first study to discover FAdV-4/8a/8b and avian HEV coinfection in a farm in China. Last year, eight poultry farms of commercial broilers and commercial layers suffered a serious disease in Shaanxi province, China. After molecular etiological investigation, the disease may be mainly caused by fowl adenovirus (FAdV) (FAdV-4, FAdV-8a, and FAdV-8b) and avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV) (genotype 3 avian HEV) coinfection on these flocks, and this is the first study to find FAdV-4/8a/8b and avian HEV coinfection in a farm. It provides a valuable foundation for the prevention and control of FAdV and avian HEV coinfection in chicken farms.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on coinfection of avian hepatitis E virus and fowl adenovirus in chickens, with phylogenetic analysis of serotypes but no explicit link between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Genetic diversity of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 and H5N8 viruses in poultry markets in Guangdong, China, 2020-2022.
Abstract: H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/Gd) lineage continue to evolve and cause outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild birds, with sporadic spillover infections in mammals. The global spread of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses via migratory birds since 2020 has facilitated the introduction of novel reassortants to China, where avian influenza of various subtypes have been epizootic or enzootic among domestic birds. To determine the impact of clade 2.3.4.4b re-introduction on local HPAI dynamics, we analyzed the genetic diversity of H5N6 and H5N8 detected from monthly poultry market surveillance in Guangdong, China, between 2020 and 2022. Our findings reveal that H5N6 viruses clustered in clades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.4.4h, while H5N8 viruses were exclusively clustered in clade 2.3.4.4b. After 2020, the re-introduced clade 2.3.4.4b viruses replaced the clade 2.3.4.4h viruses detected in 2020. The N6 genes were divided into two clusters, distinguished by an 11 amino acid deletion in the stalk region, while the N8 genes clustered with clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses circulating among wild birds. Genomic analysis identified 10 transient genotypes. H5N6, which was more prevalently detected, was also clustered into more genotypes than H5N8. Specifically, H5N6 isolates contained genes derived from HPAI H5Nx viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza in China, while the H5N8 isolates contained genes derived from HPAI A(H5N8) 2.3.4.4b and A(H5N1) 2.3.2.1c. No positive selection on amino acid residues associated with mammalian adaptation was found. Our results suggest expanded genetic diversity of H5Nx viruses in China since 2021 with increasing challenges for pandemic preparedness.IMPORTANCESince 2016/2017, clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses have spread via migratory birds to all continents except Oceania. Here, we evaluated the impact of the re-introduction of clade of 2.3.4.4b on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus genetic diversity in China. Twenty-two H5N6 and H5N8 HPAI isolated from monthly surveillance in two poultry markets in Guangdong between 2020 and 2022 were characterized. Our findings showed that clade 2.3.4.4h, detected in 2020, was replaced by clade 2.3.4.4b in 2021-2022. H5N6 (<i>n</i> = 18) were clustered into more genotypes than H5N8 (<i>n</i> = 4), suggesting that H5N6 may possess better replication fitness in poultry. Conversely, the H5N8 genotypes are largely derived from the clade 2.3.4.4b wild bird isolates. As clade 2.3.4.4b continues to spread via migratory birds, it is anticipated that the genetic diversity of H5N6 viruses circulating in China may continue to expand in the coming years. Continuous efforts in surveillance, genetic analysis, and risk assessment are therefore crucial for pandemic preparedness.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of H5N6 and H5N8 viruses but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Surveillance for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in the Lombardy Region (Italy) in the Period 2022-2024.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (AIV) circulation was investigated in the Lombardy region, during 2022-2024, in wild ducks (through hunting and sampling of faecal samples within natural parks) and wild birds found dead. Samples were analysed through real-time RT-PCRs for Influenza A virus, H5 and H7. Whole genome sequencing was performed on AIV-positive samples. Screening of 3497 hunted Anatidae revealed a total of 184 positive samples. Complete sequencing of 136 samples highlighted the presence of 21 different subtypes ranging from H1N1 to H12N5. The H5N1 HPAIV (high pathogenic AIV) subtype, clade 2.3.4.4b, was the most common during the 2022-2023 winter season (31.8%), while H5 LPAI (low pathogenic AIV) strains were the most prevalent (28.6%) in the 2023-2024 season. The molecular survey on wild birds found dead (<i>n</i> = 481) showed two positive buzzards (14%, 2/14), one grey heron (5.5%, 1/18) and one kestrel (7.6%, 1/13). Regarding the order of <i>Charadriiformes</i>, the dead gulls sampled in 2022 (17 birds) were all negative, whereas 85 out of 167 (51%) individuals were positive in 2023. All positives were caused by an H5N1 HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b virus belonging to genotype BB. All the faecal samples (1699) received from passive surveillance in nature parks were analysed for AIV with negative results.

Title: Mass Mortality in Terns and Gulls Associated with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan.
Abstract: Mass mortality in Caspian terns (<i>Hydroprogne caspia</i>), Pallas's gulls (<i>Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus</i>), and Caspian gulls (<i>Larus cachinnans</i>) was recorded on the northeastern shores of the Caspian Sea in June 2022. More than 5000 gulls and terns died due to the outbreak. The outbreak was investigated in the field, and representative numbers of samples were collected and analyzed using pathological, virological, and molecular methods. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses were detected and isolated from samples collected from dead birds. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the hemagglutinin (<i>HA</i>) genes belonged to the clade 2.3.4.4.b of the H5Nx HPAI viruses, B2 sub-lineage, and were closely related to the highly pathogenic influenza viruses, caused an outbreak in wild birds with a high mortality rate in the western part of the Caspian Sea.

Title: Phylogenetic Insights into H7Nx Influenza Viruses: Uncovering Reassortment Patterns and Geographic Variability.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs), which belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, are RNA viruses characterized by a segmented genome that allows them to evolve and adapt rapidly. These viruses are mainly transmitted by wild waterfowl. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary processes of H7Nx (H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N5, H7N6, H7N7, H7N8, H7N9) viruses, which pose a significant pandemic risk due to the known cases of human infection and their potential for rapid genetic evolution and reassortment. The complete genome sequences of H7Nx influenza viruses (<i>n</i> = 3239) were compared between each other to investigate their phylogenetic relationships and reassortment patterns. For the selected viruses, phylogenetic trees were constructed for eight genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS) to assess the genetic diversity and geographic distribution of these viruses. Distinct phylogenetic clades with remarkable geographic patterns were found for the different segments. While the viruses were consistently grouped by subtype based on the NA segment sequences, the phylogeny of the other segment sequences, with the exception of the NS segment, showed distinct grouping patterns based on geographic origin rather than formal subtype assignment. Reassortment events leading to complex phylogenetic relationships were frequently observed. In addition, multiple cases of previously undescribed reassortments between subtypes were detected, emphasizing the fluidity of H7Nx virus populations. These results indicate a high degree of genetic diversity and reassortment within H7Nx influenza viruses. In other words, H7Nx viruses exist as constantly changing combinations of gene pools rather than stable genetic lineages.

Reason: The paper analyzes phylogenetic relationships and reassortment patterns of H7Nx viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: In Silico Genomic Analysis of Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated From Marine Seal Colonies.
Abstract: Genetically diverse avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are maintained in wild aquatic birds with increasingly frequent spillover into mammals, yet these represent a small proportion of the overall detections. The isolation of AIVs in marine mammals, including seals, has been reported sporadically over the last 45 years. Prior to 2016, all reports of AIVs detected in seals were of low-pathogenicity AIVs. In spite of this, the majority of reported AIV outbreaks caused fatal respiratory diseases, with harbor seals particularly susceptible to infection. The H5 clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) was detected in seals for the first time in 2016. Recently, many cases of mass seal die-offs have occurred because of 2.3.4.4b HPAIV and are attributed to spillover from wild bird species. The potential for seal-to-seal transmission has been considered after the mass mortality of southern elephant seals off the coast of Argentina. Close contact between seals and wild birds, the rapid evolution of H5N1 AIVs, and the possibility of efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission are increasing concerns due to the potential for the establishment of a marine mammal reservoir and public health risks associated with the pandemic potential of the virus. This manuscript details the detection of AIVs in the seal population, comparing interesting features of various subtypes with an emphasis on avian-to-mammal-to-mammal transmission. Phylogenetic characterizations of the representative seal isolates were performed to demonstrate the relationships within the different virus isolates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reassortment events between different LPAIVs occurred before and after the viruses reached the seal population. The reassortment of viral segments plays an important role in the evolution of influenza viruses. Taken together, these data report on the 45 year history between seals and AIVs.

Reason: The paper provides phylogenetic characterization and reassortment history of avian influenza viruses in seals but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection and characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus circulating in Argentina in 2023.
Abstract: In 2021, avian influenza A (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus spread to North America and then to Central and South America in October 2022, extending from Colombia to Chile in three months. During 2023, several countries, mostly in the Americas, reported outbreaks in poultry, wild birds and mammals, as well as the emergence of two cases in humans (one in Ecuador in January and one in Chile in March). As of September 20th, 2023, 17 countries in the Americas Region have recorded cases of A (H5N1) in birds and mammals. On February 14th, 2023, Argentina confirmed the first case of avian influenza in wild birds, which was later detected in backyard and commercial poultry, and in the South-American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) in Tierra del Fuego, in the south of the country. So far, 21 suspected cases have been recorded in humans; however, all of them tested negative for Influenza A virus. Hemagglutinin sequence data of animal viruses analyzed in this report showed that Argentinian viruses clustered together with those isolated in other countries of the region. Epidemiological data suggested the possibility of multiple simultaneous entries of the avian virus, highlighting the role of migratory avian populations in the introduction and dissemination of the disease in Argentina. Continued comprehensive surveillance of these viruses in animals and people worldwide, along with ongoing preparedness efforts, are critical to determine the public health risk.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on detection, phylogenetic clustering, and epidemiology of H5N1 viruses in Argentina without explicit discussion of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic interventions reshaped the global dispersal of seasonal influenza viruses.
Abstract: The global dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses inform the design of surveillance, intervention, and vaccination strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic's onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.

Title: Discriminating North American Swine Influenza Viruses with a Portable, One-Step, Triplex Real-Time RT-PCR Assay, and Portable Sequencing.
Abstract: Swine harbors a genetically diverse population of swine influenza A viruses (IAV-S), with demonstrated potential to transmit to the human population, causing outbreaks and pandemics. Here, we describe the development of a one-step, triplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay that detects and distinguishes the majority of the antigenically distinct influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) clades currently circulating in North American swine, including the IAV-S H1 1A.1 (α), 1A.2 (β), 1A.3 (γ), 1B.2.2 (δ1) and 1B.2.1 (δ2) clades, and the IAV-S H3 2010.1 clade. We performed an in-field test at an exhibition swine show using in-field viral concentration and RNA extraction methodologies and a portable real-time PCR instrument, and rapidly identified three distinct IAV-S clades circulating within the N.A. swine population. Portable sequencing is used to further confirm the results of the in-field test of the swine triplex assay. The IAV-S triplex rRT-PCR assay can be easily transported and used in-field to characterize circulating IAV-S clades in North America, allowing for surveillance and early detection of North American IAV-S with human outbreak and pandemic potential.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development of a PCR assay and portable sequencing for detection and differentiation of swine influenza virus clades, focusing on surveillance rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Detection and subtyping of influenza A virus in porcine clinical samples from Spain in 2020.
Abstract: A total of 1019 samples collected on 726 Spanish swine farms suffering from outbreaks of respiratory disease were screened for influenza A viruses (IAVs) using a RT-qPCR method. A subset of positive samples was further analyzed using a subtype-specific RT-qPCR method (n: 142) and Sanger sequencing (n: 64). A total of 19.4% samples from 23% farms tested positive, with infection being most common in suckling (53.6%) and weaning pigs (30.2%). Viruses belonging to four HA subtypes (H1av, H1hu, H1pdm, H3) were detected, with subtypes H1avN2, H1huN2 and H1avN1 accounting for over half of the specimens. An optimized protocol with newly designed primers allowed the detection of H3 viruses in a significant number of samples (21%). A comparison of antigenic positions revealed that circulating strains exhibited mutations with vaccine strains in a significant percentage of amino acid residues, both in the NA protein (27.8-43.3%) and particularly in the HA protein (51-75.3%).

Title: Characterization of Conserved Evolution in H7N9 Avian Influenza Virus Prior Mass Vaccination.
Abstract: Vaccination is crucial for the prevention and mitigation of avian influenza infections in China. The inactivated H7N9 vaccine, when administered to poultry, significantly lowers the risk of infection among both poultry and humans, while also markedly decreasing the prevalence of H7N9 detections. Highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 viruses occasionally appear, whereas their low pathogenicity (LP) counterparts have been scarcely detected since 2018. However, these contributing factors remain poorly understood. We conducted an exploratory investigation of the mechanics via the application of comprehensive bioinformatic approaches. We delineated the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) H7N9 lineage into 5 clades (YRD-A to E). Our findings highlight the emergence and peak occurrence of the LP H7N9-containing YRD-E clade during the 5th epidemic wave in China's primary poultry farming areas. A more effective control of LP H7N9 through vaccination was observed compared to that of its HP H7N9 counterpart. YRD-E exhibited a tardy evolutionary trajectory, denoted by the conservation of its genetic and antigenic variation. Our analysis of YRD-E revealed only minimal amino acid substitutions along its phylogenetic tree and a few selective sweep mutations since 2016. In terms of epidemic fitness, the YRD-E was measured to be lower than that of the HP variants. Collectively, these findings underscore the conserved evolutionary patterns distinguishing the YRD-E. Given the conservation presented in its evolutionary patterns, the YRD-E LP H7N9 is hypothesized to be associated with a reduction following the mass vaccination in a relatively short period owing to its lower probability of antigenic variation that might affect vaccine efficiency.

Reason: The study focuses on evolutionary patterns and genetic conservation of H7N9 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Farmed fur animals harbour viruses with zoonotic spillover potential.
Abstract: Animals such as raccoon dogs, mink and muskrats are farmed for fur and are sometimes used as food or medicinal products<sup>1,2</sup>, yet they are also potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens<sup>3</sup>. Here we performed single-sample metatranscriptomic sequencing of internal tissues from 461 individual fur animals that were found dead due to disease. We characterized 125 virus species, including 36 that were novel and 39 at potentially high risk of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spillover. Notably, we identified seven species of coronaviruses, expanding their known host range, and documented the cross-species transmission of a novel canine respiratory coronavirus to raccoon dogs and of bat HKU5-like coronaviruses to mink, present at a high abundance in lung tissues. Three subtypes of influenza A virus-H1N2, H5N6 and H6N2-were detected in the lungs of guinea pig, mink and muskrat, respectively. Multiple known zoonotic viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and mammalian orthoreovirus<sup>4,5</sup>, were detected in guinea pigs. Raccoon dogs and mink carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses, while viruses from the Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Sedoreoviridae families commonly infected multiple hosts. These data also reveal potential virus transmission between farmed animals and wild animals, and from humans to farmed animals, indicating that fur farming represents an important transmission hub for viral zoonoses.

Title: Detection and spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus H5N1 in the Antarctic Region.
Abstract: Until recent events, the Antarctic was the only major geographical region in which high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) had never previously been detected. Here we report on the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, respectively. We initially detected H5N1 HPAIV in samples collected from brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia on 8th October 2023. Since this detection, mortalities were observed in several avian and mammalian species at multiple sites across South Georgia. Subsequent testing confirmed H5N1 HPAIV across several sampling locations in multiple avian species and two seal species. Simultaneously, we also confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in southern fulmar and black-browed albatross in the Falkland Islands. Genetic assessment of the virus indicates spread from South America, likely through movement of migratory birds. Critically, genetic assessment of sequences from mammalian species demonstrates no increased risk to human populations above that observed in other instances of mammalian infections globally. Here we describe the detection, species impact and genetic composition of the virus and propose both introductory routes and potential long-term impact on avian and mammalian species across the Antarctic region. We also speculate on the threat to specific populations following recent reports in the area.

Reason: The study reports detection and genetic assessment of H5N1 viruses in Antarctic region species but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Spatial patterns of influenza A virus spread across compartments in commercial swine farms in the United States.
Abstract: Multiple genetic variants of H1 and H3 influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate concurrently in US swine farms. Understanding the spatial transmission patterns of IAVs among these farms is crucial for developing effective control strategies and mitigating the emergence of novel IAVs. In this study, we analysed 1909 IAV genomic sequences from 785 US swine farms, representing 33 farming systems across 12 states, primarily in the Midwest from 2004 to 2023. Bayesian phylogeographic analyses were performed to identify the dispersal patterns of both H1 and H3 virus genetic lineages and to elucidate their spatial migration patterns within and between different systems. Our results showed that both intra-system and inter-system migrations occurred between the swine farms, with intra-system migrations being more frequent. However, migration rates for H1 and H3 IAVs were similar between intra-system and inter-system migration events. Spatial migration patterns aligned with expected pig movement across different compartments of swine farming systems. Sow-Farms were identified as key sources of viruses, with bi-directional migration observed between these farms and other parts of the system, including Wean-to-Finish and Gilt-Development-Units. High intra-system migration was detected across farms in the same region, while spread to geographically distant intra- and inter-system farms was less frequent. These findings suggest that prioritizing resources towards systems frequently confronting influenza problems and targeting pivotal source farms, such as sow farms, could be an effective strategy for controlling influenza in US commercial swine operations.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Hebei Province of China from 2021 to 2023: Identification of a novel reassortant H3N3.
Abstract: Avian influenza remains a global public health concern for its well-known point mutation and genomic segment reassortment, through which plenty of serum serotypes are generated to escape existing immune protection in animal and human populations. Some occasional cases of human infection of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) since 2020 posed a potential pandemic risk through human-to-human transmission. Both east-west and north-south migratory birds fly through and linger in the Hebei Province of China as a stopover habitat, providing an opportunity for imported AIVs to infect the local poultry and for viral gene reassortment to generate novel stains. In this study, we collected more than 6000 environmental samples (mostly feces) in Hebei Province from 2021 to 2023. Samples were screened using real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation was performed using the chick embryo culture method. We identified 10 AIV isolates, including a novel reassortant H3N3 isolate. Sequencing analysis revealed these AIVs are highly homologous to those isolated in the Yellow River Basin. Our findings supported that AIVs keep evolving to generate new isolates, necessitating a continuous risk assessment of local avian influenza in wild waterfowl in Hebei, China.

Title: Phylogeography and reassortment patterns of human influenza A viruses in sub-Saharan Africa.
Abstract: The role of sub-Saharan Africa in the global spread of influenza viruses remains unclear due to insufficient spatiotemporal sequence data. Here, we analyzed 222 codon-complete sequences of influenza A viruses (IAVs) sampled between 2011 and 2013 from five countries across sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Zambia, Mali, Gambia, and South Africa); these genomes were compared with 1209 contemporaneous global genomes using phylogeographical approaches. The spread of influenza in sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by (i) multiple introductions of IAVs into the region over consecutive influenza seasons, with viral importations originating from multiple global geographical regions, some of which persisted in circulation as intra-subtype reassortants for multiple seasons, (ii) virus transfer between sub-Saharan African countries, and (iii) virus export from sub-Saharan Africa to other geographical regions. Despite sparse data from influenza surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, our findings support the notion that influenza viruses persist as temporally structured migrating metapopulations in which new virus strains can emerge in any geographical region, including in sub-Saharan Africa; these lineages may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within understudied sub-Saharan Africa regions is required to inform vaccination strategies in those regions.

Title: Descriptive epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in British Columbia (B.C.) and the Yukon, Canada, September 2022 to June 2023.
Abstract: Surveillance data from wildlife and poultry was used to describe the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in British Columbia (B.C.) and the Yukon, Canada from September 2022 - June 2023 compared to the first "wave" of the outbreak in this region, which occurred April - August 2022, after the initial viral introduction. Although the number of HPAI-positive poultry farms and wildlife samples was greater in "Wave 2", cases were more tightly clustered in southwestern B.C. and the most commonly affected species differed, likely due to an influx of overwintering waterfowl in the area. Eight HPAI genetic clusters, representing seven genotypes and two inter-continental viral incursions, were detected, with significant variation in the relative abundance of each cluster between the waves. Phylogenetic data suggests multiple spillover events from wild birds to poultry and mammals but could not rule out transmission among farms and among mammals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Decoding the RNA viromes in shrew lungs along the eastern coast of China.
Abstract: Shrews being insectivores, serve as natural reservoirs for a wide array of zoonotic viruses, including the recently discovered Langya henipavirus (LayV) in China in 2018. It is crucial to understand the shrew-associated virome, viral diversity, and new viruses. In the current study, we conducted high-throughput sequencing on lung samples obtained from 398 shrews captured along the eastern coast of China, and characterized the high-depth virome of 6 common shrew species (Anourosorex squamipes, Crocidura lasiura, Crocidura shantungensis, Crocidura tanakae, Sorex caecutiens, and Suncus murinus). Our analysis revealed numerous shrew-associated viruses comprising 54 known viruses and 72 new viruses that significantly enhance our understanding of mammalian viruses. Notably, 34 identified viruses possess spillover-risk potential and six were human pathogenic viruses: LayV, influenza A virus (H5N6), rotavirus A, rabies virus, avian paramyxovirus 1, and rat hepatitis E virus. Moreover, ten previously unreported viruses in China were discovered, six among them have spillover-risk potential. Additionally, all 54 known viruses and 12 new viruses had the ability to cross species boundaries. Our data underscore the diversity of shrew-associated viruses and provide a foundation for further studies into tracing and predicting emerging infectious diseases originated from shrews.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes viral diversity and identifies viruses with spillover potential but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Ecology and evolution of avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Four types of influenza virus have been identified in nature: influenza A, B, and C viruses are capable of infecting humans, and influenzas A and B cause annual epidemics (seasonal flu) in humans; however, influenza D is currently known to infect only pigs and cattle. The influenza A viruses (IAVs) are of greatest importance to humans, causing widespread significant morbidity and mortality, and have been responsible for at least five pandemics documented since the beginning of the 20th century (Table 1). The H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs continue to circulate in humans as seasonal influenza. In addition to humans, IAVs have a wide range of host animal species in nature, especially wild aquatic birds, the reservoir hosts of IAVs. The IAVs isolated from or adapted to an avian host are named avian influenza viruses (AIVs), and are of great concern owing to their involvement in the genesis of pandemic and outbreak strains. Moreover, the majority of AIVs persist in wild birds and domestic poultry, and novel variants continue to emerge in birds and other hosts, posing non-negligible threats to host ecology and public health.

Title: One hundred years of influenza A evolution.
Abstract: Leveraging the simplicity of nucleotide mismatch distributions, we provide an intuitive window into the evolution of the human influenza A 'nonstructural' (NS) gene segment. In an analysis suggested by the eminent Danish biologist Freddy B. Christiansen, we illustrate the existence of a continuous genetic "backbone" of influenza A NS sequences, steadily increasing in nucleotide distance to the 1918 root over more than a century. The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic represents a clear departure from this enduring genetic backbone. Utilizing nucleotide distance maps and phylogenetic analyses, we illustrate remaining uncertainties regarding the origin of the 2009 pandemic, highlighting the complexity of influenza evolution. The NS segment is interesting precisely because it experiences less pervasive positive selection, and departs less strongly from neutral evolution than e.g. the HA antigen. Consequently, sudden deviations from neutral diversification can indicate changes in other genes via the hitchhiking effect. Our approach employs two measures based on nucleotide mismatch counts to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the NS gene segment. The rooted Hamming map of distances between a reference sequence and all other sequences over time, and the unrooted temporal Hamming distribution which captures the distribution of genotypic distances between simultaneously circulating viruses, thereby revealing patterns of nucleotide diversity and epi-evolutionary dynamics.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on genetic evolution and phylogenetics of the NS gene segment without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Proposal for a Global Classification and Nomenclature System for A/H9 Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A/H9 viruses circulate worldwide in wild and domestic avian species, continuing to evolve and posing a zoonotic risk. A substantial increase in human infections with A/H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and the emergence of novel reassortants carrying A/H9N2-origin internal genes has occurred in recent years. Different names have been used to describe the circulating and emerging A/H9 lineages. To address this issue, an international group of experts from animal and public health laboratories, endorsed by the WOAH/FAO Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza, has created a practical lineage classification and nomenclature system based on the analysis of 10,638 hemagglutinin sequences from A/H9 AIVs sampled worldwide. This system incorporates phylogenetic relationships and epidemiologic characteristics designed to trace emerging and circulating lineages and clades. To aid in lineage and clade assignment, an online tool has been created. This proposed classification enables rapid comprehension of the global spread and evolution of A/H9 AIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper proposes a classification and nomenclature system based on phylogenetics without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Avian influenza viruses in wild birds in Canada following incursions of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus from Eurasia in 2021-2022.
Abstract: Following the detection of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in Newfoundland, Canada, in late 2021, avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in wild birds was scaled up across Canada. Herein, we present the results of Canada's Interagency Surveillance Program for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds during the first year (November 2021-November 2022) following the incursions of HPAIV from Eurasia. The key objectives of the surveillance program were to (i) identify the presence, distribution, and spread of HPAIV and other AIVs; (ii) identify wild bird morbidity and mortality associated with HPAIV; (iii) identify the range of wild bird species infected by HPAIV; and (iv) genetically characterize detected AIV. A total of 6,246 sick and dead wild birds were tested, of which 27.4% were HPAIV positive across 12 taxonomic orders and 80 species. Geographically, HPAIV detections occurred in all Canadian provinces and territories, with the highest numbers in the Atlantic and Central Flyways. Temporally, peak detections differed across flyways, though the national peak occurred in April 2022. In an additional 11,295 asymptomatic harvested or live-captured wild birds, 5.2% were HPAIV positive across 3 taxonomic orders and 19 species. Whole-genome sequencing identified HPAIV of Eurasian origin as most prevalent in the Atlantic Flyway, along with multiple reassortants of mixed Eurasian and North American origins distributed across Canada, with moderate structuring at the flyway scale. Wild birds were victims and reservoirs of HPAIV H5N1 2.3.4.4b, underscoring the importance of surveillance encompassing samples from sick and dead, as well as live and harvested birds, to provide insights into the dynamics and potential impacts of the HPAIV H5N1 outbreak. This dramatic shift in the presence and distribution of HPAIV in wild birds in Canada highlights a need for sustained investment in wild bird surveillance and collaboration across interagency partners. We present the results of Canada's Interagency Surveillance Program for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in the year following the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 on the continent. The surveillance program tested over 17,000 wild birds, both sick and apparently healthy, which revealed spatiotemporal and taxonomic patterns in HPAIV prevalence and mortality across Canada. The significant shift in the presence and distribution of HPAIV in Canada's wild birds underscores the need for sustained investment in wild bird surveillance and collaboration across One Health partners.

Title: A small molecule compound targeting hemagglutinin inhibits influenza A virus and exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a widespread pathogen that poses a significant threat to human health, causing pandemics with high mortality and pathogenicity. Given the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains of IAV, currently available antiviral drugs have been reported to be inadequate to meet clinical demands. Therefore, continuous exploration of safe, effective and broad-spectrum antiviral medications is urgently required. Here, we found that the small molecule compound J1 exhibited low toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, J1 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including IAV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects and mechanism of action of J1 on IAV in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that J1 inhibited infection by IAV strains, including H1N1, H7N9, H5N1 and H3N2, as well as by oseltamivir-resistant strains. Mechanistic studies have shown that J1 blocks IAV infection mainly through specific interactions with the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 subunit, thereby blocking membrane fusion. BALB/c mice were used to establish a model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by IAV. Treatment with J1 increased survival rates and reduced viral titers, lung index and lung inflammatory damage in virus-infected mice. In conclusion, J1 possesses significant anti-IAV effects in vitro and in vivo, providing insights into the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against future pandemics.

Title: Red knots in Europe: a dead end host species or a new niche for highly pathogenic avian influenza?
Abstract: The 2020/2021 epidemic in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5 surpassed all previously recorded European outbreaks in size, genotype constellations and reassortment frequency and continued into 2022 and 2023. The causative 2.3.4.4b viral lineage proved to be highly proficient with respect to reassortment with cocirculating low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and seems to establish an endemic status in northern Europe. A specific HPAIV reassortant of the subtype H5N3 was detected almost exclusively in red knots (<i>Calidris canutus islandica</i>) in December 2020. It caused systemic and rapidly fatal disease leading to a singular and self-limiting mass mortality affecting about 3500 birds in the German Wadden Sea, roughly 1 % of the entire flyway population of <i>islandica</i> red knots. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the H5N3 reassortant very likely had formed in red knots and remained confined to this species. While mechanisms of virus circulation in potential reservoir species, dynamics of spill-over and reassortment events and the roles of environmental virus sources remain to be identified, the year-round infection pressure poses severe threats to endangered avian species and prompts adaptation of habitat and species conservation practices.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses epidemiology, reassortment, and phylogenetics of avian influenza in red knots but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Primary nasal influenza infection rewires tissue-scale memory response dynamics.
Abstract: The nasal mucosa is often the initial site of respiratory viral infection, replication, and transmission. Understanding how infection shapes tissue-scale primary and memory responses is critical for designing mucosal therapeutics and vaccines. We generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas of the murine nasal mucosa, sampling three regions during primary influenza infection and rechallenge. Compositional analysis revealed restricted infection to the respiratory mucosa with stepwise changes in immune and epithelial cell subsets and states. We identified and characterized a rare subset of Krt13+ nasal immune-interacting floor epithelial (KNIIFE) cells, which concurrently increased with tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>)-like cells. Proportionality analysis, cell-cell communication inference, and microscopy underscored the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis between KNIIFE and T<sub>RM</sub> cells. Secondary influenza challenge induced accelerated and coordinated myeloid and lymphoid responses without epithelial proliferation. Together, this atlas serves as a reference for viral infection in the upper respiratory tract and highlights the efficacy of local coordinated memory responses.

Title: IAVCP (Influenza A Virus Consensus and Phylogeny): Automatic Identification of the Genomic Sequence of the Influenza A Virus from High-Throughput Sequencing Data.
Abstract: Recently, high-throughput sequencing of influenza A viruses has become a routine test. It should be noted that the extremely high diversity of the influenza A virus complicates the task of determining the sequences of all eight genome segments. For a fast and accurate analysis, it is necessary to select the most suitable reference for each segment. At the same time, there is no standardized method in the field of decoding sequencing results that allows the user to update the sequence databases to which the reads obtained by virus sequencing are compared. The IAVCP (influenza A virus consensus and phylogeny) was developed with the goal of automatically analyzing high-throughput sequencing data of influenza A viruses. Its goals include the extraction of a consensus genome directly from paired raw reads. In addition, the pipeline enables the identification of potential reassortment events in the evolutionary history of the virus of interest by analyzing the topological structure of phylogenetic trees that are automatically reconstructed.

Title: Genetic diversity of H5N1 and H5N2 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in Japan during the winter of 2022-2023.
Abstract: High pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the H5N1 and H5N2 subtypes were responsible for 84 HPAI outbreaks on poultry premises in Japan during October 2022-April 2023. The number of outbreaks during the winter of 2022-2023 is the largest ever reported in Japan. In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyses using the full genetic sequences of HPAIVs isolated in Japan during 2022-2023 and those obtained from a public database to identify their genetic origin. Based on the hemagglutinin genes, these HPAIVs were classified into the G2 group of clade 2.3.4.4b, whose ancestors were H5 HPAIVs that circulated in Europe in late 2020, and were then further divided into three subgroups (G2b, G2d, and G2c). Approximately one-third of these viruses were classified into the G2b and G2d groups, which also included H5N1 HPAIVs detected in Japan during 2021-2022. In contrast, the remaining two-thirds were classified into the G2c group, which originated from H5N1 HPAIVs isolated in Asian countries and Russia during the winter of 2021-2022. Unlike the G2b and G2d viruses, the G2c viruses were first detected in Japan in the fall of 2022. Importantly, G2c viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks throughout Japan over the longest period during the season. Phylogenetic analyses using eight segment genes revealed that G2b, G2d, and G2c viruses were divided into 2, 4, and 11 genotypes, respectively, because they have various internal genes closely related to those of avian influenza viruses detected in wild birds in recent years in Asia, Russia, and North America, respectively. These results suggest that HPAIVs were disseminated among migratory birds, which may have generated numerous reassortant viruses with various gene constellations, resulting in a considerable number of outbreaks during the winter of 2022-2023.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic and genetic diversity analyses of H5N1 and H5N2 viruses without explicit discussion of phenotypic consequences of genotypes.

Title: Using an adaptive modeling framework to identify avian influenza spillover risk at the wild-domestic interface.
Abstract: The wild to domestic bird interface is an important nexus for emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Although the recent incursion of HPAI H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b into North America calls for emergency response and planning given the unprecedented scale, readily available data-driven models are lacking. Here, we provide high resolution spatial and temporal transmission risk models for the contiguous United States. Considering virus host ecology, we included weekly species-level wild waterfowl (Anatidae) abundance and endemic low pathogenic avian influenza virus prevalence metrics in combination with number of poultry farms per commodity type and relative biosecurity risks at two spatial scales: 3 km and county-level. Spillover risk varied across the annual cycle of waterfowl migration and some locations exhibited persistent risk throughout the year given higher poultry production. Validation using wild bird introduction events identified by phylogenetic analysis from 2022 to 2023 HPAI poultry outbreaks indicate strong model performance. The modular nature of our approach lends itself to building upon updated datasets under evolving conditions, testing hypothetical scenarios, or customizing results with proprietary data. This research demonstrates an adaptive approach for developing models to inform preparedness and response as novel outbreaks occur, viruses evolve, and additional data become available.

Title: Avian influenza viruses in New Zealand wild birds, with an emphasis on subtypes H5 and H7: Their distinctive epidemiology and genomic properties.
Abstract: The rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) viruses in Southeast Asia in 2004 prompted the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries to expand its avian influenza surveillance in wild birds. A total of 18,693 birds were sampled between 2004 and 2020, including migratory shorebirds (in 2004-2009), other coastal species (in 2009-2010), and resident waterfowl (in 2004-2020). No avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from cloacal or oropharyngeal samples from migratory shorebirds or resident coastal species. Two samples from red knots (Calidris canutus) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, but virus could not be isolated and no further characterization could be undertaken. In contrast, 6179 samples from 15,740 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR. Of these, 344 were positive for H5 and 51 for H7. All H5 and H7 viruses detected were of low pathogenicity confirmed by a lack of multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. Twenty H5 viruses (six different neuraminidase [NA] subtypes) and 10 H7 viruses (two different NA subtypes) were propagated and characterized genetically. From H5- or H7-negative samples that tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, 326 AIVs were isolated, representing 41 HA/NA combinations. The most frequently isolated subtypes were H4N6, H3N8, H3N2, and H10N3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of the relations between the location and year of sampling, and presence of AIV in individual waterfowl showed that the AIV risk at a given location varied from year to year. The H5 and H7 isolates both formed monophyletic HA groups. The H5 viruses were most closely related to North American lineages, whereas the H7 viruses formed a sister cluster relationship with wild bird viruses of the Eurasian and Australian lineages. Bayesian analysis indicates that the H5 and H7 viruses have circulated in resident mallards in New Zealand for some time. Correspondingly, we found limited evidence of influenza viruses in the major migratory bird populations visiting New Zealand. Findings suggest a low probability of introduction of HPAI viruses via long-distance bird migration and a unique epidemiology of AIV in New Zealand.

Title: Genetic Diversity and Detection of Respiratory Viruses Excluding SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Gabon, 2020-2021.
Abstract: Acute respiratory infections are a major global burden in resource-limited countries, including countries in Africa. Although COVID-19 has been well studied since the pandemic emerged in Gabon, Central Africa, less attention has been paid to other respiratory viral diseases, and very little data are available. Herein, we provide the first data on the genetic diversity and detection of 18 major respiratory viruses in Gabon during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 582 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from March 2020 to July 2021, which were SARS-CoV-2 negative, 156 were positive (26%) for the following viruses: enterovirus (20.3%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (4.6%), human coronavirus OC43 (1.2%), human adenovirus (0.9%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (0.5%), influenza A virus (IAV) (0.3%), and human parainfluenza viruses (0.5%). To determine the genetic diversity and transmission route of the viruses, phylogenetic analyses were performed using genome sequences of the detected viruses. The IAV strain detected in this study was genetically similar to strains isolated in the USA, whereas the hMPV strain belonging to the A2b subtype formed a cluster with Kenyan strains. This study provides the first complete genomic sequences of HRV, IAV, and hMPV detected in Gabon, and provides insight into the circulation of respiratory viruses in the country.

Title: Influenza Virus Genomic Surveillance, Arizona, USA, 2023-2024.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and are therefore monitored worldwide in the hope to reduce the burden of disease by annual updates to vaccine recommendations. We conducted genomic sequencing of 110 influenza A and 30 influenza B viruses from specimens collected between October 2023 and February 2024 in Arizona, USA. We identified mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites as well as the neuraminidase (NA) gene in our samples. We also found no unique HA and NA mutations in vaccinated yet influenza-infected individuals. Real-time genomic sequencing surveillance is important to ensure influenza vaccine effectiveness.

Title: Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Seals, St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada<sup>1</sup>.
Abstract: We describe an unusual mortality event caused by a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b involving harbor (Phoca vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus) seals in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada, in 2022. Fifteen (56%) of the seals submitted for necropsy were considered to be fatally infected by HPAI H5N1 containing fully Eurasian or Eurasian/North American genome constellations. Concurrently, presence of large numbers of bird carcasses infected with HPAI H5N1 at seal haul-out sites most likely contributed to the spillover of infection to the seals. Histologic changes included meningoencephalitis (100%), fibrinosuppurative alveolitis, and multiorgan acute necrotizing inflammation. This report of fatal HPAI H5N1 infection in pinnipeds in Canada raises concerns about the expanding host of this virus, the potential for the establishment of a marine mammal reservoir, and the public health risks associated with spillover to mammals.Nous décrivons un événement de mortalité inhabituelle causé par un virus de l'influenza aviaire hautement pathogène A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b chez des phoques communs (Phoca vitulina) et gris (Halichoerus grypus) dans l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent au Québec, Canada, en 2022. Quinze (56%) des phoques soumis pour nécropsie ont été considérés comme étant fatalement infectés par le virus H5N1 de lignées eurasiennes ou de réassortiment eurasiennes/nord-américaines. Un grand nombre simultané de carcasses d'oiseaux infectés par le H5N1 sur les sites d'échouement a probablement contribué à la contamination de ces phoques. Les changements histologiques associés à cette infection incluaient : méningo-encéphalite (100%), alvéolite fibrinosuppurée et inflammation nécrosante aiguë multi-organique.

Five representative samples from each farm were pooled and tested for H5 & H9 subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), Avian Orthoavulavirus-1 (AOAV-1), and turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) using real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. Representative tissue samples from positive cases were subjected to histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The PCR techniques confirmed the presence of AOAV-1 and H5 AIV genes, while none of the tested samples were positive for H9 or TRT. Microscopic examination of tissue samples revealed congestion and hemorrhage in the lungs, liver, and intestines with leukocytic infiltration. IHC revealed viral antigens in the lungs, liver, and intestines. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that H5 HA belonged to 2.3.4.4b H5 sublineage and AOAV-1 belonged to VII 1.1 genotype. The study highlights the need for proper monitoring of hybrid converter breeds for viral diseases, and the importance of vaccination programs to prevent unnecessary losses. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the isolation of AOAV-1 and H5Nx viruses from Hybrid Converter Turkeys in Egypt.

Title: Genetic characteristics of H1N1 influenza virus outbreak in China in early 2023.
Abstract: • H1N1 strains were collected from Hunan and Jiangsu provinces in early 2023 following the optimized COVID-19 strategy. • Phylogenic analysis revealed that the epidemic H1N1 viruses fell into different HA clades compared to vaccine strains. • Mutations on HA antigenic sites suggest antigenic drift in the epidemic H1N1 viruses versus vaccine strains. • A potential mismatch was found between recommended vaccine strains and the epidemic H1N1 viruses. • The expeditious, precise, and personalized vaccine update program for influenza virus may need to be put on the agenda.

Title: Evidence of reassortment of avian influenza A (H2) viruses in Brazilian shorebirds.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses of the H2 subtype represent a zoonotic and pandemic threat to humans due to a lack of widespread specific immunity. Although A(H2) viruses that circulate in wild bird reservoirs are distinct from the 1957 pandemic A(H2N2) viruses, there is concern that they could impact animal and public health. There is limited information on AIVs in Latin America, and next to nothing about H2 subtypes in Brazil. In the present study, we report the occurrence and genomic sequences of two influenza A viruses isolated from wild-caught white-rumped sandpipers (Calidris fuscicollis). One virus, identified as A(H2N1), was isolated from a bird captured in Restinga de Jurubatiba National Park (PNRJ, Rio de Janeiro), while the other, identified as A(H2N2), was isolated from a bird captured in Lagoa do Peixe National Park (PNLP, Rio Grande do Sul). DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences revealed that each virus belonged to distinct subtypes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genomic sequence of the A(H2N1) virus isolated from PNRJ was most closely related to other A(H2N1) viruses isolated from North American birds. On the other hand, the A(H2N2) virus genome recovered from the PNLP-captured bird exhibited a more diverse origin, with some sequences closely related to viruses from Iceland and North America, and others showing similarity to virus sequences recovered from birds in South America. Viral genes of diverse origins were identified in one of the viruses, indicating local reassortment. This suggests that the extreme South of Brazil may serve as an environment conducive to reassortment between avian influenza virus lineages from North and South America, potentially contributing to an increase in overall viral diversity.

Title: Epitopes in the HA and NA of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses that are important for antigenic drift.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses evolve antigenically to evade host immunity. Two influenza A virus surface glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are the major targets of host immunity and undergo antigenic drift in response to host pre-existing humoral and cellular immune responses. Specific sites have been identified as important epitopes in prominent subtypes such as H5 and H7, which are of animal and public health significance due to their panzootic and pandemic potential. The haemagglutinin is the immunodominant immunogen, it has been extensively studied, and the antigenic reactivity is closely monitored to ensure candidate vaccine viruses are protective. More recently, the neuraminidase has received increasing attention for its role as a protective immunogen. The neuraminidase is expressed at a lower abundance than the haemagglutinin on the virus surface but does elicit a robust antibody response. This review aims to compile the current information on haemagglutinin and neuraminidase epitopes and immune escape mutants of H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Understanding the evolution of immune escape mutants and the location of epitopes is critical for identification of vaccine strains and development of broadly reactive vaccines that can be utilized in humans and animals.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review compiling information on epitopes and immune escape mutants but does not present new explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Random-Effects Substitution Models for Phylogenetics via Scalable Gradient Approximations.
Abstract: Phylogenetic and discrete-trait evolutionary inference depend heavily on an appropriate characterization of the underlying character substitution process. In this paper, we present random-effects substitution models that extend common continuous-time Markov chain models into a richer class of processes capable of capturing a wider variety of substitution dynamics. As these random-effects substitution models often require many more parameters than their usual counterparts, inference can be both statistically and computationally challenging. Thus, we also propose an efficient approach to compute an approximation to the gradient of the data likelihood with respect to all unknown substitution model parameters. We demonstrate that this approximate gradient enables scaling of sampling-based inference, namely Bayesian inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, under random-effects substitution models across large trees and state-spaces. Applied to a dataset of 583 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, an HKY model with random-effects shows strong signals of nonreversibility in the substitution process, and posterior predictive model checks clearly show that it is a more adequate model than a reversible model. When analyzing the pattern of phylogeographic spread of 1441 influenza A virus (H3N2) sequences between 14 regions, a random-effects phylogeographic substitution model infers that air travel volume adequately predicts almost all dispersal rates. A random-effects state-dependent substitution model reveals no evidence for an effect of arboreality on the swimming mode in the tree frog subfamily Hylinae. Simulations reveal that random-effects substitution models can accommodate both negligible and radical departures from the underlying base substitution model. We show that our gradient-based inference approach is over an order of magnitude more time efficient than conventional approaches.

Title: Iceland: an underestimated hub for the spread of high-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in the North Atlantic.
Abstract: High-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the goose/Guangdong lineage are enzootically circulating in wild bird populations worldwide. This increases the risk of entry into poultry production and spill-over to mammalian species, including humans. Better understanding of the ecological and epizootiological networks of these viruses is essential to optimize mitigation measures. Based on full genome sequences of 26 HPAIV samples from Iceland, which were collected between spring and autumn 2022, as well as 1 sample from the 2023 summer period, we show that 3 different genotypes of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b were circulating within the wild bird population in Iceland in 2022. Furthermore, in 2023 we observed a novel introduction of HPAIV H5N5 of the same clade to Iceland. The data support the role of Iceland as an utmost northwestern distribution area in Europe that might act also as a potential bridging point for intercontinental spread of HPAIV across the North Atlantic.

Title: Detection and Characterization of Influenza A Virus Endemic Circulation in Suckling and Nursery Pigs Originating from Vaccinated Farms in the Same Production System.
Abstract: Inactivated influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines help reduce clinical disease in suckling piglets, although endemic infections still exist. The objective of this study was to evaluate the detection of IAV in suckling and nursery piglets from IAV-vaccinated sows from farms with endemic IAV infections. Eight nasal swab collections were obtained from 135 two-week-old suckling piglets from four farms every other week from March to September 2013. Oral fluid samples were collected from the same group of nursery piglets. IAV RNA was detected in 1.64% and 31.01% of individual nasal swabs and oral fluids, respectively. H1N2 was detected most often, with sporadic detection of H1N1 and H3N2. Whole-genome sequences of IAV isolated from suckling piglets revealed an H1 hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1B.2.2.2 clade and N2 neuraminidase (NA) from the 2002A clade. The internal gene constellation of the endemic H1N2 was TTTTPT with a pandemic lineage matrix. The HA gene had 97.59% and 97.52% nucleotide and amino acid identities, respectively, to the H1 1B.2.2.2 used in the farm-specific vaccine. A similar H1 1B.2.2.2 was detected in the downstream nursery. These data demonstrate the low frequency of IAV detection in suckling piglets and downstream nurseries from farms with endemic infections in spite of using farm-specific IAV vaccines in sows.

Title: Avian Influenza Virus and Avian Paramyxoviruses in Wild Waterfowl of the Western Coast of the Caspian Sea (2017-2020).
Abstract: The flyways of many different wild waterfowl pass through the Caspian Sea region. The western coast of the middle Caspian Sea is an area with many wetlands, where wintering grounds with large concentrations of birds are located. It is known that wild waterfowl are a natural reservoir of the influenza A virus. In the mid-2000s, in the north of this region, the mass deaths of swans, gulls, and pelicans from high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) were noted. At present, there is still little known about the presence of avian influenza virus (AIVs) and different avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) in the region's waterfowl bird populations. Here, we report the results of monitoring these viruses in the wild waterfowl of the western coast of the middle Caspian Sea from 2017 to 2020. Samples from 1438 individuals of 26 bird species of 7 orders were collected, from which 21 strains of AIV were isolated, amounting to a 1.46% isolation rate of the total number of samples analyzed (none of these birds exhibited external signs of disease). The following subtypes were determined and whole-genome nucleotide sequences of the isolated strains were obtained: H1N1 (<i>n</i> = 2), H3N8 (<i>n</i> = 8), H4N6 (<i>n</i> = 2), H7N3 (<i>n</i> = 2), H8N4 (<i>n</i> = 1), H10N5 (<i>n</i> = 1), and H12N5 (<i>n</i> = 1). No high pathogenicity influenza virus H5 subtype was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of AIV genomes did not reveal any specific pattern for viruses in the Caspian Sea region, showing that all segments belong to the Eurasian clades of classic avian-like influenza viruses. We also did not find the amino acid substitutions in the polymerase complex (PA, PB1, and PB2) that are critical for the increase in virulence or adaptation to mammals. In total, 23 hemagglutinating viruses not related to influenza A virus were also isolated, of which 15 belonged to avian paramyxoviruses. We were able to sequence 12 avian paramyxoviruses of three species, as follows: Newcastle disease virus (<i>n</i> = 4); Avian paramyxovirus 4 (<i>n</i> = 5); and Avian paramyxovirus 6 (<i>n</i> = 3). In the Russian Federation, the Newcastle disease virus of the VII.1.1 sub-genotype was first isolated from a wild bird (common pheasant) in the Caspian Sea region. The five avian paramyxovirus 4 isolates obtained belonged to the common clade in Genotype I, whereas phylogenetic analysis of three isolates of Avian paramyxovirus 6 showed that two isolates, isolated in 2017, belonged to Genotype I and that an isolate identified in 2020 belonged to Genotype II. The continued regular monitoring of AIVs and APMVs, the obtaining of data on the biological properties of isolated strains, and the accumulation of information on virus host species will allow for the adequate planning of epidemiological measures, suggest the most likely routes of spread of the virus, and assist in the prediction of the introduction of the viruses in the western coastal region of the middle Caspian Sea.

Title: Abundant Intra-Subtype Reassortment Revealed in H13N8 Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a serious threat to global health. On the one hand, these viruses cause seasonal flu outbreaks in humans. On the other hand, they are a zoonotic infection that has the potential to cause a pandemic. The most important natural reservoir of IAVs are waterfowl. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of IAV in birds in the Republic of Buryatia (region in Russia). In 2020, a total of 3018 fecal samples were collected from wild migratory birds near Lake Baikal. Of these samples, 11 were found to be positive for the H13N8 subtype and whole-genome sequencing was performed on them. All samples contained the same virus with the designation A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020. To our knowledge, virus A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 is the first representative of the H13N8 subtype collected on the territory of Russia, the sequence of which is available in the GenBank database. An analysis of reassortments based on the genome sequences of other known viruses has shown that A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 arose as a result of reassortment. In addition, a reassortment most likely occurred several decades ago between the ancestors of the viruses recently collected in China, the Netherlands, the United States and Chile. The presence of such reassortment emphasizes the ongoing evolution of the H13N8 viruses distributed in Europe, North and East Asia, North and South America and Australia. This study underscores the importance of the continued surveillance and research of less-studied influenza subtypes.

Title: Molecular Characterization of Non-H5 and Non-H7 Avian Influenza Viruses from Non-Mallard Migratory Waterbirds of the North American Flyways, 2006-2011.
Abstract: The surveillance of migratory waterbirds (MWs) for avian influenza virus (AIV) is indispensable for the early detection of a potential AIV incursion into poultry. Surveying AIV infections and virus subtypes in understudied MW species could elucidate their role in AIV ecology. Oropharyngeal-cloacal (OPC) swabs were collected from non-mallard MWs between 2006 and 2011. OPC swabs (<i>n</i> = 1158) that molecularly tested positive for AIV (Cts ≤ 32) but tested negative for H5 and H7 subtypes were selected for virus isolation (VI). The selected samples evenly represented birds from all four North American flyways (Pacific, Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic). Eighty-seven low pathogenic AIV isolates, representing 31 sites in 17 states, were recovered from the samples. All isolates belonged to the North American lineage. The samples representing birds from the Central Flyway had the highest VI positive rate (57.5%) compared to those from the other flyways (10.3-17.2%), suggesting that future surveillance can focus on the Central Flyway. Of the isolates, 43.7%, 12.6%, and 10.3% were obtained from blue-winged teal, American wigeon, and American black duck species, respectively. Hatch-year MWs represented the majority of the isolates (70.1%). The most common H and N combinations were H3N8 (23.0%), H4N6 (18.4%), and H4N8 (18.4%). The HA gene between non-mallard and mallard MW isolates during the same time period shared 85.5-99.5% H3 identity and 89.3-99.7% H4 identity. Comparisons between MW (mallard and non-mallard) and poultry H3 and H4 isolates also revealed high similarity (79.0-99.0% and 88.7-98.4%), emphasizing the need for continued AIV surveillance in MWs.

Title: Isolation and genetic characterization of multiple genotypes of both H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses from environmental water in the Izumi plain, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan during the 2021/22 winter season.
Abstract: In the 2021/22 winter, one H5N1 and nine H5N8 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of clade 2.3.3.4b were isolated from the water in crane roosts on the Izumi plain, Japan. Additionally, we isolated low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) of five subtypes: H1N1, H4N2, H4N6, H7N7, and H10N4. H5N8 HPAIVs belonging to the G2a group were isolated throughout winter, whereas H5N1 HPAIV belonging to the G2b group were isolated only in early winter. These findings suggest co-circulation of both G2a and G2b HPAIVs in early winter. Although two H7N7 LPAIVs were isolated from cranes' roost water collected on the same day, the gene constellations of the two isolates were clearly different, indicating the contemporary invasion of at least two different genotypes of H7N7 LPAIVs in the Izumi plain. This study underscores the importance of monitoring both HPAIVs and LPAIVs to understand avian influenza virus ecology in migratory waterfowl populations.

Title: Real-time investigation of an influenza A(H3N2) virus outbreak in a refugee community, November 2022.
Abstract: To report epidemiological and virological results of an outbreak investigation of influenza-like illness (ILI) among refugees in Northern Italy. Outbreak investigation of ILI cases observed among nearly 100 refugees in Northern Italy unvaccinated for influenza. An epidemiological investigation matched with a differential diagnosis was carried out for each sample collected from ILI cases to identify 10 viral pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and adenovirus) by using specific real-time PCR assays according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocols. In cases where the influenza virus type was identified, complete hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequencing and the related phylogenetic analysis were conducted. The outbreak was caused by influenza A(H3N2): the attack rate was 83.3% in children aged 9-14 years, 84.6% in those aged 15-24 years, and 28.6% in adults ≥25 years. Phylogenetic analyses uncovered that A(H3N2) strains were closely related since they segregated in the same cluster, showing both a high mean nucleotide identity (100%), all belonging to the genetic sub-group 3C.2a1b.2a.2, as those mainly circulating into the general population in the same period. The fact that influenza outbreak strains as well as the community strains were genetically related to the seasonal vaccine strain suggests that if an influenza prevention by vaccination strategy had been implemented, a lower attack rate of A(H3N2) and ILI cases might have been achieved.

Title: Genetics of H5N1 and H5N8 High-Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated in Japan in Winter 2021-2022.
Abstract: In winter 2021-2022, H5N1 and H5N8 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (HPAIVs) caused serious outbreaks in Japan: 25 outbreaks of HPAI at poultry farms and 107 cases in wild birds or in the environment. Phylogenetic analyses divided H5 HPAIVs isolated in Japan in the winter of 2021-2022 into three groups-G2a, G2b, and G2d-which were disseminated at different locations and times. Full-genome sequencing analyses of these HPAIVs revealed a strong relationship of multiple genes between Japan and Siberia, suggesting that they arose from reassortment events with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in Siberia. The results emphasize the complex of dissemination and reassortment events with the movement of migratory birds, and the importance of continual monitoring of AIVs in Japan and Siberia for early alerts to the intrusion of HPAIVs.

Title: Changing and Evolution of Influenza Virus: Is It a Trivial Flu?
Abstract: Influenza viruses are etiological agents which cause contagious respiratory, seasonal epidemics and, for influenza A subtypes, pandemics. The clinical picture of influenza has undergone continuous change over the years, due to intrinsic viral evolution as well as "reassortment" of its genomic segments. The history of influenza highlights its ability to adapt and to rapidly evolve, without specific circumstances. This reflects the complexity of this pathology and poses the fundamental question about its assumption as a "common illness" and its impact on public health. The global influenza epidemics and pandemics claimed millions of deaths, leaving an indelible mark on public health and showing the need for a better comprehension of the influenza virus. The clear understanding of genetic variations during the influenza seasonal epidemics is a crucial point for developing effective strategies for prevention, treatment, and vaccine design. The recent advance in next-generation sequencing approaches, model systems to virus culture, and bioinformatics pipeline played a key role in the rapid characterization of circulating influenza strains. In particular, the increase in computational power allowed the performance of complex tasks in healthcare settings through machine learning algorithms, which analyze different variables, such as medical and laboratory outputs, to optimize medical research and improve public health systems. The early detection of emerging and reemerging pathogens is a matter of importance to prevent future pandemics. The perception of influenza as a "trivial flu" or a more serious public health concern is a subject of ongoing debate, reflecting the multifaceted nature of this infectious disease. The variability in the severity of influenza sheds light on the unpredictability of the viral characteristics, coupled with the challenges in accurately predicting circulating strains. This adds complexity to the public health burden of influenza and highlights the need for targeted interventions.

Title: Synchrony of Bird Migration with Global Dispersal of Avian Influenza Reveals Exposed Bird Orders.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A H5, particularly clade 2.3.4.4, has caused worldwide outbreaks in domestic poultry, occasional spillover to humans, and increasing deaths of diverse species of wild birds since 2014. Wild bird migration is currently acknowledged as an important ecological process contributing to the global dispersal of HPAIV H5. However, this mechanism has not been quantified using bird movement data from different species, and the timing and location of exposure of different species is unclear. We sought to explore these questions through phylodynamic analyses based on empirical data of bird movement tracking and virus genome sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1. First, we demonstrate that seasonal bird migration can explain salient features of the global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4. Second, we detect synchrony between the seasonality of bird annual cycle phases and virus lineage movements. We reveal the differing exposed bird orders at geographical origins and destinations of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage movements, including relatively under-discussed orders. Our study provides a phylodynamic framework that links the bird movement ecology and genomic epidemiology of avian influenza; it highlights the importance of integrating bird behavior and life history in avian influenza studies.

Title: An amplicon-based nanopore sequencing workflow for rapid tracking of avian influenza outbreaks, France, 2020-2022.
Abstract: During the recent avian influenza epizootics that occurred in France in 2020/21 and 2021/22, the virus was so contagiousness that it was impossible to control its spread between farms. The preventive slaughter of millions of birds consequently was the only solution available. In an effort to better understand the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in a rapid and innovative manner, we established an amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow for the rapid genetic typing of circulating AIV strains. An amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow based on a set of PCR primers targeting primarily the hemagglutinin gene but also the entire influenza virus genome was developed. Thirty field samples from H5 HPAIV outbreaks in France, including environmental samples, were sequenced using the MinION MK1C. A real-time alignment of the sequences with MinKNOW software allowed the sequencing run to be stopped as soon as enough data were generated. The consensus sequences were then generated and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish links between the outbreaks. The whole sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was obtained for the 30 clinical samples of H5Nx HPAIV belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b. The consensus sequences comparison and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated links between some outbreaks. While several studies have shown the advantages of MinION for avian influenza virus sequencing, this workflow has been applied exclusively to clinical field samples, without any amplification step on cell cultures or embryonated eggs. As this type of testing pipeline requires only a short amount of time to link outbreaks or demonstrate a new introduction, it could be applied to the real-time management of viral epizootics.

Reason: The paper describes a sequencing workflow for rapid genetic typing and outbreak tracking but does not explicitly analyze links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Targeted genomic sequencing of avian influenza viruses in wetland sediment from wild bird habitats.
Abstract: Diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in wild birds, including highly pathogenic strains that infect poultry and humans. Consequently, surveillance of IAVs in wild birds is a cornerstone of agricultural biosecurity and pandemic preparedness. Surveillance is traditionally done by testing wild birds directly, but obtaining these specimens is labor intensive, detection rates can be low, and sampling is often biased toward certain avian species. As a result, local incursions of dangerous IAVs are rarely detected before outbreaks begin. Testing environmental specimens from wild bird habitats has been proposed as an alternative surveillance strategy. These specimens are thought to contain diverse IAVs deposited by a broad range of avian hosts, including species that are not typically sampled by surveillance programs. To enable this surveillance strategy, we developed a targeted genomic sequencing method for characterizing IAVs in these challenging environmental specimens. It combines custom hybridization probes, unique molecular index-based library construction, and purpose-built bioinformatic tools, allowing IAV genomic material to be enriched and analyzed with single-fragment resolution. We demonstrated our method on 90 sediment specimens from wetlands around Vancouver, Canada. We recovered 2,312 IAV genome fragments originating from all eight IAV genome segments. Eleven hemagglutinin subtypes and nine neuraminidase subtypes were detected, including H5, the current global surveillance priority. Our results demonstrate that targeted genomic sequencing of environmental specimens from wild bird habitats could become a valuable complement to avian influenza surveillance programs.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we developed genome sequencing tools for characterizing avian influenza viruses in sediment from wild bird habitats. These tools enable an environment-based approach to avian influenza surveillance. This could improve early detection of dangerous strains in local wild birds, allowing poultry producers to better protect their flocks and prevent human exposures to potential pandemic threats. Furthermore, we purposefully developed these methods to contend with viral genomic material that is diluted, fragmented, incomplete, and derived from multiple strains and hosts. These challenges are common to many environmental specimens, making these methods broadly applicable for genomic pathogen surveillance in diverse contexts.

Title: Active surveillance for influenza virus and coronavirus infection in Antarctic birds and mammals in environmental fecal samples, South Shetland Islands.
Abstract: Numerous Antarctic species are recognized as reservoirs for various pathogens, and their migratory behavior allows them to reach the Brazilian coast, potentially contributing to the emergence and circulation of new infectious diseases. To address the potential zoonotic risks, we conducted surveillance of influenza A virus (IAV) and coronaviruses (CoVs) in the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically focusing on different bird and mammal species in the region. During the summer of 2021/2022, as part of the Brazilian Antarctic Expedition, we collected and examined a total of 315 fecal samples to target these respiratory viruses. Although we did not detect the viruses of interest during this particular expedition, previous research conducted by our team has shown the presence of the H11N2 subtype of influenza A virus in penguin fecal samples from the same region. Given the continuous emergence of new viral strains worldwide, it is crucial to maintain active surveillance in the area, contributing to strengthening integrated One Health surveillance efforts.

A prerequisite for this vaccination is the implementation of drastic surveillance protocols. Environmental sampling is a relevant alternative to animal sampling. However, environmental samples often contain inhibitory compounds in large enough quantities to inhibit RT-qPCR reactions. As bovine serum albumin is a molecule used in many fields to overcome this inhibitory effect, we tested its use on dust samples from poultry farms in areas heavily affected by HPAIV epizootics. Our results show that its use significantly increases the sensitivity of the method.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on improving RT-qPCR sensitivity for virus detection in environmental samples and does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Sequencing methods for HA and NA genes of avian influenza viruses from wild bird feces using Oxford Nanopore sequencing.
Abstract: We developed a method to determine the sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from RNA extracted directly from wild bird fecal samples, using Nanopore Flongle. We determined the nucleotide sequences and subtypes of HA and NA in 16 and 15 samples respectively, using Flongle. The results of HA and NA subtyping determined by the conventional method were consistent with their subtypes determined by our method, thereby the applicability of this method in the identification of HA and NA subtypes. In addition, the homology between the HA fragments in this and the Sanger methods ranged from 98.5 % to 100 %. Compared with conventional PCR with the Sanger method, this method can easily determine HA and NA subtypes and sequences directly from the fecal samples. It is easier to implement and has lower running costs (USD100$) than other NGS-based methods, making it a useful tool for avian influenza surveillance in wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes a sequencing method for HA and NA genes from fecal samples but does not analyze links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Predominance of low pathogenic avian influenza virus H9N2 in the respiratory co-infections in broilers in Tunisia: a longitudinal field study, 2018-2020.
Abstract: Respiratory diseases are a health and economic concern for poultry production worldwide. Given global economic exchanges and migratory bird flyways, respiratory viruses are likely to emerge continuously in new territories. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the major pathogens involved in respiratory disease in Tunisian broiler poultry and their epidemiology. Between 2018 and 2020, broilers farms in northeastern Tunisia were monitored, and 39 clinically diseased flocks were sampled. Samples were screened for five viral and three bacterial respiratory pathogens using a panel of real-time PCR assays. The reemergence of H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in commercial poultry was reported, and the Northern and Western African GI lineage strain was typed. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) GI-23 lineage and the avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) subtype B also were detected for the first time in broilers in Tunisia. H9N2 LPAIV was the most detected pathogen in the flocks tested, but rarely alone, as 15 of the 16 H9N2 positive flocks were co-infected. Except for infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), all of the targeted pathogens were detected, and in 61% of the respiratory disease cases, a combination of pathogens was identified. The major combinations were H9N2 + aMPV (8/39) and H9N2 + IBV (6/39), showing the high contribution of H9N2 LPAIV to the multifactorial respiratory diseases. This field survey provided evidence of the emergence of new respiratory viruses and the complexity of respiratory disease in Tunisia. A comprehensive and continuous surveillance strategy therefore is needed to better control respiratory pathogens in Tunisia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiology and detection of viral pathogens and co-infections but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza: Searching for Pandemic Origins.
Abstract: From a farming family of 13 children in New Zealand, I graduated with a Master of Science degree in microbiology from the University of Otago (Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand). I established the first veterinary virology laboratory at Wallaceville Animal Research Station. I subsequently completed my PhD degree at Australian National University (Canberra, Australia) and a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan). While in New South Wales, Australia, a walk on a beach littered with dead mutton birds (shearwaters) with Dr. Graeme Laver led to the surveillance of influenza in seabirds on the Great Barrier Reef Islands and my lifelong search for the origin of pandemic influenza viruses. Subsequent studies established that (<i>a</i>) aquatic birds are a natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, (<i>b</i>) these viruses replicate primarily in cells lining the intestinal tract, (<i>c</i>) reassortment in nature can lead to novel pandemic influenza viruses, and (<i>d</i>) live bird markets are one place where transmission of influenza virus from animals to humans occurs.

Title: Mass mortality event in South American sea lions (<i>Otaria flavescens</i>) correlated to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in Chile.
Abstract: In Chile, since January 2023, a sudden and pronounced increase in strandings and mortality has been observed among South American (SA) sea lions (Otaria flavescens), prompting significant concern. Simultaneously, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1) in avian species has emerged since December 2022. To investigate the cause of this unexpected mortality, we conducted a comprehensive epidemiological and pathologic study. One hundred sixty-nine SA sea lions were sampled to ascertain their HPAIV H5N1 status, and long-term stranding trends from 2009 to 2023 were analyzed. In addition, two animals were necropsied. Remarkably, a significant surge in SA sea lion strandings was observed initiating in January 2023 and peaking in June 2023, with a count of 4,545 stranded and deceased animals. Notably, this surge in mortality correlates geographically with HPAIV outbreaks affecting wild birds. Among 168 sampled SA sea lions, 34 (20%) tested positive for Influenza A virus, and 21 confirmed for HPAIV H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade in tracheal/rectal swab pools. Clinical and pathological evaluations of the two necropsied stranded sea lions revealed prevalent neurological and respiratory signs, including disorientation, tremors, ataxia, and paralysis, as well as acute dyspnea, tachypnea, profuse nasal secretion, and abdominal breathing. The lesions identified in necropsied animals aligned with observed clinical signs. Detection of the virus <i>via</i> immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR in the brain and lungs affirmed the findings. The findings provide evidence between the mass mortality occurrences in SA sea lions and HPAIV, strongly indicating a causal relationship. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study correlates mass mortality with HPAI H5N1 outbreak and describes pathology and epidemiology but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The re-emergence of influenza following the COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria, Australia, 2021 to 2022.
Abstract: BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, limited global circulation of influenza viruses. In Australia, travel bans for non-residents and quarantine requirements for returned travellers were eased in November 2021, providing pathways for influenza viruses to be re-introduced.AimWe aimed to describe the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the re-emergence of influenza in Victoria, Australia to inform public health interventions.MethodsFrom 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2022, we conducted an epidemiological study analysing case notification data from the Victorian Department of Health to describe case demographics, interviewed the first 200 cases to establish probable routes of virus reintroduction and examined phylogenetic and antigenic data to understand virus diversity and susceptibility to current vaccines.ResultsOverall, 1,598 notifications and 1,064 positive specimens were analysed. The majority of cases (61.4%) occurred in the 15-34 years age group. Interviews revealed a higher incidence of international travel exposure during the first month of case detections, and high levels of transmission in university residential colleges were associated with return to campus. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype, with a single lineage predominating despite multiple importations.ConclusionEnhanced testing for respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a more complete picture of influenza virus transmission compared with previous seasons. Returned international travellers were important drivers of influenza reemergence, as were young adults, a group whose role has previously been under-recognised in the establishment of seasonal influenza epidemics. Targeting interventions, including vaccination, to these groups could reduce future influenza transmission.

Title: Accelerating Bayesian inference of dependency between mixed-type biological traits.
Abstract: Inferring dependencies between mixed-type biological traits while accounting for evolutionary relationships between specimens is of great scientific interest yet remains infeasible when trait and specimen counts grow large. The state-of-the-art approach uses a phylogenetic multivariate probit model to accommodate binary and continuous traits via a latent variable framework, and utilizes an efficient bouncy particle sampler (BPS) to tackle the computational bottleneck-integrating many latent variables from a high-dimensional truncated normal distribution. This approach breaks down as the number of specimens grows and fails to reliably characterize conditional dependencies between traits. Here, we propose an inference pipeline for phylogenetic probit models that greatly outperforms BPS. The novelty lies in 1) a combination of the recent Zigzag Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Zigzag-HMC) with linear-time gradient evaluations and 2) a joint sampling scheme for highly correlated latent variables and correlation matrix elements. In an application exploring HIV-1 evolution from 535 viruses, the inference requires joint sampling from an 11,235-dimensional truncated normal and a 24-dimensional covariance matrix. Our method yields a 5-fold speedup compared to BPS and makes it possible to learn partial correlations between candidate viral mutations and virulence. Computational speedup now enables us to tackle even larger problems: we study the evolution of influenza H1N1 glycosylations on around 900 viruses. For broader applicability, we extend the phylogenetic probit model to incorporate categorical traits, and demonstrate its use to study Aquilegia flower and pollinator co-evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methodological paper on Bayesian inference for biological traits, with an application to viral evolution, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylodynamic approaches to studying avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses can cause severe disease in domestic and wild birds and are a pandemic threat. Phylodynamics is the study of how epidemiological, evolutionary, and immunological processes can interact to shape viral phylogenies. This review summarizes how phylodynamic methods have and could contribute to the study of avian influenza viruses. Specifically, we assess how phylodynamics can be used to examine viral spread within and between wild or domestic bird populations at various geographical scales, identify factors associated with virus dispersal, and determine the order and timing of virus lineage movement between geographic regions or poultry production systems. We discuss factors that can complicate the interpretation of phylodynamic results and identify how future methodological developments could contribute to improved control of the virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of phylodynamic methods applied to avian influenza virus spread and evolution, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The genomic landscape of swine influenza A viruses in Southeast Asia.
Abstract: Swine are a primary source for the emergence of pandemic influenza A viruses. The intensification of swine production, along with global trade, has amplified the transmission and zoonotic risk of swine influenza A virus (swIAV). Effective surveillance is essential to uncover emerging virus strains; however gaps remain in our understanding of the swIAV genomic landscape in Southeast Asia. More than 4,000 nasal swabs were collected from pigs in Cambodia, yielding 72 IAV-positive samples by RT-qPCR and 45 genomic sequences. We unmasked the cocirculation of multiple lineages of genetically diverse swIAV of pandemic concern. Genomic analyses revealed a novel European avian-like H1N2 swIAV reassortant variant with North American triple reassortant internal genes, that emerged approximately seven years before its first detection in pigs in 2021. Using phylogeographic reconstruction, we identified south central China as the dominant source of swine viruses disseminated to other regions in China and Southeast Asia. We also identified nine distinct swIAV lineages in Cambodia, which diverged from their closest ancestors between two and 15 B.P., indicating significant undetected diversity in the region, including reverse zoonoses of human H1N1/2009 pandemic and H3N2 viruses. A similar period of cryptic circulation of swIAVs occurred in the decades before the H1N1/2009 pandemic. The hidden diversity of swIAV observed here further emphasizes the complex underlying evolutionary processes present in this region, reinforcing the importance of genomic surveillance at the human-swine interface for early warning of disease emergence to avoid future pandemics.

Abstract: The H6 subtype of avian influenza virus (H6 AIV) is the most detected AIV subtype in poultry and wild birds. It causes economic losses to the poultry industry, and the most important, H6 AIV may have the ability to infect mammals, which is a great threat to public health security. In addition, the H6 subtype can serve as a precursor to providing internal genes for other highly pathogenic AIVs, posing a potential threat. H6 AIV currently face to the high positive detection rate and harmless nature of H6 AIV and because not highly effective H6 subtype vaccine available on the market. In this study, we focused on the prevalence of H6 AIV in poultry and wild birds, phylogenetic analysis, genetic variation characteristics, selection analysis, and prevention and control to provide relevant references for the scientific prevention and control of H6 AIV in future.

Title: Emergence of swine influenza A virus, porcine respirovirus 1 and swine orthopneumovirus in porcine respiratory disease in Germany.
Abstract: Respiratory disease is a significant economic issue in pig farming, with a complex aetiology that includes swine influenza A viruses (swIAV), which are common in European domestic pig populations. The most recent human influenza pandemic in 2009 showed swIAV's zoonotic potential. Monitoring pathogens and disease control are critical from a preventive standpoint, and are based on quick, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays capable of detecting and distinguishing currently circulating swIAV in clinical samples. For passive surveillance, a set of multiplex quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCRs (mRT-qPCR) and MinION-directed sequencing was updated and deployed. Several lineages and genotypes of swIAV were shown to be dynamically developing, including novel reassortants between human pandemic H1N1 and the avian-derived H1 lineage of swIAV. Despite this, nearly 70% (842/1216) of individual samples from pigs with respiratory symptoms were swIAV-negative, hinting to different aetiologies. The complex and synergistic interactions of swIAV infections with other viral and bacterial infectious agents contribute to the aggravation of pig respiratory diseases. Using a newly developed mRT-qPCR for the combined detection of swIAV and the recently described porcine respirovirus 1 (PRV1) and swine orthopneumovirus (SOV) widespread co-circulation of PRV1 (19.6%, 238/1216 samples) and SOV (14.2%, 173/1216 samples) was evident. Because of the high incidence of PRV1 and SOV infections in pigs with respiratory disease, these viruses may emerge as new allies in the porcine respiratory disease syndrome.

Title: Influenza transmission during COVID-19 measures downscaling in Greece, August 2022: evidence for the need of continuous integrated surveillance of respiratory viruses.
Abstract: After the near absence of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased activity of mainly influenza A(H3N2) was detected at the beginning of August 2022 in Greece on three islands. Of 33 cases with respiratory symptoms testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests, 24 were positive for influenza: 20 as A(H3N2) subtype and four as A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of selected samples from both subtypes was performed and they fell into clusters within subclades that included the 2022/23 vaccine strains. Our data suggest that influenza can be transmitted even in the presence of another highly infectious pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, with a similar transmission mode. We highlight the need for implementing changes in the current influenza surveillance and suggest a move from seasonal to continuous surveillance, especially in areas with a high number of tourists. Year-round surveillance would allow for a timelier start of vaccination campaigns and antiviral drugs procurement processes.

Title: Decoding the Fundamental Drivers of Phylodynamic Inference.
Abstract: Despite its increasing role in the understanding of infectious disease transmission at the applied and theoretical levels, phylodynamics lacks a well-defined notion of ideal data and optimal sampling. We introduce a method to visualize and quantify the relative impact of pathogen genome sequence and sampling times-two fundamental sources of data for phylodynamics under birth-death-sampling models-to understand how each drives phylodynamic inference. Applying our method to simulated data and real-world SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 Influenza data, we use this insight to elucidate fundamental trade-offs and guidelines for phylodynamic analyses to draw the most from sequence data. Phylodynamics promises to be a staple of future responses to infectious disease threats globally. Continuing research into the inherent requirements and trade-offs of phylodynamic data and inference will help ensure phylodynamic tools are wielded in ever more targeted and efficient ways.

Title: Risk factors for infection with influenza A(H3N2) virus on a US university campus, October-November 2021.
Abstract: Knowledge of the specific dynamics of influenza introduction and spread in university settings is limited. Persons with acute respiratory illness symptoms received influenza testing by molecular assay during October 6-November 23, 2022. Viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted on nasal swab samples from case-patients. Case-control analysis of a voluntary survey of persons tested was used to identify factors associated with influenza; logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios and 95% CIs. A subset of case-patients tested during the first month of the outbreak was interviewed to identify sources of introduction and early spread. Among 3268 persons tested, 788 (24.1%) tested positive for influenza; 744 (22.8%) were included in the survey analysis. All 380 sequenced specimens were influenza A (H3N2) virus clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, suggesting rapid transmission. Influenza (OR [95% CI]) was associated with indoor congregate dining (1.43 [1.002-2.03]), attending large gatherings indoors (1.83 [1.26-2.66]) or outdoors (2.33 [1.64-3.31]), and varied by residence type (apartment with ≥1 roommate: 2.93 [1.21-7.11], residence hall room alone: 4.18 [1.31-13.31], or with roommate: 6.09 [2.46-15.06], or fraternity/sorority house: 15.13 [4.30-53.21], all compared with single-dwelling apartment). Odds of influenza were lower among persons who left campus for ≥1 day during the week before their influenza test (0.49 [0.32-0.75]). Almost all early cases reported attending large events. Congregate living and activity settings on university campuses can lead to rapid spread of influenza following introduction. Isolating following a positive influenza test or administering antiviral medications to exposed persons may help mitigate outbreaks.

Title: PARNAS: Objectively Selecting the Most Representative Taxa on a Phylogeny.
Abstract: The use of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled phylogenetic studies with hundreds of thousands of taxa. Such large-scale phylogenies have become a critical component in genomic epidemiology in pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. However, detailed phenotypic characterization of pathogens or generating a computationally tractable dataset for detailed phylogenetic analyses requires objective subsampling of taxa. To address this need, we propose parnas, an objective and flexible algorithm to sample and select taxa that best represent observed diversity by solving a generalized k-medoids problem on a phylogenetic tree. parnas solves this problem efficiently and exactly by novel optimizations and adapting algorithms from operations research. For more nuanced selections, taxa can be weighted with metadata or genetic sequence parameters, and the pool of potential representatives can be user-constrained. Motivated by influenza A virus genomic surveillance and vaccine design, parnas can be applied to identify representative taxa that optimally cover the diversity in a phylogeny within a specified distance radius. We demonstrated that parnas is more efficient and flexible than existing approaches. To demonstrate its utility, we applied parnas to 1) quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity over time, 2) select representative influenza A virus in swine genes derived from over 5 years of genomic surveillance data, and 3) identify gaps in H3N2 human influenza A virus vaccine coverage. We suggest that our method, through the objective selection of representatives in a phylogeny, provides criteria for quantifying genetic diversity that has application in the the rational design of multivalent vaccines and genomic epidemiology.

Title: Spatial genetic structure of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza established as a result of interaction with human populations in mainland China.
Abstract: Identifying the spatial patterns of genetic structure of influenza A viruses is a key factor for understanding their spread and evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we used phylogenetic and Bayesian clustering analyses of genetic sequences of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus with district-level locations in mainland China to investigate the spatial genetic structure of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus across human population landscapes. Positive correlation between geographic and genetic distances indicates high degrees of genetic similarity among viruses within small geographic regions but broad-scale genetic differentiation, implying that local viral circulation was a more important driver in the formation of the spatial genetic structure of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus than even, countrywide viral mixing and gene flow. Geographic heterogeneity in the distribution of genetic subpopulations of A/H1N1pdm09 virus in mainland China indicates both local to local transmission as well as broad-range viral migration. This combination of both local and global structure suggests that both small-scale and large-scale population circulation in China is responsible for viral genetic structure. Our study provides implications for understanding the evolution and spread of A/H1N1pdm09 virus across the population landscape of mainland China, which can inform disease control strategies for future pandemics.

Title: Introduction of Multiple Novel High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (H5N1) Virus of Clade 2.3.4.4b into South Korea in 2022.
Abstract: Since October 2020, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have spread to many countries. Although these viruses evolved from Eurasian ancestors, reassortant with other LPAI viruses has generated various genotypes. Here, we identified three H5N1 HPAI viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b; these viruses were isolated from mandarin duck, common teal, and domestic breeder ducks in October 2022 during an avian influenza (AI) active surveillance program. Two of the H5N1 viruses (MD/WA496 and BD/H493) have been found sporadically in China, Russia, and Korea. It is presumed that two viruses with a similar gene constellation isolated in Russia, China, and Korea were introduced into the breeding area during the spring migration, and were introduced newly to Korea during the autumn migration. Due to international bird migration, the other virus (CT/WA537) is most similar (99.3-99.8%) to a virus detected in North Dakota, USA in April 2022. These results suggest that H5N1 viruses with at least two genotypes were introduced at the same time into Korea during the autumn of 2022, and that they originated from Eurasian breeding grounds and North America. Thus, multiple 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses were introduced into Korea during the autumn season of 2022.

Title: Phylogenomic analysis uncovers a 9-year variation of Uganda influenza type-A strains from the WHO-recommended vaccines and other Africa strains.
Abstract: Genetic characterisation of circulating influenza viruses directs annual vaccine strain selection and mitigation of infection spread. We used next-generation sequencing to locally generate whole genomes from 116 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 118 A(H3N2) positive patient swabs collected across Uganda between 2010 and 2018. We recovered sequences from 92% (215/234) of the swabs, 90% (193/215) of which were whole genomes. The newly-generated sequences were genetically and phylogenetically compared to the WHO-recommended vaccines and other Africa strains sampled since 1994. Uganda strain hemagglutinin (n = 206), neuraminidase (n = 207), and matrix protein (MP, n = 213) sequences had 95.23-99.65%, 95.31-99.79%, and 95.46-100% amino acid similarity to the 2010-2020 season vaccines, respectively, with several mutated hemagglutinin antigenic, receptor binding, and N-linked glycosylation sites. Uganda influenza type-A virus strains sequenced before 2016 clustered uniquely while later strains mixed with other Africa and global strains. We are the first to report novel A(H1N1)pdm09 subclades 6B.1A.3, 6B.1A.5(a,b), and 6B.1A.6 (± T120A) that circulated in Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa in 2017-2019. Africa forms part of the global influenza ecology with high viral genetic diversity, progressive antigenic drift, and local transmissions. For a continent with inadequate health resources and where social distancing is unsustainable, vaccination is the best option. Hence, African stakeholders should prioritise routine genome sequencing and analysis to direct vaccine selection and virus control.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on genetic characterization and phylogenetic comparison of influenza strains but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Virological and Genetic Characterization of the Unusual Avian Influenza H14Nx Viruses in the Northern Asia.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are generally identified as a natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), where a high diversity of subtypes has been detected. Some AIV subtypes are considered to have relatively low prevalence in wild bird populations. Six-year AIV surveillance in Siberia revealed sporadic cases of the rarely identified H14-subtype AIV circulation. Complete genome sequencing of three H14 isolates were performed, and the analysis indicated interconnections between low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. We conducted hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization assays, estimated the susceptibility of isolates to neuraminidase inhibitors, and characterized receptor specificity. Our study revealed circulation of a new H14N9 subtype described for the first time. However, the low prevalence of the H14-subtype AIV population may be the reason for the underestimation of the diversity of H14-subtype AIVs. According to the available data, a region in which H14-subtype viruses were detected several times in 2007-2022 in the Eastern Hemisphere is Western Siberia, while the virus was also detected once in South Asia (Pakistan). Phylogenetic analysis of HA segment sequences revealed the circulation of two clades of H14-subtype viruses originated from initial 1980s Eurasian clade; the first was detected in Northern America and the second in Eurasia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of rare H14 subtype viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A highly efficient and accurate method of detecting and subtyping Influenza A pdm H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with newly emerging mutations in the matrix gene in Eastern Taiwan.
Abstract: The rapid identification of Influenza A virus and its variants, which cause severe respiratory diseases, is imperative to providing timely treatment and improving patient outcomes. Conventionally, two separate assays (total test duration of up to 6 h) are required to initially differentiate Influenza A and B viruses and subsequently distinguish the pdm H1N1 and H3N2 serotypes of Influenza A virus. In this study, we developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR method for simultaneously detecting Influenza A and B viruses and subtyping Influenza A virus, with a substantially reduced test duration. Clinical specimens from hospitalized patients and outpatients with influenza-like symptoms in Eastern Taiwan were collected between 2011 and 2015, transported to Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, and analyzed. Conventional RT-PCR was used to subtype the isolated Influenza A viruses. Thereafter, for rapid identification, the multiplex real-time RT-PCR method was developed and applied to identify the conserved regions that aligned with the available primers and probes. Accordingly, a multiplex RT-PCR assay with three groups of primers and probes (MAF and MAR primers and MA probe; InfAF and InfAR primers and InfA probe; and MBF and MBR primers and MB probe) was established to distinguish these viruses in the same reaction. Thus, with this multiplex RT-PCR assay, Influenza B, Influenza A pdm H1N1, and Influenza A H3N2 viruses were accurately detected and differentiated within only 2.5 h. This multiplex RT-PCR assay showed similar analytical sensitivity to the conventional singleplex assay. Further, the phylogenetic analyses of our samples revealed that the characteristics of these viruses were different from those reported previously using samples collected during 2012-2013. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR method for highly efficient and accurate detection and differentiation of Influenza A and B viruses and subtyping Influenza A virus with a substantially reduced test duration for diagnosis.

Title: Emerging triple-reassortant influenza C virus with household-associated infection during an influenza A(H3N2) outbreak, China, 2022.
Abstract: Recent research have shown that influenza C virus (ICV) has a possible higher clinical impact than previously thought. But knowledge about ICV is limited compared with influenza A and B viruses, due to poor systematic surveillance and inability to propagate. Herein, a case infected with triple reassortant ICV was identified during an influenza A(H3N2) outbreak, which was the first report of ICV infection in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this ICV was triple reassortant. Serological evidence revealed that the index case might be related to family-clustering infection. Therefore, it is essential to heighten surveillance for the prevalence and variation of ICV in China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Relevant: False

Title: Surveillance and Phylogenetic Characterisation of Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Wild Waterfowl in Zambia in 2015, 2020, and 2021.
Abstract: In recent years, the southern African region has experienced repeated incursions of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), with wild migratory birds being implicated in the spread. To understand the profile of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in Zambia, we surveyed wild waterfowl for AIVs and phylogenetically characterised the isolates detected in 2015, 2020, and 2021. A total of 2,851 faecal samples of wild waterfowl were collected from Lochinvar National Park in the Southern Province of Zambia. During the study period, 85 (3.0%) low pathogenicity AIVs belonging to various subtypes were isolated, with H2N9, H8N4, and H10N8 being reported for the first time in avian species in Africa. The majority of the isolates were detected from glossy ibis (order <i>Pelecaniformes</i>) making it the first report of AIV from these birds in Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight gene segments of the 30 full genomes obtained in this study revealed that all the isolates belonged to the Eurasian lineage with their closest relatives being viruses isolated from wild and/or domestic birds in Bangladesh, Belgium, Egypt, Georgia, Mongolia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. Additionally, the Zambian viruses were grouped into distinct clusters based on the year of isolation. While no notifiable AIVs of the H5 or H7 subtypes were detected in wild birds in Zambia, viral internal protein genes of some viruses were closely related to H7 low pathogenicity AIVs. This study shows that periodically, a considerable diversity of AIV subtypes are introduced into the Zambian ecosystem by wild migratory waterfowl. The findings highlight the importance of continuous surveillance and monitoring of AIVs in wild waterfowl, including birds traditionally not considered to be major AIV reservoirs, for a better understanding of the eco-epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of AIVs in Africa.

Title: Emerging Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N8) Virus in <i>Podiceps nigricollis</i> in Northwest China in 2021.
Abstract: Three highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) viruses were detected in the migratory bird <i>Podiceps nigricollis</i> in Northwest China in June 2021. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these H5N8 isolates belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, which were highly homologous to strains isolated in China and South Korea. In this study, H5N8 virus infection in <i>Podiceps nigricollis</i> was detected using Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing technology and caused pathological changes in multiple organs.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics of Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Wild Birds in Moscow.
Abstract: Forty-five strains of AIVs were isolated from wild aquatic birds during their autumn migration through Moscow (Russia). The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of AIV genomes in their natural habitat. Viruses were isolated from fecal sample in embryonated chicken eggs; their complete genomes were sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The gene segments of the same lineage persisted over the years in the absence of persistence of complete viral genomes. The genes for internal proteins of the same lineage were often maintained by the viruses over few years; however, they were typically associated with the genes of novel HA and NA subtypes. Although frequent reassortment events were observed for any pair of internal genes, there was no reassortment between HA and NA segments. The differences in the persistence of phylogenetic lineages of surface and internal proteins and the different evolutionary strategy for these two types of genes of AIVs in primary hosts are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Bidirectional Movement of Emerging H5N8 Avian Influenza Viruses Between Europe and Asia via Migratory Birds Since Early 2020.
Abstract: Migratory birds play a critical role in the rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 across Eurasia. Elucidating the timing and pattern of virus transmission is essential therefore for understanding the spatial dissemination of these viruses. In this study, we surveyed >27,000 wild birds in China, tracked the year-round migration patterns of 20 bird species across China since 2006, and generated new HPAI H5N8 virus genomic data. Using this new data set, we investigated the seasonal transmission dynamics of HPAI H5N8 viruses across Eurasia. We found that introductions of HPAI H5N8 viruses to different Eurasian regions were associated with the seasonal migration of wild birds. Moreover, we report a backflow of HPAI H5N8 virus lineages from Europe to Asia, suggesting that Europe acts as both a source and a sink in the global HPAI virus transmission network.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the movement and transmission dynamics of H5N8 viruses via migratory birds, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Strong host phylogenetic and ecological effects on host competency for avian influenza in Australian wild birds.
Abstract: Host susceptibility to parasites is mediated by intrinsic and external factors such as genetics, ecology, age and season. While waterfowl are considered central to the reservoir community for low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (LPAIV), the role of host phylogeny has received limited formal attention. Herein, we analysed 12 339 oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and 10 826 serum samples collected over 11 years from wild birds in Australia. As well as describing age and species-level differences in prevalence and seroprevalence, we reveal that host phylogeny is a key driver in host range. Seasonality effects appear less pronounced than in the Northern Hemisphere, while annual variations are potentially linked to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Our study provides a uniquely detailed insight into the evolutionary ecology of LPAIV in its avian reservoir community, defining distinctive processes on the continent of Australia and expanding our understanding of LPAIV globally.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes host phylogeny and ecological effects on avian influenza prevalence but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Interactomics: Dozens of Viruses, Co-evolving With Humans, Including the Influenza A Virus, may Actively Distort Human Aging.
Abstract: Some viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus 1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) have been experimentally proposed to accelerate features of human aging and of cellular senescence. These observations, along with evolutionary considerations on viral fitness, raised the more general puzzling hypothesis that, beyond documented sources in human genetics, aging in our species may also depend on virally encoded interactions distorting our aging to the benefits of diverse viruses. Accordingly, we designed systematic network-based analyses of the human and viral protein interactomes, which unraveled dozens of viruses encoding proteins experimentally demonstrated to interact with proteins from pathways associated with human aging, including cellular senescence. We further corroborated our predictions that specific viruses interfere with human aging using published experimental evidence and transcriptomic data; identifying influenza A virus (subtype H1N1) as a major candidate age distorter, notably through manipulation of cellular senescence. By providing original evidence that viruses may convergently contribute to the evolution of numerous age-associated pathways through co-evolution, our network-based and bipartite network-based methodologies support an ecosystemic study of aging, also searching for genetic causes of aging outside a focal aging species. Our findings, predicting age distorters and targets for anti-aging therapies among human viruses, could have fundamental and practical implications for evolutionary biology, aging study, virology, medicine, and demography.

Title: Alloferon and Zanamivir Show Effective Antiviral Activity against Influenza A Virus (H1N1) Infection In Vitro and In Vivo.
Abstract: The use of vaccines is the most effective and reliable method for the prevention of viral infections. However, research on evaluation of effective therapeutic agents for use in treatment after infection is necessary. Zanamivir was administered through inhalation for treatment of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 2009. However, the emergence of drug-resistant strains can occur rapidly. Alloferon, an immunomodulatory drug developed as an NK cell activator, exerts antiviral effects against various viruses, particularly influenza viruses. Therefore, alloferon and zanamivir were administered in combination in an effort to improve the antiviral effect of zanamivir by reducing H1N1 resistance. First, we confirmed that administration of combined treatment would result in effective inhibition of viral proliferation in MDCK and A549 cells infected with H1N1. Production of IL-6 and MIP-1α in these cells and the activity of p38 MAPK and c-<i>Jun</i> that are increased by H1N1 were inhibited by combined treatment. Mice were then infected intranasally with H1N1, and examination of the antiviral efficacy of the alloferon/zanamivir combination was performed. The results showed that combined treatment after infection with H1N1 prevented weight loss, increased the survival rate, and improved lung fibrosis. Combined treatment also resulted in reduced infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs. Combined treatment effectively inhibited the activity of p38 MAPK and c-<i>Jun</i> in lung tissue, which was increased by infection with H1N1. Therefore, the combination of alloferon/zanamivir effectively prevents the development of H1N1-mediated inflammation in the lungs by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and migration of inflammatory cells into lung tissue.

Title: Isolation and Identification of Novel Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N8) Subclade 2.3.4.4b from Geese in Northeastern China.
Abstract: H5N8, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, has become a new zoonotic threat in recent years. As of December 28, 2021, at least 3,206 H5N8 cases had been reported in wild birds and poultry worldwide. In January 2021, a novel virus strain named A/goose/China/1/2021 was isolated during an H5N8 goose influenza outbreak in northeastern China. The PB2, PB1, HA, and M genes of A/goose/China/1/2021 were highly identical to those of H5N8 strains emerging in Kazakhstan and Russia in Central Asia from August to September 2020, while the remaining four genes had the closest homology to those of H5N8 viruses isolated in South Korea in East Asia from November to December 2020. We thus speculate that A/goose/China/1/2021 is likely a reassortant virus that formed in the 2020 to 2021 influenza season and that the migratory birds via the two migration routes of Central Asia and East Asia-Australia may have played an essential role in the genetic reassortment of this virus. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA genes of H5N8 viruses belonging to group II of subclade 2.3.4.4b, including A/goose/China/1/2021, may be derived from strains in Central Asia. Given the complex global spread of H5N8 virus, our study highlights the necessity to strengthen the function of the global surveillance network for H5N8 virus and to accelerate the pace of vaccine development to confront the current challenges posed by H5N8 virus of subclade 2.3.4.4. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> H5N8, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, not only has an impact on public health, but also has a huge negative impact on animal health, food safety, safety, and even on the local and international economy. The migratory wild birds play a vital role in the intercontinental transmission of H5N8 virus. It is urgent that we should strengthen the function of the global surveillance network for H5N8 virus and accelerate the pace of vaccine development to confront the current challenges posed by H5N8 virus of subclade 2.3.4.4.

Abstract: The antiviral activity of technologically processed antibodies to CD4 receptor was evaluated a model of sublethal A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-induced influenza infection in female BALB/c mice. The technologically processed antibodies increased animal survival rate by 50% in comparison with the placebo group (p<0.05), which correlated with significant inhibition of virus replication in the lungs (p<0.05). The reference drug Tamiflu increased mouse survival rate (by 47%), decreased the virus titer in the lungs, and prevented body weight loss (p<0.05 in comparison with the placebo group by all parameters). The intrinsic protective activity of technologically processed antibodies to CD4 receptor was demonstrated, which manifested in a decrease in viral load in the lower respiratory tract and an increase in the survival rate.

Title: Integrating Citizen Scientist Data into the Surveillance System for Avian Influenza Virus, Taiwan.
Abstract: The continuing circulation and reassortment with low-pathogenicity avian influenza Gs/Gd (goose/Guangdong/1996)-like avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has caused huge economic losses and raised public health concerns over the zoonotic potential. Virologic surveillance of wild birds has been suggested as part of a global AIV surveillance system. However, underreporting and biased selection of sampling sites has rendered gaining information about the transmission and evolution of highly pathogenic AIV problematic. We explored the use of the Citizen Scientist eBird database to elucidate the dynamic distribution of wild birds in Taiwan and their potential for AIV exchange with domestic poultry. Through the 2-stage analytical framework, we associated nonignorable risk with 10 species of wild birds with >100 significant positive results. We generated a risk map, which served as the guide for highly pathogenic AIV surveillance. Our methodologic blueprint has the potential to be incorporated into the global AIV surveillance system of wild birds.

Title: Current situation and control strategies of H9N2 avian influenza in South Korea.
Abstract: The H9N2 avian influenza (AI) has become endemic in poultry in many countries since the 1990s, which has caused considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Considering the long history of the low pathogenicity H9N2 AI in many countries, once H9N2 AI is introduced, it is more difficult to eradicate than high pathogenicity AI. Various preventive measures and strategies, including vaccination and active national surveillance, have been used to control the Y439 lineage of H9N2 AI in South Korea, but it took a long time for the H9N2 virus to disappear from the fields. By contrast, the novel Y280 lineage of H9N2 AI was introduced in June 2020 and has spread nationwide. This study reviews the history, genetic and pathogenic characteristics, and control strategies for Korean H9N2 AI. This review may provide some clues for establishing control strategies for endemic AIV and a newly introduced Y280 lineage of H9N2 AI in South Korea.

Title: Analysis of Avian Influenza (H5N5) Viruses Isolated in the Southwestern European Part of the Russian Federation in 2020-2021.
Abstract: In 2021, several isolates of the H5N5 avian influenza virus (AIV) were detected in Europe and the Russian Federation, which differed from those detected in 2020. Genetic analysis revealed a relationship between the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N5 subtype, detected in Europe, and some isolates detected in the Russian Federation territory in 2020-2021: it was shown that both originated in the Caspian Sea regions around the autumn of 2020. The appearance of H5N5 subtype viruses in the spring of 2021 in Europe and the Russian Federation was not associated with the mass migration of birds from Africa. The results of the analysis revealed the presence of a deletion in the stem of a neuraminidase between bp 139 and 204 (open reading frame). It has been shown that AIVs of the H5N5 subtype are capable of long-term circulation in wild bird populations with the possibility of reassortment. The results also highlighted the need for careful monitoring of the circulation of AIVs in the Caspian Sea region, the role of which, in the preservation and emergence of new antigenic variants of such viruses in Eurasia, is currently underestimated.

Title: What's Next for Flu? Out-of-Season Circulation of Influenza Viruses in Southern Italy, August 2022.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the seasonal pattern of respiratory infections. The objective of the present study is to characterize the out-of-season circulation of influenza viruses and an influenza outbreak that occurred in southern Italy in August 2022. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) were tested for the presence of influenza and other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological investigations on 85 patients involved in an influenza outbreak were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin genes was undertaken on samples positive for influenza A. In August 2022, in the Apulia region (Italy), influenza A infection was diagnosed in 19 patients, 18 infected with A/H3N2 and one with A/H1N1pdm09 virus. Seven influenza-positive patients were hospitalized with ILI. A further 17 symptomatic subjects, associated with an influenza outbreak, were also tested; 11 were positive for influenza A/H3N2 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of 12 of the A/H3N2 sequences showed that they all belonged to subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. The A/H1N1pdm09 strain belonged to subclade 6B.1A.5a.2. The out-of-season circulation of the influenza virus during the summer months could be linked to changing dynamics in the post-COVID-19 era, as well as to the impact of climate change. Year-round surveillance of respiratory viruses is needed to monitor this phenomenon and to provide effective prevention strategies.

Title: Matrix-Encoding Gene Diversity of 624 Influenza A/H3N2 Genomes Does Not Show Association with Impaired Viral Detection by Commercialized qPCR Assays.
Abstract: As for the case of SARS-CoV-2, genome sequencing of influenza viruses is of potential interest to raise and address virological issues. Recently, false-negativity of real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assays that detect influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA were reported and associated with two mutations (A37T and C161T) in the Matrix-encoding (M1) gene located on viral segment 7. This triggered a national alert in France. The present study sought to assess the association between the presence of these mutations and potential false negative results of influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA detection by commercialized qPCR assays at the clinical virology laboratory of our university hospitals in southern France. This study focused on the genetic diversity in the M1 gene and segment 7 of 624 influenza A/H3N2 virus genomes obtained from respiratory samples having tested qPCR-positive with M1 gene-targeting assays in our clinical virology laboratory. A total of 585 among the 624 influenza A/H3N2 virus genomes (93.7%) were of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, and 39 (6.3%) were of clade 3C.2a1b.1a. M1 gene substitutions A37T and C161T were both present in 582 (93.3%) genomes, only of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. Substitution A37T was present in 621 (99.5%) genomes. Substitution C161T was present in 585 genomes (93.8%), all of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. Moreover, 21 other nucleotide positions were mutated in ≥90% of the genomes. The present study shows that A37T/C and C161T mutations, and other mutations in the M1 gene and segment 7, were widely present in influenza A/H3N2 virus genomes recovered from respiratory samples diagnosed qPCR-positive with commercialized assays.

Title: Monitoring of Avian Influenza Viruses and Paramyxoviruses in Ponds of Moscow and the Moscow Region.
Abstract: The ponds of the Moscow region during the autumn migration of birds are a place with large concentrations of mallard ducks, which are the main hosts of avulaviruses (avian paramyxoviruses) and influenza A viruses (IAV). The purpose of this study was the determination of the biological diversity of IAV and avulaviruses isolated from mallards in Moscow's ponds. A phylogenetic analysis of IAV was performed based on complete genome sequencing, and virus genomic reassortment in nature was studied. Almost all IAV genome segments clustered with apathogenic duck viruses according to phylogenetic analysis. The origin of the genes of Moscow isolates were different; some of them belong to European evolutionary branches, some to Asian ones. The majority of closely related viruses have been isolated in the Western Eurasian region. Much less frequently, closely related viruses have been isolated in Siberia, China, and Korea. The quantity and diversity of isolated viruses varied considerably depending on the year and have decreased since 2014, perhaps due to the increasing proportion of nesting and wintering ducks in Moscow.

Title: Emergence of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b in Wild Birds and Poultry in Botswana.
Abstract: Numerous outbreaks of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) were reported during 2020-2021. In Africa, H5Nx has been detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa in both wild birds and poultry. Botswana reported its first outbreak of HPAI to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) in 2021. An H5N1 virus was detected in a fish eagle, doves, and chickens. Full genome sequence analysis revealed that the virus belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b and showed high identity within haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase proteins (NA) for viruses identified across a geographically broad range of locations. The detection of H5N1 in Botswana has important implications for disease management, wild bird conservation, tourism, public health, economic empowerment of vulnerable communities and food security in the region.

Title: Genetic evolution of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in Thailand.
Abstract: Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses and the emergence of the genetic-related hemagglutinin (<i>HA</i>) gene of reassortant H5Nx viruses currently circulating in wild birds and poultries pose a great global public health concern. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the genetic evolution of Thai H5N1 <i>HA</i> and neuraminidase (<i>NA</i>) genes between 2003 and 2010. The H5N1 Thailand virus clade 2.3.4 was also genetically compared to the currently circulating clade 2.3.4.4 of H5Nx viruses. Full-length nucleotide sequences of 178 <i>HA</i> and 143 <i>NA</i> genes of H5N1 viruses circulating between 2003 and 2010 were phylogenetically analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic construction. Bayesian phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using BEAST analysis with a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was determined, and the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was estimated. The H5N1 HA nucleotide sequences of clade 2.3.4 Thailand viruses were phylogenetically analyzed using ML phylogenetic tree construction and analyzed for nucleotide similarities with various subtypes of reassortant H5Nx HA clade 2.3.4.4. ML phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct HA clades, clade 1 and clade 2.3.4, and two distinct NA groups within the corresponding H5 clade 1 viruses. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction for molecular clock suggested that the Thai H5N1 HA and NA emerged in 2001.87 (95% HPD: 2001.34-2002.49) and 2002.38 (95% HPD: 2001.99-2002.82), respectively, suggesting that the virus existed before it was first reported in 2004. The Thai H5N1 HA clade 2.3.4 was grouped into corresponding clades 2.3.4, 2.3.4.1, 2.3.4.2, and 2.3.4.3, and shared nucleotide similarities to reassortant H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 ranged from 92.4-96.8%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 evolved from H5N1 clade 2.3.4. H5N1 viruses existed, and were presumably introduced and circulated in avian species in Thailand, before they were officially reported in 2004. <i>HA</i> and <i>NA</i> genes continuously evolved during circulation between 2004 and 2010. This study provides a better understanding of genetic evolution with respect to molecular epidemiology. Monitoring and surveillance of emerging variants/reassortants should be continued.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic evolution and phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes such as pathogenicity or transmissibility.

Title: sitePath: a visual tool to identify polymorphism clades and help find fixed and parallel mutations.
Abstract: Identifying polymorphism clades on phylogenetic trees could help detect punctual mutations that are associated with viral functions. With visualization tools coloring the tree, it is easy to visually find clades where most sequences have the same polymorphism state. However, with the fast accumulation of viral sequences, a computational tool to automate this process is urgently needed. Here, by implementing a branch-and-bound-like search method, we developed an R package named sitePath to identify polymorphism clades automatically. Based on the identified polymorphism clades, fixed and parallel mutations could be inferred. Furthermore, sitePath also integrated visualization tools to generate figures of the calculated results. In an example with the influenza A virus H3N2 dataset, the detected fixed mutations coincide with antigenic shift mutations. The highly specificity and sensitivity of sitePath in finding fixed mutations were achieved for a range of parameters and different phylogenetic tree inference software. The result suggests that sitePath can identify polymorphism clades per site. The clustering of sequences on a phylogenetic tree can be used to infer fixed and parallel mutations. High-quality figures of the calculated results could also be generated by sitePath.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a computational tool to identify polymorphism clades and mutations but does not itself analyze explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: No molecular evidence for influenza A virus and coronavirus in bats belonging to the families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate, by molecular methods, the presence of influenza A virus (IAV) and coronavirus in non-hematophagous bats collected in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Samples of lung tissue and small intestine from 105 bats belonging to three families (Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) were collected in 22 municipalities in the state of São Paulo. Genetic identification of bats species was performed by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of 710 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene. In the detection of IAV, genomes were performed by RT-PCR, aiming at the amplification of a 245-bp fragment of the IAV matrix (M) protein gene. For coronaviruses, two fragments of 602 and 440 bp corresponding to segments along the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were targeted. The detection limit for each of the PCRs was also determined. All samples analyzed here were negative for both viruses, and the lower limit of detection of the PCRs for the amplification of influenza virus A and coronavirus was estimated at 3.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 4.59 genomic copies per microliter, respectively. Although bats have been shown to harbor a large number of pathogens, the results of the present study support the theory that virus circulation in bats in the wild often occurs at low viral loads and that our understanding of the complex infectious dynamics of these viruses in wild conditions is still limited.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports negative molecular detection results for influenza and coronavirus in bats, with no genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Aerosol exposure of live bird market workers to viable influenza A/H5N1 and A/H9N2 viruses, Cambodia.
Abstract: Live bird markets (LBMs) have been identified as key factors in the spread, persistence and evolution of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In addition, these settings have been associated with human infections with AIVs of pandemic concern. Exposure to aerosolised AIVs by workers in a Cambodian LBM was assessed using aerosol impact samplers. LBM vendors were asked to wear an air sampler for 30 min per day for 1 week while continuing their usual activities in the LBM during a period of high AIV circulation (February) and a period of low circulation (May). During the period of high circulation, AIV RNA was detected from 100% of the air samplers using molecular methods and viable AIV (A/H5N1 and/or A/H9N2) was isolated from 50% of air samplers following inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs. In contrast, AIV was not detected by molecular methods or successfully isolated during the period of low circulation. This study demonstrates the increased risk of aerosol exposure of LBM workers to AIVs during periods of high circulation and highlights the need for interventions during these high-risk periods. Novel approaches, such as environmental sampling, should be further explored at key high-risk interfaces as a potentially cost-effective alternative for monitoring pandemic threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses aerosol exposure and virus detection in live bird markets but does not analyze genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics of Whole-Genome Influenza A/H3N2 Viruses Isolated in Myanmar from 2015 to 2019.
Abstract: This study aimed to analyze the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of the influenza A/H3N2 viruses circulating in Myanmar from 2015 to 2019. Whole genomes from 79 virus isolates were amplified using real-time polymerase chain reaction and successfully sequenced using the Illumina iSeq100 platforms. Eight individual phylogenetic trees were retrieved for each segment along with those of the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains for the respective years. Based on the WHO clades classification, the A/H3N2 strains in Myanmar from 2015 to 2019 collectively belonged to clade 3c.2. These strains were further defined based on hemagglutinin substitutions as follows: clade 3C.2a (<i>n</i> = 39), 3C.2a1 (<i>n</i> = 2), and 3C.2a1b (<i>n</i> = 38). Genetic analysis revealed that the Myanmar strains differed from the Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains each year, indicating that the vaccine strains did not match the circulating strains. The highest rates of nucleotide substitution were estimated for hemagglutinin (3.37 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year) and neuraminidase (2.89 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year). The lowest rate was for non-structural protein segments (4.19 × 10<sup>-5</sup> substitutions/site/year). The substantial genetic diversity that was revealed improved phylogenetic classification. This information will be particularly relevant for improving vaccine strain selection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H3N2 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prevalence of the H5N8 influenza virus in birds: Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, considered highly pathogenic (HPAI). They result from genetic variations from their low virulence predecessors. HPAI is a global problem. Large outbreaks of HAPI have significant health and economic impacts. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of the H5N8 Influenza virus in birds, as well as to assess its variability according to the countries and years. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in six databases (Web of Sciences, Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, Lilacs and Google Scholar) to evaluate the proportion of birds infected with the H5N8 Influenza virus, by molecular and immunological techniques. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A 2-tailed 5% alpha level was used for hypothesis testing. Measures of heterogeneity were estimated and reported, including the Cochrane Q statistic, the I<sup>2</sup> index, and the tau-squared test. In addition, bird species performed subgroup analyzes. 152 data groups were analyzed, a combined prevalence of 1.6% (95% CI 1.3-1.9%) was found for molecular studies, and the ELISA study yielded a seroprevalence of 66.7%; those results of molecular detection varied by year, from 0.2% in 2014 to 52.6% in 2020 and 96.9% in 2015. The combined prevalence was substantial because large outbreaks have caused severe economic repercussions. In addition, it is considered a serious concern for public health due to its possible zoonotic activity.

Reason: The paper focuses on prevalence and meta-analysis of H5N8 influenza virus in birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolution of Influenza Viruses-Drug Resistance, Treatment Options, and Prospects.
Abstract: Viral evolution refers to the genetic changes that a virus accumulates during its lifetime which can arise from adaptations in response to environmental changes or the immune response of the host. Influenza A virus is one of the most rapidly evolving microorganisms. Its genetic instability may lead to large changes in its biological properties, including changes in virulence, adaptation to new hosts, and even the emergence of infectious diseases with a previously unknown clinical course. Genetic variability makes it difficult to implement effective prophylactic programs, such as vaccinations, and may be responsible for resistance to antiviral drugs. The aim of the review was to describe the consequences of the variability of influenza viruses, mutations, and recombination, which allow viruses to overcome species barriers, causing epidemics and pandemics. Another consequence of influenza virus evolution is the risk of the resistance to antiviral drugs. Thus far, one class of drugs, M2 protein inhibitors, has been excluded from use because of mutations in strains isolated in many regions of the world from humans and animals. Therefore, the effectiveness of anti-influenza drugs should be continuously monitored in reference centers representing particular regions of the world as a part of epidemiological surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus evolution and drug resistance broadly without presenting explicit experimental links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Two Novel Avian Influenza Virus Subtypes Isolated from Domestic Ducks in North of Iran.
Abstract: Avian Influenza Viruses (AIV) are the causative agents of Avian Influenza (AI), which is a contagious and zoonotic disease in birds. Among birds, wild waterfowls and ducks are the primary and natural reservoirs of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI). This study aimed to identify and differentiate between two AIV subtypes (i.e., hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from domestic ducks by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays. To this end, 962 cloacal swabs were collected from domestic ducks being sold at different Iranian Live Bird Markets in Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan provinces, located at the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The samples were inoculated in 10-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs, and subsequently, harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to agar gel immunodiffusion, HI, and NI assays. In total, five positive samples, including two H4N2 and three H3N2 AIV subtypes were identified. Isolation of H4N2 and H3N2 viruses has never been reported from Iranian domestic ducks previously. This finding further suggests the diversity of LPAI viruses in Iranian ducks and also shows that the HI and NI assays are highly efficient in determining AIV subtypes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies and differentiates AIV subtypes by serological assays without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Clinical features of the first critical case of acute encephalitis caused by the avian influenza A (H5N6) virus.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), such as H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9, have been reported to frequently infect humans, but acute encephalitis caused by HPAIV in humans has been rarely reported. We report the first critical case of acute encephalitis with mild pneumonia caused by the H5N6 virus. On January 25 of 2022, a 6-year-old girl with severe neurological symptoms was admitted to our hospital and rapidly developed into seizures and coma. Brain imaging showed abnormalities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) presented abnormal slow waves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained elevated protein (1.64 g/L) and white cells (546 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L). Laboratory investigations revealed abnormally elevated transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and cytokines in serum. A novel reassortant H5N6 virus was identified from the patient's serum, CSF, and tracheal aspirate specimens. Phylogenic analysis indicated that this virus was a novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H5N6) virus that belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b. This patient was diagnosed with acute encephalitis and discharged from the hospital accompanied by a language barrier. An epidemiological investigation confirmed that wild waterfowls were the direct source of infection in this case. Our study highlights the urgent need to pay attention to acute encephalitis caused by HPAIV.

Title: Co-circulation of coronavirus and avian influenza virus in wild birds in Shanghai (2020-2021).
Abstract: Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses has been reported worldwide in humans. Wild birds are natural reservoir hosts for coronaviruses (CoVs) and avian influenza viruses (AIVs). It is unknown whether co-infection with these two types of viruses occurs in wild birds. In this study, the prevalence of co-infection with CoV and AIV in wild birds in Shanghai, China during 2020-2021 was investigated by detecting these viruses in cloacal, tracheal, and faecal samples. Results showed that the overall rate of samples positive for both CoV and AIV was 3.3% (82/2510; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6%-4.0%), and that was mainly from Anseriformes. In CoV-positive samples, 38.9% (82/211; 95% CI: 32.5%-45.6%) of them had both CoVs and AIVs, whereas only 26.9% (82/305; 95% CI: 22.2%-32.1%) of AIV-positive samples had both CoVs and AIVs. These results suggest that CoV infection in wild birds renders them more susceptible to AIV infection. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences of CoVs revealed that gamma-CoVs mainly cluster with duck CoVs and that delta-CoVs are more diversified and cluster with those of various wild birds. Continual surveillance is necessity to monitor the transmission and evolution of co-infection of these two types of viruses in their natural hosts.

Title: Novel Zoonotic Avian Influenza A(H3N8) Virus in Chicken, Hong Kong, China.
Abstract: Zoonotic and pandemic influenza continue to pose threats to global public health. Pandemics arise when novel influenza A viruses, derived in whole or in part from animal or avian influenza viruses, adapt to transmit efficiently in a human population that has little population immunity to contain its onward transmission. Viruses of previous pandemic concern, such as influenza A(H7N9), arose from influenza A(H9N2) viruses established in domestic poultry acquiring a hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from influenza A viruses of aquatic waterfowl. We report a novel influenza A(H3N8) virus in chicken that has emerged in a similar manner and that has been recently reported to cause zoonotic disease. Although they are H3 subtype, these avian viruses are antigenically distant from contemporary human influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and there is little cross-reactive immunity in the human population. It is essential to heighten surveillance for these avian A(H3N8) viruses in poultry and in humans.

Title: Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Analysis of Avian Influenza A(H5) Viruses Circulating in Egypt, 2019-2021.
Abstract: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was first detected in Egypt in late 2016. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly among different poultry sectors, becoming the dominant HPAI H5 subtype reported in Egypt. Different genotypes of the HPAI H5N8 virus were reported in Egypt; however, the geographic patterns and molecular evolution of the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 viruses are still unclear. Here, extensive epidemiological surveillance was conducted, including more than half a million samples collected from different poultry sectors (farms/backyards/live bird markets) from all governorates in Egypt during 2019-2021. In addition, genetic characterization and evolutionary analyses were performed using 47 selected positive H5N8 isolates obtained during the same period. The result of the conducted surveillance showed that HPAI H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b continue to circulate in different locations in Egypt, with an obvious seasonal pattern, and no further detection of the HPAI H5N1 virus of clade 2.2.1.2 was observed in the poultry population during 2019-2021. In addition, phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses revealed that two major genotypes (G5 and G6) of HPAI H5N8 viruses were continually expanding among the poultry sectors in Egypt. Notably, molecular dating analysis suggested that the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 virus is the potential ancestral viruses of the European H5N8 viruses of 2020-2021. In summary, the data of this study highlight the current epidemiology, diversity, and evolution of HPAI H5N8 viruses in Egypt and call for continuous monitoring of the genetic features of the avian influenza viruses in Egypt.

Title: The influenza A virus genome packaging network - complex, flexible and yet unsolved.
Abstract: The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) consists of eight unique viral RNA segments. This genome organization allows genetic reassortment between co-infecting IAV strains, whereby new IAVs with altered genome segment compositions emerge. While it is known that reassortment events can create pandemic IAVs, it remains impossible to anticipate reassortment outcomes with pandemic prospects. Recent research indicates that reassortment is promoted by a viral genome packaging mechanism that delivers the eight genome segments as a supramolecular complex into the virus particle. This finding holds promise of predicting pandemic IAVs by understanding the intermolecular interactions governing this genome packaging mechanism. Here, we critically review the prevailing mechanistic model postulating that IAV genome packaging is orchestrated by a network of intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Although we find supporting evidence, including segment-specific packaging signals and experimentally proposed RNA-RNA interaction networks, this mechanistic model remains debatable due to a current shortage of functionally validated intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. We speculate that identifying such functional intersegmental RNA-RNA contacts might be hampered by limitations of the utilized probing techniques and the inherent complexity of the genome packaging mechanism. Nevertheless, we anticipate that improved probing strategies combined with a mutagenesis-based validation could facilitate their discovery.

Title: ProbeTools: designing hybridization probes for targeted genomic sequencing of diverse and hypervariable viral taxa.
Abstract: Sequencing viruses in many specimens is hindered by excessive background material from hosts, microbiota, and environmental organisms. Consequently, enrichment of target genomic material is necessary for practical high-throughput viral genome sequencing. Hybridization probes are widely used for enrichment in many fields, but their application to viral sequencing faces a major obstacle: it is difficult to design panels of probe oligo sequences that broadly target many viral taxa due to their rapid evolution, extensive diversity, and genetic hypervariability. To address this challenge, we created ProbeTools, a package of bioinformatic tools for generating effective viral capture panels, and for assessing coverage of target sequences by probe panel designs in silico. In this study, we validated ProbeTools by designing a panel of 3600 probes for subtyping the hypervariable haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genome segments of avian-origin influenza A viruses (AIVs). Using in silico assessment of AIV reference sequences and in vitro capture on egg-cultured viral isolates, we demonstrated effective performance by our custom AIV panel and ProbeTools' suitability for challenging viral probe design applications. Based on ProbeTool's in silico analysis, our panel provided broadly inclusive coverage of 14,772 HA and 11,967 NA reference sequences. For each reference sequence, we calculated the percentage of nucleotide positions covered by our panel in silico; 90% of HA and NA references sequences had at least 90.8 and 95.1% of their nucleotide positions covered respectively. We also observed effective in vitro capture on a representative collection of 23 egg-cultured AIVs that included isolates from wild birds, poultry, and humans and representatives from all HA and NA subtypes. Forty-two of forty-six HA and NA segments had over 98.3% of their nucleotide positions significantly enriched by our custom panel. These in vitro results were further used to validate ProbeTools' in silico coverage assessment algorithm; 89.2% of in silico predictions were concordant with in vitro results. ProbeTools generated an effective panel for subtyping AIVs that can be deployed for genomic surveillance, outbreak prevention, and pandemic preparedness. Effective probe design against hypervariable AIV targets also validated ProbeTools' design and coverage assessment algorithms, demonstrating their suitability for other challenging viral capture applications.

Title: Isolation of Genetically Diverse H5N8 Avian Influenza Viruses in Poultry in Egypt, 2019-2021.
Abstract: The global spread of avian influenza virus (AIV) of clade 2.3.4.4b since 2016 has caused severe losses in wild birds and poultry and has posed a risk for the infection of mammals including humans. The vaccination of poultry has been used to limit the spread of the virus and mitigate its socioeconomic impact. Here, we describe H5N8 epidemics in chickens, turkeys and ducks from different localities in Egypt from 2019 to 2021. About 41.7% (<i>n</i> = 88/211) flocks were tested positive by RT-qPCR for H5N8 viruses with prevalence rates of 45.1% (<i>n</i> = 65/144) and 34.3% (<i>n</i> = 23/67) in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks, respectively. A sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes indicated not only the multiple introduction events of H5N8 viruses in Egypt but also the establishment of endemic viruses in commercial poultry in 2020/2021. The recent H5N8 viruses in poultry in Egypt are genetically distinct from the majority of licensed vaccines used in the field. Together, our findings indicate that poultry in Egypt is an endemic center for clade 2.3.4.4b in the Middle East. The efficiency of current vaccines should be regularly evaluated and updated to fully protect poultry flocks in Egypt against H5N8 viruses.

Title: Genotype Uniformity, Wild Bird-to-Poultry Transmissions, and Farm-to-Farm Carryover during the Spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N8 in the Czech Republic in 2021.
Abstract: In 2020-2021, the second massive dissemination of a highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5Nx subtype occurred in Europe. During this period, the virus caused numerous outbreaks in poultry, including in the Czech Republic. In the present study, we provide an insight into the genetic variability of the Czech/2021 (CZE/2021) H5N8 viruses to determine the relationships between strains from wild and domestic poultry and to infer transmission routes between the affected flocks of commercial poultry. For this purpose, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 70 H5N8 genomes representing 79.7% of the cases were performed. All CZE/2021 H5N8 viruses belonged to the 2.3.4.4b H5 lineage and circulated without reassortment, retaining the A/chicken/Iraq/1/2020 H5N8-like genotype constellation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the frequent local transmission of H5N8 from wild birds to backyard poultry and extensive spread among commercial poultry farms. In addition, the analysis suggested one cross-border transmission event. Indirect transmission via contaminated materials was considered the most likely source of infection. Improved biosecurity and increased collaboration between field veterinarians and the laboratory are essential to limit the local spread of the virus and to reveal and interrupt critical routes of infection.

Title: Use of the ISU <i>FLU</i>ture multisequence identity tool for rapid interpretation of swine influenza A virus sequences in the United States.
Abstract: Rapid and reliable identification of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genetic clades of an influenza A virus (IAV) sequence from swine can inform control measures and multivalent vaccine composition. Current approaches to genetically characterize HA or NA sequences are based on nucleotide similarity or phylogenetic analyses. Public databases exist to acquire IAV genetic sequences for comparison, but personnel at the diagnostic or production level have difficulty in adequately updating and maintaining relevant sequence datasets for IAV in swine. Further, phylogenetic analyses are time intensive, and inference drawn from these methods is impacted by input sequence data and associated metadata. We describe here the use of the IAV multisequence identity tool as an integrated public webpage located on the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) <i>FLU</i>ture website: https://influenza.cvm.iastate.edu/. The multisequence identity tool uses sequence data derived from IAV-positive cases sequenced at the ISU-VDL, employs a BLAST algorithm that identifies sequences that are genetically similar to submitted query sequences, and presents a tabulation and visualization of the most genetically similar IAV sequence and associated metadata from the <i>FLU</i>ture database. Our tool removes bioinformatic barriers and allows clients, veterinarians, and researchers to rapidly classify and identify IAV sequences similar to their own sequences to augment interpretation of results.

Title: Emergence of circulating influenza A H3N2 viruses with genetic drift in the matrix gene: be alert of false-negative test results.
Abstract: In March 2022, we observed samples with a negative fluorescent signal (60.5%, n = 43) for the influenza A matrix gene and a stronger positive signal for subtype A(H3N2). Forty-three samples were positive in InfA (H3N2) (mean Cq 30.9, range 23.9-35.1), and 26 of the 43 samples were negative in InfA matrix (mean Cq 28.0, range 23.2-30.6). Our multiplex test is a laboratory-developed four-target, four-color influenza A reverse-transcription PCR assay targeting the matrix gene, subtypes A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09. Several samples were negative when retested on commercial influenza Point-of-Care assays. As the matrix gene is a stand-alone target in most commercial diagnostic assays, we caution against false-negative subtype A test results.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on detection issues due to genetic drift in the matrix gene affecting diagnostic test results, without linking genotype changes to viral phenotypes.

Title: Development of a Rapid Fluorescent Diagnostic System for Early Detection of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 Clade 2.3.4.4 Viruses in Chicken Stool.
Abstract: Rapid diagnosis is essential for the control and prevention of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). However, highly sensitive and rapid diagnostic systems have shown limited performance due to specific antibody scarcity. In this study, two novel specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses were developed by using an immunogen from a reversed genetic influenza virus (RGV). These mAbs were combined with fluorescence europium nanoparticles and an optimized lysis buffer, which were further used for developing a fluorescent immunochromatographic rapid strip test (FICT) for early detection of H5Nx influenza viruses on chicken stool samples. The result indicates that the limit of detection (LoD) of the developed FICT was 40 HAU/mL for detection of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4b in spiked chicken stool samples, which corresponded to 4.78 × 10<sup>4</sup> RNA copies as obtained from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An experimental challenge of chicken with H5N6 HPAIV is lethal for chicken three days post-infection (DPI). Interestingly, our FICT could detect H5N6 in stool samples at 2 DPI earlier, with 100% relative sensitivity in comparison with RT-PCR, and it showed 50% higher sensitivity than the traditional colloidal gold-based rapid diagnostic test using the same mAbs pair. In conclusion, our rapid diagnostic method can be utilized for the early detection of H5Nx 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs in avian fecal samples from poultry farms or for influenza surveillance in wild migratory birds.

Title: Potential Threats to Human Health from Eurasian Avian-Like Swine Influenza A(H1N1) Virus and Its Reassortants.
Abstract: During 2018-2020, we isolated 32 Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses and their reassortant viruses from pigs in China. Genomic testing identified a novel reassortant H3N1 virus, which emerged in late 2020. Derived from G4 Eurasian H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza viruses. This virus poses a risk for zoonotic infection.

Title: Genetic subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA from avian influenza virus in wild birds from Peru reveals unique features among circulating strains in America.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) represents a major concern with productive implications in poultry systems but it is also a zoonotic agent that possesses an intrinsic pandemic risk. AIV is an enveloped, negative-sense and single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. The eight genomic segments, comprising the whole genome, encode for eleven proteins. Within these proteins, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) are the most relevant for studies of evolution and pathogenesis considering their role in viral replication, and have also been used for classification purposes. Migratory birds are the main hosts and play a pivotal role in viral evolution and dissemination due to their migratory routes that comprise large regions worldwide. Altogether, viral and reservoir factors contribute to the emergence of avian influenza viruses with novel features and pathogenic potentials. The study aimed to conduct surveillance of AIVs in wild birds from Peru. A multi-site screening of feces of migratory birds was performed to isolate viruses and to characterize the whole genome sequences, especially the genes coding for HA and NA proteins. Four-hundred-twenty-one (421) fecal samples, collected between March 2019 and March 2020 in Lima, were obtained from 21 species of wild birds. From these, we isolated five AIV from whimbrel, kelp gull, Franklin's gulls and Mallard, which were of low pathogenicity, including four subtypes as H6N8, H13N6, H6N2 and H2N6. Genetic analysis of HA and NA genes revealed novel features in these viruses and phylogenetic analysis exhibited a close relationship with those identified in North America (US and Canada). Furthermore, H2N6 isolate presented a NA sequence with higher genetic relationship to Chilean isolates. These results highlight that the geographical factor is of major relevance in the evolution of AIV, suggesting that AIV circulating in Peru might represent a new site for the emergence of reassortant AIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study centers on genetic subtyping and phylogenetic analysis without explicit discussion of phenotype or functional consequences of genotypes.

Title: Maintenance and dissemination of avian-origin influenza A virus within the northern Atlantic Flyway of North America.
Abstract: Wild waterbirds, the natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses, undergo migratory movements each year, connecting breeding and wintering grounds within broad corridors known as flyways. In a continental or global view, the study of virus movements within and across flyways is important to understanding virus diversity, evolution, and movement. From 2015 to 2017, we sampled waterfowl from breeding (Maine) and wintering (Maryland) areas within the Atlantic Flyway (AF) along the east coast of North America to investigate the spatio-temporal trends in persistence and spread of influenza A viruses (IAV). We isolated 109 IAVs from 1,821 cloacal / oropharyngeal samples targeting mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American black ducks (Anas rubripes), two species having ecological and conservation importance in the flyway that are also host reservoirs of IAV. Isolates with >99% nucleotide similarity at all gene segments were found between eight pairs of birds in the northern site across years, indicating some degree of stability among genome constellations and the possibility of environmental persistence. No movement of whole genome constellations were identified between the two parts of the flyway, however, virus gene flow between the northern and southern study locations was evident. Examination of banding records indicate direct migratory waterfowl movements between the two locations within an annual season, providing a mechanism for the inferred viral gene flow. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for virus dissemination from other North American wild birds to AF dabbling ducks (Anatinae), shorebirds (Charidriformes), and poultry (Galliformes). Evidence was found for virus dissemination from shorebirds to gulls (Laridae), and dabbling ducks to shorebirds and poultry. The findings from this study contribute to the understanding of IAV ecology in waterfowl within the AF.

Title: Cross-reactive immunity potentially drives global oscillation and opposed alternation patterns of seasonal influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Several human pathogens exhibit distinct patterns of seasonality and circulate as pairs. For instance, influenza A virus subtypes oscillate and peak during winter seasons of the world's temperate climate zones. Alternation of dominant strains in successive influenza seasons makes epidemic forecasting a major challenge. From the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic we enrolled influenza A virus infected patients (n = 2980) in a global prospective clinical study. Complete hemagglutinin sequences were obtained from 1078 A/H1N1 and 1033 A/H3N2 viruses. We used phylodynamics to construct high resolution spatio-temporal phylogenetic hemagglutinin trees and estimated global influenza A effective reproductive numbers (R) over time (2009-2013). We demonstrate that R oscillates around R = 1 with a clear opposed alternation pattern between phases of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. Moreover, we find a similar alternation pattern for the number of global viral spread between the sampled geographical locations. Both observations suggest a between-strain competition for susceptible hosts on a global level. Extrinsic factors that affect person-to-person transmission are a major driver of influenza seasonality. The data presented here indicate that cross-reactive host immunity is also a key intrinsic driver of influenza seasonality, which determines the influenza A virus strain at the onset of each epidemic season.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiological and phylodynamic patterns of influenza virus spread and seasonality without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Clinical and phylogenetic influenza dynamics for the 2019-20 season in the global influenza hospital surveillance network (GIHSN) - Pilot study.
Abstract: The Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) has operated with the aim of investigating epidemiological and clinical factors related to severe influenza-related hospitalisations. A common GIHSN core protocol for prospective patient enrolment was implemented. Hospital personnel completed a standardized questionnaire regarding the included patients' medical history, compiled a hospitalisation summary, collected an upper respiratory swab sample for laboratory diagnosis, and genome sequencing was performed for a subset of samples. Patient data were compared according to influenza subtype, lineage, and phylogenetic groups using the Fisher's exact test. From September 2019 to May 2020, 8791 patients aged ≥5 years were included. Among them, 3021 (34.4%) had a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominated the season among all age groups, while the B/Victoria-like lineage accounted for over half of the infections among younger age groups (5-49 years). Sequencing of the hemagglutinin segment was possible for 623 samples and revealed an influenza A and B clade frequency among severe influenza hospitalisations similar to other medically attended surveillance networks, such as the WHO GISRS. No phylogenetic clustering was observed among hemagglutinin substitutions depending on the administration of supplemental oxygen or vaccine failure. The GIHSN confirms its ability as an international hospital-based active surveillance network to provide valuable information on influenza infection dynamics in hospital settings. Increasing the number of participating sites and compiling more complete data, such as genome sequencing, will allow the exploration of associations between viral factors, vaccine protection, and disease severity.

Reason: The study reports clinical and phylogenetic surveillance data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Australia as a global sink for the genetic diversity of avian influenza A virus.
Abstract: Most of our understanding of the ecology and evolution of avian influenza A virus (AIV) in wild birds is derived from studies conducted in the northern hemisphere on waterfowl, with a substantial bias towards dabbling ducks. However, relevant environmental conditions and patterns of avian migration and reproduction are substantially different in the southern hemisphere. Through the sequencing and analysis of 333 unique AIV genomes collected from wild birds collected over 15 years we show that Australia is a global sink for AIV diversity and not integrally linked with the Eurasian gene pool. Rather, AIV are infrequently introduced to Australia, followed by decades of isolated circulation and eventual extinction. The number of co-circulating viral lineages varies per subtype. AIV haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes that are rarely identified at duck-centric study sites (H8-12) had more detected introductions and contemporary co-circulating lineages in Australia. Combined with a lack of duck migration beyond the Australian-Papuan region, these findings suggest introductions by long-distance migratory shorebirds. In addition, on the available data we found no evidence of directional or consistent patterns in virus movement across the Australian continent. This feature corresponds to patterns of bird movement, whereby waterfowl have nomadic and erratic rainfall-dependant distributions rather than consistent intra-continental migratory routes. Finally, we detected high levels of virus gene segment reassortment, with a high diversity of AIV genome constellations across years and locations. These data, in addition to those from other studies in Africa and South America, clearly show that patterns of AIV dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere are distinct from those in the temperate north.

Reason: The paper focuses on the genetic diversity and phylogenetics of avian influenza A virus in Australia without linking specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Role of wild birds in the spread of clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus into South Korea and Japan.
Abstract: H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have caused transboundary epizootics in poultry and wild birds. In 2016, the H5N6 subtype of clade 2.3.4.4e HPAIVs caused multiple outbreaks in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. However, the geographical spread pattern of 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV has not been clearly identified. To better understand the emergence and transmission history of 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV, we investigated the underlying epidemiologic processes associated with this viral spread by performing a Bayesian phylogeography analysis. The results revealed that wild waterfowl played a central role in the transboundary spread of clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV into both endemic and non-endemic countries, causing multiple incursions of the 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIV into South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. In our analysis, Guangdong province, China was estimated to be the most probable site where 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAIVs emerged prior to the transboundary transmissions. Continued genomic surveillance in both wild birds and poultry would be necessary for monitoring of HPAIV incursions. In addition, enhanced biosecurity would be key to preventing the HPAIV spread by minimizing contact between domestic poultry and wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on epidemiological and phylogeographic analysis of viral spread by wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: RF-Net 2: fast inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks.
Abstract: A phylogenetic network is a powerful model to represent entangled evolutionary histories with both divergent (speciation) and convergent (e.g. hybridization, reassortment, recombination) evolution. The standard approach to inference of hybridization networks is to (i) reconstruct rooted gene trees and (ii) leverage gene tree discordance for network inference. Recently, we introduced a method called RF-Net for accurate inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks from input gene trees in the presence of errors commonly found in phylogenetic trees. While RF-Net demonstrated the ability to accurately infer networks with up to four reticulations from erroneous input gene trees, its application was limited by the number of reticulations it could handle in a reasonable amount of time. This limitation is particularly restrictive in the inference of the evolutionary history of segmented RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), where reassortment is one of the major mechanisms shaping the evolution of these pathogens. Here, we expand the functionality of RF-Net that makes it significantly more applicable in practice. Crucially, we introduce a fast extension to RF-Net, called Fast-RF-Net, that can handle large numbers of reticulations without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, we develop automatic stopping criteria to select the appropriate number of reticulations heuristically and implement a feature for RF-Net to output error-corrected input gene trees. We then conduct a comprehensive study of the original method and its novel extensions and confirm their efficacy in practice using extensive simulation and empirical IAV evolutionary analyses. RF-Net 2 is available at https://github.com/flu-crew/rf-net-2. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a computational method for inferring virus reassortment and hybridization networks from gene trees, focusing on methodology rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Structural analysis of N-glycans in chicken trachea and lung reveals potential receptors of chicken influenza viruses.
Abstract: Although avian influenza A viruses (avian IAVs) bind preferentially to terminal sialic acids (Sia) on glycans that possess Siaα2-3Gal, the actual glycan structures found in chicken respiratory tracts have not been reported. Herein, we analyzed N-glycan structures in chicken trachea and lung, the main target tissues of low pathogenic avian IAVs. 2-Aminopyridine (PA)-labeled N-glycans from chicken tissues were analyzed by combined methods using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC), electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS), MS/MS, and multistage MS (MS<sup>n</sup>), with or without modifications using exoglycosidases, sialic acid linkage-specific alkylamidation (SALSA), and/or permethylation. The results of SALSA indicated that PA-N-glycans in both chicken trachea and lung harbored slightly more α2,6-Sia than α2,3-Sia. Most α2,3-Sia on N-glycans in chicken trachea was a fucosylated form (sialyl Lewis X, sLe<sup>x</sup>), whereas no sLe<sup>x</sup> was detected in lung. By contrast, small amounts of N-glycans with 6-sulfo sialyl LacNAc were detected in lung but not in trachea. Considering previous reports that hemagglutinins (HAs) of avian IAVs originally isolated from chicken bind preferentially to α2,3-Sia with or without fucosylation and/or 6-sulfation but not to α2,6-Sia, our results imply that avian IAVs do not evolve to possess HAs that bind preferentially to α2,6-Sia, regardless of the abundance of α2,6-Sia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on structural analysis of N-glycans in chicken tissues and their potential as receptors for influenza viruses, without explicit linking of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Dual Role of CCR5 in the Course of Influenza Infection: Exploring Treatment Opportunities.
Abstract: Influenza is one of the most relevant respiratory viruses to human health causing annual epidemics, and recurrent pandemics. Influenza disease is principally associated with inappropriate activation of the immune response. Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and its cognate chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are rapidly induced upon influenza infection, contributing to leukocyte recruitment into the airways and a consequent effective antiviral response. Here we discuss the existing evidence for CCR5 role in the host immune responses to influenza virus. Complete absence of CCR5 in mice revealed the receptor's role in coping with influenza <i>via</i> the recruitment of early memory CD8+ T cells, B cell activation and later recruitment of activated CD4+ T cells. Moreover, CCR5 contributes to inflammatory resolution by enhancing alveolar macrophages survival and reprogramming macrophages to pro-resolving phenotypes. In contrast, CCR5 activation is associated with excessive recruitment of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and NK cells in models of severe influenza pneumonia. The available data suggests that, while CCL5 can play a protective role in influenza infection, CCL3 may contribute to an overwhelming inflammatory process that can harm the lung tissue. In humans, the gene encoding CCR5 might contain a 32-base pair deletion, resulting in a truncated protein. While discordant data in literature regarding this CCR5 mutation and influenza severity, the association of CCR5delta32 and HIV resistance fostered the development of different CCR5 inhibitors, now being tested in lung inflammation therapy. The potential use of CCR5 inhibitors to modulate the inflammatory response in severe human influenza infections is to be addressed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses the role of CCR5 in immune response to influenza infection and potential treatment opportunities, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolution of Viral Pathogens Follows a Linear Order.
Abstract: Although lessons have been learned from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, the rapid evolution of the viruses means that future outbreaks of a much larger scale are possible, as shown by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses as well as viruses in general. This study reports a comparative analysis of the amino acid usage within several key viral families and genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks, including coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus-HKU1 [HCoV-HKU1], HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), flavivirus (dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and Zika) and ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo ebolavirus). Our analysis reveals that the distribution of amino acid usage in the viral genome is constrained to follow a linear order, and the distribution remains closely related to the viral species within the family or genus. This constraint can be adapted to predict viral mutations and future variants of concern. By studying previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we have adapted this naturally occurring pattern to determine that although pangolin plays a role in the outbreak of COVID-19, it may not be the sole agent as an intermediate animal. In addition to this study, our findings contribute to the understanding of viral mutations for subsequent development of vaccines and toward developing a model to determine the source of the outbreak. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study reports a comparative analysis of amino acid usage within several key viral genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks. Interestingly, there is evidence that the amino acid usage within the viral genomes is not random but in a linear order.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes amino acid usage patterns across viral families but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Antiviral Susceptibilities of Avian Influenza A(H5), A(H7), and A(H9) Viruses Isolated in Japan.
Abstract: The circulation of avian influenza A viruses in poultry is a public health concern due to the potential transmissibility and severity of these viral infections. Monitoring the susceptibility of these viruses to antivirals is important for developing measures to strengthen the level of preparedness against influenza pandemics. However, drug susceptibility information on these viruses is limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N8), A(H7N7), A(H7N9), A(H9N1), and A(H9N2) viruses isolated in Japan to the antivirals approved for use there: an M2 inhibitor (amantadine), neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir) and RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir and favipiravir). Genotypic methods that detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance and phenotypic methods that assess phenotypic viral susceptibility to drugs have revealed that these avian influenza A viruses are susceptible to neuraminidase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. These results suggest that neuraminidase and RNA polymerase inhibitors currently approved in Japan could be a treatment option against influenza A virus infections in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses antiviral susceptibilities of avian influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond resistance profiles.

Title: Safety, Immunogenicity, and Protective Efficacy of an H5N1 Chimeric Cold-Adapted Attenuated Virus Vaccine in a Mouse Model.
Abstract: H5N1 influenza virus is a threat to public health worldwide. The virus can cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans. We constructed an H5N1 influenza candidate virus vaccine from the A/chicken/Guizhou/1153/2016 strain that was recommended by the World Health Organization. In this study, we designed an H5N1 chimeric influenza A/B vaccine based on a cold-adapted (ca) influenza B virus B/Vienna/1/99 backbone. We modified the ectodomain of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) protein, while retaining the packaging signals of influenza B virus, and then rescued a chimeric cold-adapted H5N1 candidate influenza vaccine through a reverse genetic system. The chimeric H5N1 vaccine replicated well in eggs and the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. It maintained a temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted phenotype. The H5N1 vaccine was attenuated in mice. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies, micro-neutralizing (MN) antibodies, and IgG antibodies were induced in immunized mice, and the mucosal IgA antibody responses were detected in their lung lavage fluids. The IFN-γ-secretion and IL-4-secretion by the mouse splenocytes were induced after stimulation with the specific H5N1 HA protein. The chimeric H5N1 candidate vaccine protected mice against lethal challenge with a wild-type highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus. The chimeric H5 candidate vaccine is thus a potentially safe, attenuated, and reassortment-incompetent vaccine with circulating A viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Phylogenetic Analysis of H5N8 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Ukraine, 2016-2017.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) can be carried long distances by migratory wild birds and by poultry trade. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is often lethal in domestic poultry and can sporadically infect and cause severe respiratory or systemic disease in other species including humans. Since 2003, the H5 subtype of HPAIV have spread from epicenters in China to neighboring regions in East and Southeast Asia, and across Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent, Europe, Africa, and North America. Outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV struck poultry in Ukraine in 2005. In 2016, A H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIV outbreaks occurred in wild and domestic birds in Ukraine concurrently with outbreaks in Central Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. We report outbreaks of HPAI in domestic backyard poultry in (2016-2017) in the southern region of Ukraine, in proximity to mass gathering sites for migratory waterfowl including mute swans (<i>Cygnus olor</i>). All eight genome segments of three novel H5N8 HPAIV isolated in November 2016 from two domestic backyard chickens (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) and one backyard mallard duck (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) found dead of HPAI in Azov-Black Sea region of Ukraine were cladistically related to H5N8 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses isolated from wild shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadorna</i>) and white-fronted goose (<i>Anser albifrons</i>) in Askania Nova Biopreserve (Kherson district, Ukraine) in 2016-2017 and to other contemporary H5N8 HPAIV strains sequenced from wild birds and poultry in Eurasia. Amino acid variations in hemagglutinin were outside of the polybasic cleavage site (PLREKRRKR/GLF), and D224G suggested avian-like receptor binding specificity; neuraminidase did not have mutations characteristic of oseltamivir drug resistance. Outbreaks of HPAI in Ukraine highlight the continual need for biosurveillance and genomic sequencing of avian influenza viruses along wild bird flyways and interfaces with domestic poultry in Eurasia.

Title: Peering into Avian Influenza A(H5N8) for a Framework towards Pandemic Preparedness.
Abstract: 2014 marked the first emergence of avian influenza A(H5N8) in Jeonbuk Province, South Korea, which then quickly spread worldwide. In the midst of the 2020-2021 H5N8 outbreak, it spread to domestic poultry and wild waterfowl shorebirds, leading to the first human infection in Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. Despite being clinically asymptomatic and without direct human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization stressed the need for continued risk assessment given the nature of Influenza to reassort and generate novel strains. Given its promiscuity and easy cross to humans, the urgency to understand the mechanisms of possible species jumping to avert disastrous pandemics is increasing. Addressing the epidemiology of H5N8, its mechanisms of species jumping and its implications, mutational and reassortment libraries can potentially be built, allowing them to be tested on various models complemented with deep-sequencing and automation. With knowledge on mutational patterns, cellular pathways, drug resistance mechanisms and effects of host proteins, we can be better prepared against H5N8 and other influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses epidemiology, mechanisms of species jumping, and potential for mutational libraries but does not present explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Genetic Characterization of Novel H7Nx Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses from Wild Birds in South Korea during the Winter of 2020-2021.
Abstract: Zoonotic infection with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of subtype H7, such as H7N9 and H7N4, has raised concerns worldwide. During the winter of 2020-2021, five novel H7 low pathogenic AIVs (LPAIVs) containing different neuraminidase (NA) subtypes, including two H7N3, an H7N8, and two H7N9, were detected in wild bird feces in South Korea. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the novel H7Nx AIVs were reassortants containing two gene segments (hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix) that were related to the zoonotic Jiangsu-Cambodian H7 viruses causing zoonotic infection and six gene segments originating from LPAIVs circulating in migratory birds in Eurasia. A genomic constellation analysis demonstrated that all H7 isolates contained a mix of gene segments from different viruses, indicating that multiple reassortment occurred. The well-known mammalian adaptive substitution (E627K and D701N) in PB2 was not detected in any of these isolates. The detection of multiple reassortant H7Nx AIVs in wild birds highlights the need for intensive surveillance in both wild birds and poultry in Eurasia.

Title: Emergence, prevalence, and evolution of H5N8 avian influenza viruses in central China, 2020.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N8) viruses have caused several worldwide outbreaks in birds and are able cross the species barrier to infect humans, posing a substantial threat to public health. After the first detection of H5N8 viruses in deceased swans in Inner Mongolia, we performed early warning and active monitoring along swan migration routes in central China. We isolated and sequenced 42 avian influenza viruses, including 40 H5N8 viruses, 1 H5N2 virus, and 1 H9N2 virus, in central China. Our H5N8 viruses isolated in swan stopover sites and wintering grounds showed high nucleotide homologies in the whole genome, revealing a common evolutionary source. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b prevalent in 2020 have further diverged into two sub-clades: b1 and b2. The phylogeographic analysis also showed that the viruses of sub-clade b2 most likely originated from poultry in Russia. Notably, whooper swans were found to be responsible for the introduction of sub-clade b2 viruses in central China; whooper and tundra swans play a role in viral spread in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, respectively. Our findings highlight swans as an indicator species for transborder spreading and monitoring of the H5N8 virus.

Title: A cell-based multiplex immunoassay platform using fluorescent protein-barcoded reporter cell lines.
Abstract: Multiplex immunoassays with acellular antigens are well-established based on solid-phase platforms such as the Luminex<sup>®</sup> technology. Cell barcoding by amine-reactive fluorescent dyes enables analogous cell-based multiplex assays, but requires multiple labeling reactions and quality checks prior to every assay. Here we describe generation of stable, fluorescent protein-barcoded reporter cell lines suitable for multiplex screening of antibody to membrane proteins. The utility of this cell-based system, with the potential of a 256-plex cell panel, is demonstrated by flow cytometry deconvolution of barcoded cell panels expressing influenza A hemagglutinin trimers, or native human CCR2 or CCR5 multi-span proteins and their epitope-defining mutants. This platform will prove useful for characterizing immunity and discovering antibodies to membrane-associated proteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a multiplex immunoassay platform for antibody screening but does not discuss viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Two phytocompounds from Schinopsis brasiliensis show promising antiviral activity with multiples targets in Influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus, the main flu agent, affects billions of people worldwide. Conventional treatments still present limitations related to drug-resistance and severe side effects. As a result, natural product-derived molecules have been increasingly investigated as prospect drug candidates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible anti-flu activity and to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters, by in silico approaches, of the Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. phytochemical compounds. Nine phytocompounds and six antiviral drugs (Amantadine, Umifenovir, Favipiravir, Nitazoxanide, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir) were selected for the analyses against four Influenza A proteins: neuraminidase, polymerase basic protein 2, hemagglutinin and M2 ion channel protein. The molecular docking, the predicted antiviral activity, the predicted toxicity and the pharmacokinetics investigations were conducted. The obtained results demonstrated that Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone display promising in silico antiviral activity (binding energy < 5.0 and ≥ 9.0 kcal/mol) and safety (low toxicity than commercial anti-flu drugs). Overall, this study corroborated the hypothesis that S. brasiliensis barks extract has a biological activity against Influenza A virus. Additionally, Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone have multiple targets in Influenza A virus and showed themselves as the most promising phytocompounds to be isolated and considered for the therapeutic arsenal against the flu.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses in silico approaches to evaluate phytocompounds against influenza proteins but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Novel Recombinant Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Vaccine Candidate Stabilized by a Measles Virus Phosphoprotein Tetramerization Domain Provides Robust Protection from Virus Challenge in the Mouse Model.
Abstract: Current seasonal influenza virus vaccines do not induce robust immune responses to neuraminidase. Several factors, including immunodominance of hemagglutinin over neuraminidase, instability of neuraminidase in vaccine formulations, and variable, nonstandardized amounts of neuraminidase in the vaccines, may contribute to this effect. However, vaccines that induce strong antineuraminidase immune responses would be beneficial, as they are highly protective. Furthermore, antigenic drift is slower for neuraminidase than for hemagglutinin, potentially providing broader coverage. Here, we designed stabilized recombinant versions of neuraminidase by replacing the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane, and extracellular stalk with tetramerization domains from the measles or Sendai virus phosphoprotein or from an Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor. The measles virus tetramerization domain-based construct, termed N1-MPP, was chosen for further evaluation, as it retained antigenicity, neuraminidase activity, and structural integrity and provided robust protection <i>in vivo</i> against lethal virus challenge in the mouse model. We tested N1-MPP as a standalone vaccine, admixed with seasonal influenza virus vaccines, or given with seasonal influenza virus vaccines but in the other leg of the mouse. Admixture with different formulations of seasonal vaccines led to a weak neuraminidase response, suggesting a dominant effect of hemagglutinin over neuraminidase when administered in the same formulation. However, administration of neuraminidase alone or with seasonal vaccine administered in the alternate leg of the mouse induced robust antibody responses. Thus, this recombinant neuraminidase construct is a promising vaccine antigen that may enhance and broaden protection against seasonal influenza viruses. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza virus infections remain a high risk to human health, causing up to 650,000 deaths worldwide every year, with an enormous burden on the health care system. Since currently available seasonal vaccines are only partially effective and often mismatched to the circulating strains, a broader protective influenza virus vaccine is needed. Here, we generated a recombinant influenza virus vaccine candidate based on the more conserved neuraminidase surface glycoprotein in order to induce a robust and broader protective immune response against a variety of circulating influenza virus strains.

Reason: The paper focuses on vaccine design and immune response to neuraminidase but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Characterization of Swine Influenza A(H1N2) Variant, Alberta, Canada, 2020.
Abstract: Influenza strains circulating among swine populations can cause outbreaks in humans. In October 2020, we detected a variant influenza A subtype H1N2 of swine origin in a person in Alberta, Canada. We initiated a public health, veterinary, and laboratory investigation to identify the source of the infection and determine whether it had spread. We identified the probable source as a local pig farm where a household contact of the index patient worked. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate closely resembled strains found at that farm in 2017. Retrospective and prospective surveillance using molecular testing did not identify any secondary cases among 1,532 persons tested in the surrounding area. Quick collaboration between human and veterinary public health practitioners in this case enabled a rapid response to a potential outbreak.

Title: Interferon mediated prophylactic protection against respiratory viruses conferred by a prototype live attenuated influenza virus vaccine lacking non-structural protein 1.
Abstract: The influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known for its ability to hinder the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) during viral infection. Influenza viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ΔNS1 virus results in an antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that ΔNS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on ΔNS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.

Title: First human infection of avian influenza A(H5N6) virus reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic, February-March 2021.
Abstract: In March 2021, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) reported an avian influenza A(H5N6) virus infection in a 5-year-old child identified through sentinel surveillance. This was the first human A(H5N6) infection reported outside of China. A multidisciplinary investigation undertook contact tracing and enhanced human and animal surveillance in surrounding villages and live bird markets. Seven Muscovy ducks tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Sequenced viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4h and were closely related to viruses detected in poultry in Vietnam and to previous viruses detected in Laos. Surveillance and coordinated outbreak response remain essential to global health security.

Title: A simple model for how the risk of pandemics from different virus families depends on viral and human traits.
Abstract: Different virus families, like influenza or corona viruses, exhibit characteristic traits such as typical modes of transmission and replication as well as specific animal reservoirs in which each family of viruses circulate. These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population, and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of different virus families. A key trait of viruses that "spillover" from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a pandemic.

Reason: The paper presents a theoretical model relating viral traits to pandemic risk but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Age-Specific Etiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections and Influenza Vaccine Effectivity in Prevention of Hospitalization in Russia, 2018-2019 Season.
Abstract: The expansion and standardization of clinical trials, as well as the use of sensitive and specific molecular diagnostics methods, provide new information on the age-specific roles of influenza and other respiratory viruses in development of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Here, we present the results of the multicenter hospital-based study aimed to detect age-specific impact of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). The 2018-2019 influenza season in Russia was characterized by co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus subtypes which were detected among hospitalized patients with SARI in 19.3% and 16.4%, respectively. RSV dominated among ORV (15.1% of total cases and 26.8% in infants aged ≤ 2 years). The most significant SARI agents in intensive care units were RSV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, (37.3% and 25.4%, respectively, of PCR-positive cases). Hyperthermia was the most frequently registered symptom for influenza cases. In contrast, hypoxia, decreased blood O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and dyspnea were registered more often in RSV, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus infection in young children. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalization of patients with PCR-confirmed influenza was evaluated using test-negative case-control design. IVE for children and adults was estimated to be 57.0% and 62.0%, respectively. Subtype specific IVE was higher against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, compared to influenza A(H3N2) (60.3% and 45.8%, respectively). This correlates with delayed antigenic drift of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and genetic heterogeneity of the influenza A(H3N2) population. These studies demonstrate the need to improve seasonal influenza prevention and control in all countries as states by the WHO Global Influenza Strategy for 2019-2030 initiative.

Title: Characterizing the Countrywide Epidemic Spread of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Kenya between 2009 and 2018.
Abstract: The spatiotemporal patterns of spread of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses on a countrywide scale are unclear in many tropical/subtropical regions mainly because spatiotemporally representative sequence data are lacking. We isolated, sequenced, and analyzed 383 A(H1N1)pdm09 viral genomes from hospitalized patients between 2009 and 2018 from seven locations across Kenya. Using these genomes and contemporaneously sampled global sequences, we characterized the spread of the virus in Kenya over several seasons using phylodynamic methods. The transmission dynamics of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Kenya were characterized by (i) multiple virus introductions into Kenya over the study period, although only a few of those introductions instigated local seasonal epidemics that then established local transmission clusters, (ii) persistence of transmission clusters over several epidemic seasons across the country, (iii) seasonal fluctuations in effective reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>e</sub>) associated with lower number of infections and seasonal fluctuations in relative genetic diversity after an initial rapid increase during the early pandemic phase, which broadly corresponded to epidemic peaks in the northern and southern hemispheres, (iv) high virus genetic diversity with greater frequency of seasonal fluctuations in 2009-2011 and 2018 and low virus genetic diversity with relatively weaker seasonal fluctuations in 2012-2017, and (v) virus spread across Kenya. Considerable influenza virus diversity circulated within Kenya, including persistent viral lineages that were unique to the country, which may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within understudied low-to-middle-income tropical and subtropical regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of influenza viruses in humans and to inform vaccination strategies within these regions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the spatiotemporal spread and genetic diversity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Kenya, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Optimisation of Neuraminidase Expression for Use in Drug Discovery by Using HEK293-6E Cells.
Abstract: Influenza virus is a highly contagious virus that causes significant human mortality and morbidity annually. The most effective drugs for treating influenza are the neuraminidase inhibitors, but resistance to these inhibitors has emerged, and additional drug discovery research on neuraminidase and other targets is needed. Traditional methods of neuraminidase production from embryonated eggs are cumbersome, while insect cell derived protein is less reflective of neuraminidase produced during human infection. Herein we describe a method for producing neuraminidase from a human cell line, HEK293-6E, and demonstrate the method by producing the neuraminidase from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain. This method produced high levels of soluble neuraminidase expression (>3000 EU/mL), was enhanced by including a secretion signal from a viral chemokine binding protein, and does not require co-expression of additional proteins. The neuraminidase produced was of sufficient quantity and purity to support high resolution crystal structure determination. The structure solved using this protein conformed to the previously reported structure. Notably the glycosylation at three asparagine residues was superior in quality to that from insect cell derived neuraminidase. This method of production of neuraminidase should prove useful in further studies, such as the characterisation of inhibitor binding.

Reason: The paper describes a method for producing neuraminidase protein for drug discovery but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in 2019.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a record total of 9,266 human influenza positive samples during 2019. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or embryonated hen's eggs for potential use in seasonal influenza virus vaccines. In 2019, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated over influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, accounting for a total of 51% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2019. However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that a significant proportion of circulating A(H3N2) viruses had undergone genetic drift relative to the WHO recommended vaccine strain for 2019. Of 5,301 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition with oseltamivir, one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition with zanamivir and three B/Victoria viruses showed highly reduced inhibition with zanamivir.

Title: Evaluation of Next-Generation H3 Influenza Vaccines in Ferrets Pre-Immune to Historical H3N2 Viruses.
Abstract: Each person has a unique immune history to past influenza virus infections. Exposure to influenza viruses early in life establishes memory B cell populations that influence future immune responses to influenza vaccination. Current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies that are typically strain specific and do not offer broad protection against antigenically drifted influenza strains in all age groups of people. This is particularly true for vaccine antigens of the A(H3N2) influenza virus subtype, where continual antigenic drift necessitates frequent vaccine reformulation. Broadly-reactive influenza virus vaccine antigens offer a solution to combat antigenic drift, but they also need to be equally effective in all populations, regardless of prior influenza virus exposure history. This study examined the role that pre-existing immunity plays on influenza virus vaccination. Ferrets were infected with historical A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated from either the 1970's, 1980's, or 1990's and then vaccinated with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) or wild-type (WT) influenza virus like particles (VLPs) expressing hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine antigens to examine the expansion of immune breadth. Vaccines with the H3 COBRA HA antigens had more cross-reactive antibodies following a single vaccination in all three pre-immune regimens than vaccines with WT H3 HA antigens against historical, contemporary, and future drifted A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The H3 COBRA HA vaccines also induced antibodies capable of neutralizing live virus infections against modern drifted A(H3N2) strains at higher titers than the WT H3 HA vaccine comparators.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on vaccine evaluation and immune response in ferrets pre-immune to historical H3N2 viruses, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Global epidemiology of Equine Influenza viruses; "A possible emerging zoonotic threat in future" an extensive systematic review with evidence.
Abstract: There are different opinions around the World regarding the zoonotic capability of H3N8 equine influenza viruses. In this report, we have tried to summarize the findings of different research and review articles from Chinese, English, and Mongolian Scientific Literature reporting the evidence for equine influenza virus infections in human beings. Different search engines i.e. CNKI, PubMed, ProQuest, Chongqing Database, Mongol Med, and Web of Knowledge yielded 926 articles, of which 32 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Analyzing the epidemiological and Phylogenetic data from these articles, we found a considerable experimental and observational evidence of H3N8 equine influenza viruses infecting human being in different parts of the World in the past. Recently published articles from Pakistan and China have highlighted the emerging threat and capability of equine influenza viruses for an epidemic in human beings in future. In this review article we have summarized the salient scientific reports published on the epidemiology of equine influenza viruses and their zoonotic aspect. Additionally, several recent developments in the start of 21st century, including the transmission and establishment of equine influenza viruses in different animal species i.e. camels and dogs, and presumed encephalopathy associated to influenza viruses in horses, have documented the unpredictable nature of equine influenza viruses. In sum up, several reports has highlighted the unpredictable nature of H3N8 EIVs highlighting the need of continuous surveillance for H3N8 in equines and humans in contact with them for novel and threatening mutations.

Title: Temporal Dynamics of Influenza A(H5N1) Subtype before and after the Emergence of H5N8.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to circulate worldwide, causing numerous outbreaks among bird species and severe public health concerns. H5N1 and H5N8 are the two most fundamental HPAI subtypes detected in birds in the last two decades. The two viruses may compete with each other while sharing the same host population and, thus, suppress the spread of one of the viruses. In this study, we performed a statistical analysis to investigate the temporal correlation of the HPAI H5N1 and HPAI H5N8 subtypes using globally reported data in 2015-2020. This was joined with an in-depth analysis using data generated via our national surveillance program in Egypt. A total of 6412 outbreaks were reported worldwide during this period, with 39% (2529) as H5N1 and 61% (3883) as H5N8. In Egypt, 65% of positive cases were found in backyards, while only 12% were found in farms and 23% in live bird markets. Overall, our findings depict a trade-off between the number of positive H5N1 and H5N8 samples around early 2017, which is suggestive of the potential replacement between the two subtypes. Further research is still required to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms of this competitive dynamic. This, in turn, will implicate the design of effective strategies for disease control.

Title: Live Bird Markets in Nigeria: A Potential Reservoir for H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Since 2006, multiple outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have been reported in Nigeria involving different subtypes. Surveillance and molecular epidemiology have revealed the vital role of live bird markets (LBMs) in the dissemination of AI virus to commercial poultry farms. To better understand the ecology and epidemiology of AI in Nigeria, we performed whole-genome sequencing of nineteen H9N2 viruses recovered, from apparently healthy poultry species, during active surveillance conducted in nine LBMs across Nigeria in 2019. Analyses of the HA gene segment of these viruses showed that the H9N2 strains belong to the G1 lineage, which has zoonotic potential, and are clustered with contemporary H9N2 identified in Africa between 2016 and 2020. We observed two distinct clusters of H9N2 viruses in Nigeria, suggesting different introductions into the country. In view of the zoonotic potential of H9N2 and the co-circulation of multiple subtypes of AI virus in Nigeria, continuous monitoring of the LBMs across the country and molecular characterization of AIVs identified is advocated to mitigate economic losses and public health threats.

Title: Molecular Characterization of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses H5N6 Detected in Denmark in 2018-2019.
Abstract: Beginning in late 2017, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 viruses caused outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in several European countries. H5N6 viruses were detected in 43 wild birds found dead throughout Denmark. Most of the Danish virus-positive dead birds were found in the period from February to April 2018. However, unlike the rest of Europe, sporadic HPAI H5N6-positive dead wild birds were detected in Denmark in July, August, September, and December 2018, with the last positive bird being found in January 2019. HPAI viruses were not detected in active surveillance of apparently healthy wild birds. In this study, we use full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to investigate the wild bird HPAI H5N6 viruses found in Denmark. The Danish viruses were found to be closely related to those of contemporary HPAI H5N6 viruses detected in Europe. Their sequences formed two clusters indicating that at least two or more introductions of H5N6 into Denmark occurred. Notably, all viruses detected in the latter half of 2018 and in 2019 grouped into the same cluster. The H5N6 viruses appeared to have been maintained undetected in the autumn 2018.

Title: Novel reassortant 2.3.4.4B H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating among wild, domestic birds in Xinjiang, Northwest China.
Abstract: The H5 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of clade 2.3.4.4 circulate in wild and domestic birds worldwide. In 2017, nine strains of H5N6 AIVs were isolated from aquatic poultry in Xinjiang, Northwest China. This study aimed to analyze the origin, reassortment, and mutations of the AIV isolates. AIVs were isolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of poultry. Identification was accomplished by inoculating isolates into embryonated chicken eggs and performing hemagglutination tests and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The viral genomes were amplified with RT-PCR and then sequenced. The sequence alignment, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristic analyses were performed by using bioinformatic software. Nine isolates originated from the same ancestor. The viral <i>HA</i> gene belonged to clade 2.3.4.4B, while the <i>NA</i> gene had a close phylogenetic relationship with the 2.3.4.4C H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated from shoveler ducks in Ningxia in 2015. The <i>NP</i> gene was grouped into an independent subcluster within the 2.3.4.4B H5N8 AIVs, and the remaining six genes all had close phylogenetic relationships with the 2.3.4.4B H5N8 HPAIVs isolated from the wild birds in China, Egypt, Uganda, Cameroon, and India in 2016-2017, Multiple basic amino acid residues associated with HPAIVs were located adjacent to the cleavage site of the HA protein. The nine isolates comprised reassortant 2.3.4.4B HPAIVs originating from 2.3.4.4B H5N8 and 2.3.4.4C H5N6 viruses in wild birds. These results suggest that the Northern Tianshan Mountain wetlands in Xinjiang may have a key role in AIVs disseminating from Central China to the Eurasian continent and East African.

Title: The Crossroads between Host Copper Metabolism and Influenza Infection.
Abstract: Three main approaches are used to combat severe viral respiratory infections. The first is preemptive vaccination that blocks infection. Weakened or dead viral particles, as well as genetic constructs carrying viral proteins or information about them, are used as an antigen. However, the viral genome is very evolutionary labile and changes continuously. Second, chemical agents are used during infection and inhibit the function of a number of viral proteins. However, these drugs lose their effectiveness because the virus can rapidly acquire resistance to them. The third is the search for points in the host metabolism the effect on which would suppress the replication of the virus but would not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the host. Here, we consider the possibility of using the copper metabolic system as a target to reduce the severity of influenza infection. This is facilitated by the fact that, in mammals, copper status can be rapidly reduced by silver nanoparticles and restored after their cancellation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host copper metabolism and its impact on influenza infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: An Overview of Equine Influenza in South America.
Abstract: Equine influenza virus (EIV) is one of the most important respiratory pathogens of horses as outbreaks of the disease lead to significant economic losses worldwide. In this review, we summarize the information available on equine influenza (EI) in South America. In the region, the major events of EI occurred almost in the same period in the different countries, and the EIV isolated showed high genetic identity at the hemagglutinin gene level. It is highly likely that the continuous movement of horses, some of them subclinically infected, among South American countries, facilitated the spread of the virus. Although EI vaccination is mandatory for mobile or congregates equine populations in the region, EI outbreaks continuously threaten the equine industry. Vaccine breakdown could be related to the fact that many of the commercial vaccines available in the region contain out-of-date EIV strains, and some of them even lack reliable information about immunogenicity and efficacy.

Title: N-Glycolylneuraminic Acid in Animal Models for Human Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The first step in influenza virus infection is the binding of hemagglutinin to sialic acid-containing glycans present on the cell surface. Over 50 different sialic acid modifications are known, of which N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the two main species. Animal models with α2,6 linked Neu5Ac in the upper respiratory tract, similar to humans, are preferred to enable and mimic infection with unadapted human influenza A viruses. Animal models that are currently most often used to study human influenza are mice and ferrets. Additionally, guinea pigs, cotton rats, Syrian hamsters, tree shrews, domestic swine, and non-human primates (macaques and marmosets) are discussed. The presence of NeuGc and the distribution of sialic acid linkages in the most commonly used models is summarized and experimentally determined. We also evaluated the role of Neu5Gc in infection using Neu5Gc binding viruses and cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH)<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice, which lack Neu5Gc and concluded that Neu5Gc is unlikely to be a decoy receptor. This article provides a base for choosing an appropriate animal model. Although mice are one of the most favored models, they are hardly naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses, possibly because they express mainly α2,3 linked sialic acids with both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc modifications. We suggest using ferrets, which resemble humans closely in the sialic acid content, both in the linkages and the lack of Neu5Gc, lung organization, susceptibility, and disease pathogenesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses sialic acid modifications in animal models and their relevance to influenza infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Intra-species sialic acid polymorphism in humans: a common niche for influenza and coronavirus pandemics?
Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 159 million confirmed cases with over 3.3 million deaths worldwide, but it remains mystery why most infected individuals (∼98%) were asymptomatic or only experienced mild illness. The same mystery applies to the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which has puzzled the field for a century. Here we discuss dual potential properties of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic viruses that led to the high fatality rate in the small portion of severe cases, while about 98% infected persons in the United States were self-limited with mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic. These variations now have been postulated to be impacted by polymorphisms of the sialic acid receptors in the general population. Since coronaviruses (CoVs) also recognize sialic acid receptors and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and pandemics, similar principles of influenza virus evolution and pandemicity may also apply to CoVs. A potential common principle of pathogen/host co-evolution of influenza and CoVs under selection of host sialic acids in parallel with different epidemic and pandemic influenza and coronaviruses is discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses host sialic acid polymorphisms and their potential impact on influenza and coronavirus pandemics but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Immunomodulatory CEA Cell Adhesion Molecule 6 (CEACAM6/CD66c) Is a Protein Receptor for the Influenza a Virus.
Abstract: To establish a productive infection in host cells, viruses often use one or multiple host membrane glycoproteins as their receptors. For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein, binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found that CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs. This publication is the first to report CD66c (Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 6 or CEACAM6) as a glycoprotein receptor for Influenza A virus.

Title: Nanoparticle composite TPNT1 is effective against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.
Abstract: A metal nanoparticle composite, namely TPNT1, which contains Au-NP (1 ppm), Ag-NP (5 ppm), ZnO-NP (60 ppm) and ClO<sub>2</sub> (42.5 ppm) in aqueous solution was prepared and characterized by spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering analysis and potentiometric titration. Based on the in vitro cell-based assay, TPNT1 inhibited six major clades of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with effective concentration within the range to be used as food additives. TPNT1 was shown to block viral entry by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to interfere with the syncytium formation. In addition, TPNT1 also effectively reduced the cytopathic effects induced by human (H1N1) and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, including the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus isolates. Together with previously demonstrated efficacy as antimicrobials, TPNT1 can block viral entry and inhibit or prevent viral infection to provide prophylactic effects against both SARS-CoV-2 and opportunistic infections.

Title: Dynamic Pneumococcal Genetic Adaptations Support Bacterial Growth and Inflammation during Coinfection with Influenza.
Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is one of the primary bacterial pathogens that complicates influenza virus infections. These bacterial coinfections increase influenza-associated morbidity and mortality through a number of immunological and viral-mediated mechanisms, but the specific bacterial genes that contribute to postinfluenza pathogenicity are not known. Here, we used genome-wide transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to reveal bacterial genes that confer improved fitness in influenza virus-infected hosts. The majority of the 32 genes identified are involved in bacterial metabolism, including nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, protein translation, and membrane transport. We generated mutants with single-gene deletions (SGD) of five of the genes identified, SPD1414, SPD2047 (<i>cbiO1</i>), SPD0058 (<i>purD</i>), SPD1098, and SPD0822 (<i>proB</i>), to investigate their effects on <i>in vivo</i> fitness, disease severity, and host immune responses. The growth of the SGD mutants was slightly attenuated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, but each still grew to high titers in the lungs of mock- and influenza virus-infected hosts. Despite high bacterial loads, mortality was significantly reduced or delayed with all SGD mutants. Time-dependent reductions in pulmonary neutrophils, inflammatory macrophages, and select proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also observed. Immunohistochemical staining further revealed altered neutrophil distribution with reduced degeneration in the lungs of influenza virus-SGD mutant-coinfected animals. These studies demonstrate a critical role for specific bacterial genes and for bacterial metabolism in driving virulence and modulating immune function during influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on bacterial gene adaptations during influenza coinfection, not viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: A comprehensive influenza reporter virus panel for high-throughput deep profiling of neutralizing antibodies.
Abstract: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been developed as potential countermeasures for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Deep characterization of these bnAbs and polyclonal sera provides pivotal understanding for influenza immunity and informs effective vaccine design. However, conventional virus neutralization assays require high-containment laboratories and are difficult to standardize and roboticize. Here, we build a panel of engineered influenza viruses carrying a reporter gene to replace an essential viral gene, and develop an assay using the panel for in-depth profiling of neutralizing antibodies. Replication of these viruses is restricted to cells expressing the missing viral gene, allowing it to be manipulated in a biosafety level 2 environment. We generate the neutralization profile of 24 bnAbs using a 55-virus panel encompassing the near-complete diversity of human H1N1 and H3N2, as well as pandemic subtype viruses. Our system offers in-depth profiling of influenza immunity, including the antibodies against the hemagglutinin stem, a major target of universal influenza vaccines.

Title: First case of acute cholestatic hepatitis attributed to oseltamivir in a young girl with ah1n1 influenza.
Abstract: Oseltamivir caryboxylase is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme neuramidase of the influenza virus particle and it is active against both influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir is indicated for therapy or post-exposure prevention of influenza A and B. Side effects are uncommon and include mild nausea, gastrointestinal upset, dizziness and headache. Despite its widespread use, oseltamivir has not been associated with clinically apparent liver injury. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature linking the development of acute hepatitis to the consumption of oseltamivir in a patient suffering from influenza H1N1 infection.

Title: SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, an experimental set-up is used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses cause a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmits efficiently. Serological assays confirm all virus transmission events. Although the experiments do not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for virus transmission via the air between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on transmission experiments of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Virus sensing receptors in cellular infectivity of influenza A virus.
Abstract: An innate immune response is essential to mobilize protective immunity upon the infection of respiratory epithelial cells with influenza A virus (IAV). The response is classified as early (nonspecific effectors), local systematic (effector cells recruitment) and late (antigen to lymphoid organ transport, naive B and T cells recognition, effector cells clonal expansion and differentiation). Virus particles are detected by the host cells as non-self by various sensors that are present on the cell surface, endosomes and cytosol. These sensors are collectively termed as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs distinguish unique molecular signatures known as pathogen-associated molecular pattern, which are present either on the cell surface or within intracellular compartments. PRRs have been classified into five major groups: C-Type Lectin Receptor (CLR), Toll-like receptor (TLR), Nod-like receptor (NLR), Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptor (RLR), which play a role in innate immunity to IAV infection, and the pyrin and hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (PYHIN) domain protein. Here, we discuss the role of PRRs in cellular infectivity of IAV and highlight the recent progress.

Title: Influenza and Influenza Vaccine: A Review.
Abstract: Influenza is a highly contagious, deadly virus, killing nearly half a million people yearly worldwide. The classic symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, cough, and body aches. In the outpatient setting, diagnosis can be made by clinical presentation with optional confirmatory diagnostic testing. Antiviral medications should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of initiation of symptoms. The primary preventive measure against influenza is vaccination, which is recommended for all people 6 months of age or older, including pregnant and postpartum women, unless the individual has a contraindication. Vaccination should occur at the beginning of flu season, which typically begins in October. It takes approximately 14 days after vaccination for a healthy adult to reach peak antibody protection. There are challenges associated with vaccine composition and vaccine uptake. It takes approximately 6 to 8 months to identify and predict which influenza strains to include in the upcoming season's vaccine. During this time, the influenza virus may undergo antigenic drift, that is, mutating to avoid a host immune response. Antigenic drift makes the vaccine less effective in some seasons. The influenza virus occasionally undergoes antigenic shift, in which it changes to a novel virus, creating potential for a pandemic. There are also barriers to vaccine uptake, including lack of or limited access to care and misconceptions about receiving the vaccine. Interventions that improve access to and uptake of the influenza vaccine must be initiated, targeting multiple levels, including health care policy, patients, health care systems, and the health care team. This article reviews information about influenza identification, management, and prevention.

Title: Earliest detection to date of SARS-CoV-2 in Florida: Identification together with influenza virus on the main entry door of a university building, February 2020.
Abstract: In February and March, 2020, environmental surface swab samples were collected from the handle of the main entry door of a major university building in Florida, as part of a pilot surveillance project screening for influenza. Samples were taken at the end of regular classroom hours, between the dates of February 1-5 and February 19-March 4, 2020. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was isolated from the door handle on four of the 19 days sampled. Both SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in a sample collected on February 21, 2020. Based on sequence analysis, the Florida SARS-CoV-2 strain (designated UF-11) was identical to strains being identified in Washington state during the same time period, while the earliest similar sequences were sampled in China/Hubei between Dec 30th 2019 and Jan 5th 2020. The first human case of COVID-19 was not officially reported in Florida until March 1st. In an analysis of sequences from COVID-19 patients in this region of Florida, there was only limited evidence of subsequent dissemination of the UF-11 strain. Identical or highly similar strains, possibly related through a common transmission chain, were detected with increasing frequency in Washington state between end of February and beginning of March. Our data provide further documentation of the rapid early spread of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the likelihood that closely related strains were cryptically circulating in multiple U.S. communities before the first "official" cases were recognized.

Title: Assessment of Maternal and Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load, Transplacental Antibody Transfer, and Placental Pathology in Pregnancies During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Abstract: Biological data are lacking with respect to risk of vertical transmission and mechanisms of fetoplacental protection in maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal and neonatal biofluids, transplacental passage of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and incidence of fetoplacental infection. This cohort study was conducted among pregnant women presenting for care at 3 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Women with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results positive for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from April 2 to June 13, 2020, and follow-up occurred through July 10, 2020. Contemporaneous participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as a convenience sample from pregnant women with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, defined by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. The main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal plasma or respiratory fluids and umbilical cord plasma, quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in maternal and cord plasma, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the placenta. Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 with RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [5.6] years) and 63 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [5.4] years) provided samples for analysis. Of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) were asymptomatic, 22 (34%) had mild disease, 7 (11%) had moderate disease, 10 (16%) had severe disease, and 2 (3%) had critical disease. In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested in whom SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified in cord blood, 1 had detectable immunoglobuilin M to nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any. In antibody analyses among 37 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G was detected in 24 women (65%) and anti-nucleocapsid was detected in 26 women (70%). Mother-to-neonate transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower than transfer of anti-influenza hemagglutinin A antibodies (mean [SD] cord-to-maternal ratio: anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G, 0.72 [0.57]; anti-nucleocapsid, 0.74 [0.44]; anti-influenza, 1.44 [0.80]; P < .001). Nonoverlapping placental expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 was noted. In this cohort study, there was no evidence of placental infection or definitive vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was inefficient. Lack of viremia and reduced coexpression and colocalization of placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve as protective mechanisms against vertical transmission.

Title: Metagenomic characterisation of additional and novel avian viruses from Australian wild ducks.
Abstract: Birds, notably wild ducks, are reservoirs of pathogenic and zoonotic viruses such as influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the current study, we used metagenomics to detect and characterise avian DNA and RNA viruses from wild Pacific black ducks, Chestnut teals and Grey teals collected at different time points from a single location. We characterised a likely new species of duck aviadenovirus and a novel duck gyrovirus. We also report what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first finding of an avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black ducks and a rotavirus F from Chestnut teals. Other viruses characterised from the samples from these wild ducks belong to the virus families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae. Some of the viruses may have potential cross-species transmissibility, while others indicated a wide genetic diversity of duck viruses within a genus. The study also showed evidence of potential transmission of viruses along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway; potentially facilitated by migrating shorebirds. The detection and characterisation of several avian viruses not previously described, and causing asymptomatic but potentially also symptomatic infections suggest the need for more virus surveillance studies for pathogenic and potential zoonotic viruses in wildlife reservoirs.

Title: H1 Hemagglutinin Priming Provides Long-Lasting Heterosubtypic Immunity against H5N1 Challenge in the Mouse Model.
Abstract: Influenza virus infections leave a signature of immune memory that influences future responses to infections with antigenically related strains. It has been hypothesized that the first exposure in life to H1N1 influenza virus imprints the host immune system, potentially resulting in protection from severe infection with H5N1 later in life through hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-specific antibodies. To study the specific role of the HA on protection against infection without interference of cellular immunity or humoral antineuraminidase immunity, we primed mice with influenza B viruses that express an H1 HA (group 1; B-H1), H3 HA (group 2; B-H3), or wild-type influenza B virus and subsequently challenged them at different time points with an H5N1 virus. Weight loss and survival monitoring showed that the B-H1-primed mice exhibited better protection against H5N1 compared to the control mice. Analysis of H5-specific serum IgG, before and 21 days after H5N1 challenge, evidenced the presence of anti-stalk H5 cross-reactive antibodies in the BH-1 group that were boosted by H5N1 infection. The increased immune responses and protection induced by priming with the B-H1 viruses lasted at least up to 1 year. Hence, a single HA priming based on natural infection induces long-lasting protective immunity against heterosubtypic strains from the same phylogenetic HA group in mice. This study gives mechanistic support to the earlier finding in humans that imprinting by H1 HA protects against H5N1 infections and that highly conserved regions on the HA, like the stalk, are involved in this phenomenon.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Current studies point out that an HA-mediated immunological imprint is established early in life during the first exposure to influenza viruses, which critically shapes and biases future immune responses. However, studies in animal models are limited and the precise mechanisms of this phenomenon are under investigation. Studies that explore the effect of HA-specific immunity induced during natural infection on future exposures to heterosubtypic influenza strains are needed.

Title: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Clade 2.3.4.4b Subtype H5N8 Virus Isolated from Mandarin Duck in South Korea, 2020.
Abstract: In October 2020, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N8 virus was identified from a fecal sample of a wild mandarin duck (<i>Aix galericulata</i>) in South Korea. We sequenced all eight genome segments of the virus, designated as A/Mandarin duck/Korea/K20-551-4/2020(H5N8), and conducted genetic characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis to track its origin. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis show that the hemagglutinin gene belongs to H5 clade 2.3.4.4 subgroup B. All genes share high levels of nucleotide identity with H5N8 HPAI viruses identified from Europe during early 2020. Enhanced active surveillance in wild and domestic birds is needed to monitor the introduction and spread of HPAI via wild birds and to inform the design of improved prevention and control strategies.

Title: Characterising the epidemic spread of influenza A/H3N2 within a city through phylogenetics.
Abstract: Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. While we did not find that transmission dynamics in Basel correlate with humidity or school closures, we did find some evidence that it may positively correlated with temperature. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network. In the remaining transmission network, our analyses suggest that school-aged children likely play a more central role than pre-school aged children. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.
Relevant: False

Title: Asynchrony between virus diversity and antibody selection limits influenza virus evolution.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza viruses create a persistent global disease burden by evolving to escape immunity induced by prior infections and vaccinations. New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter well-matched mucosal antibodies in previously-infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within-host. They also suggest new avenues for improving influenza control.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a theoretical model of virus evolution and immune selection without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza Hemagglutinin Head Domain Mimicry by Rational Design.
Abstract: Despite diligent vaccination efforts, influenza virus infection remains a major cause for respiratory-related illness across the globe. The less-than-optimal immunity conferred by the currently prescribed seasonal vaccines and protracted production times warrant the development of novel vaccines. Induction of an epitope-focused antibody response targeting known neutralization epitopes is a viable strategy to enhance the breadth of protection against rapidly evolving infectious viruses. We report the development of a design framework to mimic the hemagglutinin (HA) head fragment of H1-subtype viruses by delineating the interaction network of invariant residues lining the receptor binding site (RBS); a site targeted by cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. The incorporation of multiple sequence alignment information in our algorithm to fix the construct termini and engineer rational mutations facilitates the facile extension of the design to heterologous (subtype-specific) influenza strains. We evaluated our design protocol by generating head fragments from divergent influenza A H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and pH1N1 A/California/07/2009 strains that share a sequence identity of only 74.4% within the HA1 subunit. The designed immunogens exhibited characteristics of a well-ordered protein, and bound conformation-specific RBS targeting antibodies with high affinity, a desirable feature for putative vaccine candidates. Additionally, the bacterial expression of these immunogens provides a low-cost, rapidly scalable alternative.

Title: Pathology of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus of clade 2.3.2.1a in turkeys in Bangladesh.
Abstract: A mixed-aged flock of 130 turkeys in Bangladesh reported the sudden death of 1 bird in September 2017. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in 3 turkeys, and phylogenetic analysis placed the viruses in the reassortant clade 2.3.2.1a. The birds had clinical signs of depression, diarrhea, weakness, closed eyes, and finally death. The mortality rate of the flock was 13% over the 6 d prior to the flock being euthanized. At autopsy, we observed congestion in lungs and brain, hemorrhages in the trachea, pancreas, breast muscle, coronary fat, intestine, bursa of Fabricius, and kidneys. Histopathology revealed hemorrhagic pneumonia, hemorrhages in the liver and kidneys, and hemorrhages and necrosis in the spleen and pancreas. Significant changes in the brain included gliosis, focal encephalomalacia and encephalitis, and neuronophagia.

Title: In Vitro Combinations of Baloxavir Acid and Other Inhibitors against Seasonal Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Two antiviral classes, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) can be used to prevent and treat influenza infections during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. However, prolonged treatment may lead to the emergence of drug resistance. Therapeutic combinations constitute an alternative to prevent resistance and reduce antiviral doses. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro combinations of baloxavir acid (BXA) and other approved drugs against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) subtypes. The determination of an effective concentration inhibiting virus cytopathic effects by 50% (EC50) for each drug and combination indexes (CIs) were based on cell viability. CompuSyn software was used to determine synergism, additivity or antagonism between drugs. Combinations of BXA and NAIs or favipiravir had synergistic effects on cell viability against the two influenza A subtypes. Those effects were confirmed using a physiological and predictive ex vivo reconstructed human airway epithelium model. On the other hand, the combination of BXA and ribavirin showed mixed results. Overall, BXA stands as a good candidate for combination with several existing drugs, notably oseltamivir and favipiravir, to improve in vitro antiviral activity. These results should be considered for further animal and clinical evaluations.

Reason: The study evaluates in vitro drug combination effects on influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Mutation Network Method for Transmission Analysis of Human Influenza H3N2.
Abstract: Characterizing the spatial transmission pattern is critical for better surveillance and control of human influenza. Here, we propose a mutation network framework that utilizes network theory to study the transmission of human influenza H3N2. On the basis of the mutation network, the transmission analysis captured the circulation pattern from a global simulation of human influenza H3N2. Furthermore, this method was applied to explore, in detail, the transmission patterns within Europe, the United States, and China, revealing the regional spread of human influenza H3N2. The mutation network framework proposed here could facilitate the understanding, surveillance, and control of other infectious diseases.

Title: Avian Influenza Virus Prevalence and Subtype Diversity in Wild Birds in Shanghai, China, 2016-2018.
Abstract: From 2016 to 2018, surveillance of influenza A viruses in wild birds was conducted in Shanghai, located at the East Asian-Australian flyway, China. A total of 5112 samples from 51 species of wild birds were collected from three different wetlands. The total three-year prevalence of influenza A viruses among them was 8.8%, as assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, and the total prevalence was higher in Anseriformes (26.3%) than in the Charadriiformes (2.3%) and the other orders (2.4%) in the Chongmin wetlands. Anseriformes should be the key monitoring group in future surveillance efforts. The peak prevalence of influenza A viruses in Charadriiformes were in April and September, and in other bird orders, the peaks were in November and December. Twelve subtypes of haemagglutinin (HA; H1-H12) and eight subtypes of neuraminidase (NA; N1, N2, N4-N9) were identified in 21 different combinations. The greatest subtype diversity could be found in common teal, suggesting that this species of the bird might play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of influenza A viruses in Shanghai. These results will increase our understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of influenza A viruses in wild bird hosts in eastern China, and provide references for subsequent surveillance of influenza A virus in wild birds in this area.

Reason: The paper focuses on prevalence and subtype diversity of avian influenza viruses in wild birds without linking specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian Influenza Viruses Detected in Birds in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: In the recent past, sub-Saharan Africa has not escaped the devastating effects of avian influenza virus (AIV) in poultry and wild birds. This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past two decades (2000-2019). We collected data from three electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1% to 7.1%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 5.237, <i>p</i> = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, <i>p</i> = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8 and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1 and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.

Title: Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal in Measurably Evolving Populations.
Abstract: Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal in sequence data, a methodological study without direct genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Log Transformation Improves Dating of Phylogenies.
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees inferred from sequence data often have branch lengths measured in the expected number of substitutions and therefore, do not have divergence times estimated. These trees give an incomplete view of evolutionary histories since many applications of phylogenies require time trees. Many methods have been developed to convert the inferred branch lengths from substitution unit to time unit using calibration points, but none is universally accepted as they are challenged in both scalability and accuracy under complex models. Here, we introduce a new method that formulates dating as a nonconvex optimization problem where the variance of log-transformed rate multipliers is minimized across the tree. On simulated and real data, we show that our method, wLogDate, is often more accurate than alternatives and is more robust to various model assumptions.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methodological paper on phylogenetic dating methods, not linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antigenicity prediction and vaccine recommendation of human influenza virus A (H3N2) using convolutional neural networks.
Abstract: The rapid evolution of influenza A viruses poses a great challenge to vaccine development. Analytical and machine learning models have been applied to facilitate the process of antigenicity determination. In this study, we designed deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict Influenza antigenicity. Our model is the first that systematically analyzed 566 amino acid properties and 141 amino acid substitution matrices for their predictability. We then optimized the structure of the CNNs using particle swarm optimization. The optimal neural networks outperform other predictive models with a blind validation accuracy of 95.8%. Further, we applied our model to vaccine recommendations in the period 1997 to 2011 and contrasted the performance of previous vaccine recommendations using traditional experimental approaches. The results show that our model outperforms the WHO recommendation and other existing models and could potentially improve the vaccine recommendation process. Our results show that WHO often selects virus strains with small variation from year to year and learns slowly and recovers once coverage dips very low. In contrast, the influenza strains selected via our CNN model can differ quite drastically from year to year and exhibit consistently good coverage. In summary, we have designed a comprehensive computational pipeline for optimizing a CNN in the modeling of Influenza A antigenicity and vaccine recommendation. It is more cost and time-effective when compared to traditional hemagglutination inhibition assay analysis. The modeling framework is flexible and can be adopted to study other type of viruses.

Reason: This paper focuses on computational prediction of antigenicity using neural networks without direct experimental linking of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Impaired phagocytic function in CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages prevents muscle recovery after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia in old mice.
Abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction in survivors of pneumonia disproportionately affects older individuals in whom it causes substantial morbidity. We found that skeletal muscle recovery was impaired in old compared with young mice after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. In young mice, recovery of muscle loss was associated with expansion of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages and downregulation of MHC II expression, followed by a proliferation of muscle satellite cells. These findings were absent in old mice and in mice deficient in Cx3cr1. Transcriptomic profiling of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages from old compared with young mice showed downregulation of pathways associated with phagocytosis and proteostasis, and persistent upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Consistently, skeletal muscle macrophages from old mice failed to downregulate MHCII expression during recovery from influenza A virus-induced pneumonia and showed impaired phagocytic function in vitro. Like old animals, mice deficient in the phagocytic receptor Mertk showed no macrophage expansion, MHCII downregulation, or satellite cell proliferation and failed to recover skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia. Our data suggest that a loss of phagocytic function in a CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophage population in old mice precludes satellite cell proliferation and recovery of skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia.

Title: Controlling Avian Influenza Virus in Bangladesh: Challenges and Recommendations.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) remains a huge challenge for poultry production with negative repercussions for micro- and macro-economy and public health in Bangladesh. High (HP) H5N1 and low pathogenicity (LP) H9N2 AIV are currently endemic in poultry, and both have been reported to infect humans sporadically. Multiple virus introductions of different clades of HPAIV H5N1, reassorted genotypes, and on-going diversification of LPAIV H9N2 create a highly volatile virological environment which potentially implicates increased virulence, adaptation to new host species, and subsequent zoonotic transmission. Allotropy of poultry rearing systems and supply chains further increase the risk of virus spreading, which leads to human exposure and fosters the emergence of new potentially pre-pandemic virus strains. Here, we review the epidemiology, focusing on (i) risk factors for virus spreading, (ii) viral genetic evolution, and (iii) options for AIV control in Bangladesh. It is concluded that improved control strategies would profit from the integration of various intervention tools, including effective vaccination, enhanced biosecurity practice, and improved awareness of producers and traders, although widespread household poultry rearing significantly interferes with any such strategies. Nevertheless, continuous surveillance associated with rapid diagnosis and thorough virus characterization is the basis of such strategies.

Title: Influenza A viruses use multivalent sialic acid clusters for cell binding and receptor activation.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) binds its host cell using the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). HA recognizes sialic acid, a plasma membrane glycan that functions as the specific primary attachment factor (AF). Since sialic acid alone cannot fulfill a signaling function, the virus needs to activate downstream factors to trigger endocytic uptake. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family, was shown to be activated by IAV and transmit cell entry signals. However, how IAV's binding to sialic acid leads to engagement and activation of EGFR remains largely unclear. We used multicolor super-resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of both IAV's AFs and its functional receptor EGFR at the scale of the IAV particle. Intriguingly, quantitative cluster analysis revealed that AFs and EGFR are organized in partially overlapping submicrometer clusters in the plasma membrane of A549 cells. Within AF domains, the local AF concentration reaches on average 10-fold the background concentration and tends to increase towards the cluster center, thereby representing a multivalent virus-binding platform. Using our experimentally measured cluster characteristics, we simulated virus diffusion on a flat membrane. The results predict that the local AF concentration strongly influences the distinct mobility pattern of IAVs, in a manner consistent with live-cell single-virus tracking data. In contrast to AFs, EGFR resides in smaller clusters. Virus binding activates EGFR, but interestingly, this process occurs without a major lateral EGFR redistribution, indicating the activation of pre-formed clusters, which we show are long-lived. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative understanding of the initial steps of influenza virus infection. Co-clustering of AF and EGFR permit a cooperative effect of binding and signaling at specific platforms, thus linking their spatial organization to their functional role during virus-cell binding and receptor activation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the spatial organization of viral attachment factors and receptors on host cells and their role in virus binding and receptor activation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Structure of avian influenza hemagglutinin in complex with a small molecule entry inhibitor.
Abstract: HA plays a critical role in influenza infection and, thus HA is a potential target for antivirals. Recently, our laboratories have described a novel fusion inhibitor, termed CBS1117, with EC<sub>50</sub> ∼3 μM against group 1 HA. In this work, we characterize the binding properties of CBS1117 to avian H5 HA by x-ray crystallography, NMR, and mutagenesis. The x-ray structure of the complex shows that the compound binds near the HA fusion peptide, a region that plays a critical role in HA-mediated fusion. NMR studies demonstrate binding of CBS1117 to H5 HA in solution and show extensive hydrophobic contacts between the compound and HA surface. Mutagenesis studies further support the location of the compound binding site proximal to the HA fusion peptide and identify additional amino acids that are important to compound binding. Together, this work gives new insights into the CBS1117 mechanism of action and can be exploited to further optimize this compound and better understand the group specific activity of small-molecule inhibitors of HA-mediated entry.

Title: Virtual Screening Identifies Chebulagic Acid as an Inhibitor of the M2(S31N) Viral Ion Channel and Influenza A Virus.
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant influenza viruses emphasizes the need for new antiviral countermeasures. The M2 protein of influenza A is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel, which is essential for influenza replication and an established antiviral target. However, all currently circulating influenza A virus strains are now resistant to licensed M2-targeting adamantane drugs, primarily due to the widespread prevalence of an M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N). To identify new chemical leads that may target M2(S31N), we performed a virtual screen of molecules from two natural product libraries and identified chebulagic acid as a candidate M2(S31N) inhibitor and influenza antiviral. Chebulagic acid selectively restores growth of M2(S31N)-expressing yeast. Molecular modeling also suggests that chebulagic acid hydrolysis fragments preferentially interact with the highly-conserved histidine residue within the pore of M2(S31N) but not adamantane-sensitive M2(S31). In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibits in vitro influenza A replication regardless of M2 sequence, suggesting that it also acts on other influenza targets. Taken together, results implicate chebulagic acid and/or its hydrolysis fragments as new chemical leads for M2(S31N) and influenza-directed antiviral development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies a chemical inhibitor of the M2 ion channel and its antiviral activity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Within-Host Viral Diversity: A Window into Viral Evolution.
Abstract: The evolutionary dynamics of a virus can differ within hosts and across populations. Studies of within-host evolution provide an important link between experimental studies of virus evolution and large-scale phylodynamic analyses. They can determine the extent to which global processes are recapitulated on local scales and how accurately experimental infections model natural ones. They may also inform epidemiologic models of disease spread and reveal how host-level dynamics contribute to a virus's evolution at a larger scale. Over the last decade, advances in viral sequencing have enabled detailed studies of viral genetic diversity within hosts. I review how within-host diversity is sampled, measured, and expressed, and how comparative studies of viral diversity can be leveraged to elucidate a virus's evolutionary dynamics. These concepts are illustrated with detailed reviews of recent research on the within-host evolution of influenza virus, dengue virus, and cytomegalovirus.

Title: Regional Transmission and Reassortment of 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Viruses in Bulgarian Poultry 2017/18.
Abstract: Between 2017 and 2018, several farms across Bulgaria reported outbreaks of H5 highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. In this study we used genomic and traditional epidemiological analyses to trace the origin and subsequent spread of these outbreaks within Bulgaria. Both methods indicate two separate incursions, one restricted to the northeastern region of Dobrich, and another largely restricted to Central and Eastern Bulgaria including places such as Plovdiv, Sliven and Stara Zagora, as well as one virus from the Western region of Vidin. Both outbreaks likely originate from different European 2.3.4.4b virus ancestors circulating in 2017. The viruses were likely introduced by wild birds or poultry trade links in 2017 and have continued to circulate, but due to lack of contemporaneous sampling and sequences from wild bird viruses in Bulgaria, the precise route and timing of introduction cannot be determined. Analysis of whole genomes indicates a complete lack of reassortment in all segments but the matrix protein gene (MP), which presents as multiple smaller clusters associated with different European 2.3.4.4b viruses. Ancestral reconstruction of host states of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of viruses involved in the outbreaks suggests that transmission is driven by domestic ducks into galliform poultry. Thus, according to present evidence, we suggest the surveillance of domestic ducks as they are an epidemiologically relevant species for subclinical infection. Monitoring the spread due to movement between farms within regions and links to poultry production systems in European countries can help to predict and prevent future outbreaks. The 2.3.4.4b lineage which caused the largest recorded poultry epidemic in Europe continues to circulate, and the risk of further transmission by wild birds during migration remains.

Title: Genetic characterization of the first detected human case of low pathogenic avian influenza A/H9N2 in sub-Saharan Africa, Senegal.
Abstract: The H9N2 influenza virus has become one of the dominant subtypes of influenza virus circulating in poultry, wild birds, and can occasionally cross the mammalian species barrier. Here, we report the first human A/H9N2 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The patient was a child of 16 months' old living in the South-West of Senegal. He had no influenza vaccination history and no other disease history. He had symptoms of fever with an auxiliary temperature of 39.1°C. Respiratory symptoms were an intense cough, runny nose and pulmonary crackles. All eight genome segments belonged to the A/H9N2 AIV subtype and the strain characyerized as of low pathogenicity with a RSSR/GLF amino acids mo-tif. Phylogenetic analysis of both complete HA and NA gene segments showed that the A/H9N2 subtype virus from Senegal belonged to the G1 lineage. This human case highlights the weakness of influenza surveillance in animals and the need for enhanced surveillance using a one-health approach.

Title: Isolation of two novel reassortant H3N6 avian influenza viruses from long-distance migratory birds in Jiangxi Province, China.
Abstract: Two novel reassortant avian influenza A (H3N6) viruses were isolated from swan goose in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China, in 2014. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these viruses are most likely derived from the Eurasian-originated H3Ny (N3, N6, N8) and H5N6 viruses circulating among wild and domestic birds. It is noteworthy that H9N2 viruses have contributed PB1 gene to these novel H3N6 viruses. Our findings provide phylogenetic evidence to elucidate the ongoing viral reassortment in the wild bird population in southern China. Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Poyang Lake is warranted.

Title: Genetic and antigenic characterization of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory waterfowl in Mongolia from 2017 to 2019.
Abstract: The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of various subtypes (e.g., H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9) in poultry remains a global concern for animal and public health. Migratory waterfowls play important roles in the transmission of these viruses across countries. To monitor virus spread by wild birds, active surveillance for avian influenza in migratory waterfowl was conducted in Mongolia from 2015 to 2019. In total, 5000 fecal samples were collected from lakesides in central Mongolia, and 167 influenza A viruses were isolated. Two H5N3, four H7N3, and two H7N7 viruses were characterized in this study. The amino acid sequence at hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of those isolates suggested low pathogenicity in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all H5 and H7 viruses were closely related to recent H5 and H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) isolated from wild birds in Asia and Europe. Antigenicity of H7Nx was similar to those of typical non-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs). While HPAIVs or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)-related LPAIVs were not detected in migratory waterfowl in Mongolia, sporadic introductions of AIVs including H5 and H7 viruses into Mongolia through the wild bird migration were identified. Thus, continued monitoring of H5 and H7 AIVs in both domestic and wild birds is needed for the early detection of HPAIVs spread into the country.

Title: Phylogeography of Highly Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza Viruses in China.
Abstract: The spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses poses serious threats to the poultry industry, wild bird ecology and human health. Circulation of H5 viruses between poultry and wild birds is a significant public health threat in China. Thus, viral migration networks in this region need to be urgently studied. Here, we conducted molecular genetic analyses of the hemagglutinin genes of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in multiple hosts from 2000 to 2018 in China. Our aim was to clarify the roles of different hosts in the evolution of H5 viruses. We used a flexible Bayesian statistical framework to simulate viral space diffusion and continuous-time Markov chains to infer the dynamic evolutionary process of spatiotemporal dissemination. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of H5 viruses showed for the first time that H5 viruses in poultry and wild birds were present in Guangdong Province. Furthermore, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Hunan acted as the epicenters for the spread of various H5 subtypes viruses in poultry, and Henan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Inner Mongolia acted as epicenters for the spread of various H5 subtypes viruses in wild birds. Thus, H5 viruses exhibited distinct evolutionary dynamics in poultry and wild birds. Our findings extend our understanding of the transmission and spread of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses in China.

Title: Development of CRISPR as an Antiviral Strategy to Combat SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza.
Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the need for antiviral approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.

Title: Massively multiplexed nucleic acid detection with Cas13.
Abstract: The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples<sup>1-3</sup> while simultaneously testing for many pathogens<sup>4-6</sup>. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents<sup>7</sup> self-organize in a microwell array<sup>8</sup> to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health<sup>9-11</sup>.

Abstract: The transmission bottleneck is defined as the number of viral particles that transmit from one host to establish an infection in another. Genome sequence data have been used to evaluate the size of the transmission bottleneck between humans infected with the influenza virus; however, the methods used to make these estimates have some limitations. Specifically, viral allele frequencies, which form the basis of many calculations, may not fully capture a process which involves the transmission of entire viral genomes. Here, we set out a novel approach for inferring viral transmission bottlenecks; our method combines an algorithm for haplotype reconstruction with maximum likelihood methods for bottleneck inference. This approach allows for rapid calculation and performs well when applied to data from simulated transmission events; errors in the haplotype reconstruction step did not adversely affect inferences of the population bottleneck. Applied to data from a previous household transmission study of influenza A infection, we confirm the result that the majority of transmission events involve a small number of viruses, albeit with slightly looser bottlenecks being inferred, with between 1 and 13 particles transmitted in the majority of cases. While influenza A transmission involves a tight population bottleneck, the bottleneck is not so tight as to universally prevent the transmission of within-host viral diversity.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viral populations undergo a repeated cycle of within-host growth followed by transmission. Viral evolution is affected by each stage of this cycle. The number of viral particles transmitted from one host to another, known as the transmission bottleneck, is an important factor in determining how the evolutionary dynamics of the population play out, restricting the extent to which the evolved diversity of the population can be passed from one host to another. Previous study of viral sequence data has suggested that the transmission bottleneck size for influenza A transmission between human hosts is small. Reevaluating these data using a novel and improved method, we largely confirm this result, albeit that we infer a slightly higher bottleneck size in some cases, of between 1 and 13 virions. While a tight bottleneck operates in human influenza transmission, it is not extreme in nature; some diversity can be meaningfully retained between hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on transmission bottleneck size inferred from viral sequence data, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic Inference of H3N2 Canine Influenza A Outbreak in Ontario, Canada in 2018.
Abstract: The first Canadian H3N2 canine influenza A outbreak involving an Asian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) began in southwestern Ontario, Canada, in late December 2017. More H3N2 CIV cases were identified in central and eastern Ontario between March and October 2018. Based on epidemiological investigation, 5 clusters were identified (C1, C2, C3a, C3b, and C4); however, the origin of infection has only been revealed for epidemiological cluster C1. Here, we use phylogenetic analyses to unravel the links of virus transmission between the 5 epidemiological clusters and the origin of infection for all epidemiological clusters. Our results demonstrate that the Canadian H3N2 CIV sequences were grouped into four distinct phylogenetic clusters with minimal genetic diversity between these clusters. Large scale phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 CIV from around the globe showed that the Canadian CIVs formed a distinct new clade along with CIVs that have been circulating in the USA since 2017-2018 and in China since 2017. This clade shares a common ancestor of Asian origin. This study concludes that the H3N2 CIV outbreak in Ontario was driven by multiple introductions of South Korean/Chinese-origin H3N2 CIVs over 10 months.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper uses phylogenetic analyses to trace virus transmission and origins but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Put a cork in it: Plugging the M2 viral ion channel to sink influenza.
Abstract: The ongoing threat of seasonal and pandemic influenza to human health requires antivirals that can effectively supplement existing vaccination strategies. The M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel that is required for virus replication and is an established antiviral target. While licensed adamantane-based M2 antivirals have been historically used, M2 mutations that confer major adamantane resistance are now so prevalent in circulating virus strains that these drugs are no longer recommended. Here we review the current understanding of IAV M2 structure and function, mechanisms of inhibition, the rise of drug resistance mutations, and ongoing efforts to develop new antivirals that target resistant forms of M2.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of M2 ion channel structure, function, and drug resistance, without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: Subtype Diversity of Influenza A Virus in North American Waterfowl: a Multidecade Study.
Abstract: The discovery in 1976 of waterfowl as the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) has since spurred decades of waterfowl surveillance efforts by researchers dedicated to understanding the ecology of IAV and its subsequent threat to human and animal health. Here, we employed a multidecade, continental-scale approach of surveillance data to understand trends of seasonal IAV subtype diversity. Between 1976 and 2015, IAVs were detected in 8,427 (10.8%) of 77,969 samples from migratory waterfowl throughout the Central and Mississippi Migratory Flyways in the United States and Canada. A total of 96 hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations were isolated, which included most HA (H1 to H14) and all 9 NA subtypes. We observed an annual trend of high influenza prevalence, involving a few dominant subtypes, on northern breeding grounds during summer with progressively lowered influenza prevalence, comprised of a highly diverse profile of subtypes, as waterfowl migrate toward southern wintering grounds. Isolates recovered during winter had the highest proportion of mixed and rare HA/NA combinations, indicating increased opportunity for reassortment of IAVs. In addition, 70% of H5 and 49% of H7 IAV isolates were recovered from samples collected during fall and spring, respectively; these are subtypes that can have significant implications for public health and agriculture sectors. Annual cyclical dominance of subtypes on northern breeding grounds is revealed through the longitudinal nature of this study. Our novel findings exhibit the unrealized potential for discovery using existing IAV surveillance data.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and are therefore responsible for the dispersal and maintenance of IAVs representing a broad range of antigenic and genetic diversity. The aims of IAV surveillance in waterfowl not only relate to understanding the risk of spillover risk to humans, but also to improving our understanding of basic questions related to IAV evolution and ecology. By evaluating several decades of surveillance data from wild aquatic birds sampled along North American migratory flyways, we discovered an annual trend of increasing subtype diversity during southbound migration, peaking on southern wintering grounds. Winter sampling revealed the highest proportion of mixed and rare infections that suggest higher opportunity for spillover. These findings allow improvements to surveillance efforts to robustly capture IAV diversity that will be used for vaccine development and cultivate a more thorough understanding of IAV evolution and persistence mechanisms.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a surveillance study describing subtype diversity and prevalence without explicit genotype-phenotype functional links.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in 2018.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a total of 3993 human influenza-positive samples during 2018. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. Selected viruses were propagated in qualified cells or hens' eggs for use as potential seasonal influenza vaccine virus candidates. In 2018, influenza A(H1)pdm09 viruses predominated over influenza A(H3) and B viruses, accounting for a total of 53% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO-recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2018. However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that a significant proportion of circulating A(H3) viruses had undergone genetic drift relative to the WHO-recommended vaccine strain for 2018. Of 2864 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, three A(H1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, while one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition by both oseltamivir and zanamivir.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a report on surveillance and genetic/antigenic characterization of influenza viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype functional studies.

Title: Novel HPAIV H5N8 Reassortant (Clade 2.3.4.4b) Detected in Germany.
Abstract: A novel H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected in a greater white-fronted goose in January 2020 in Brandenburg, Germany, and, in February 2020, in domestic chickens belonging to a smallholding in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Full-genome sequencing was conducted on the MinION platform, enabling further phylogenetic analyses. The virus of clade 2.3.4.4b holds six segments from a Eurasian/Asian/African HPAIV H5N8 reassortant and two segments from low pathogenic avian influenza H3N8 subtype viruses recently detected in wild birds in Central Russia. These new entries continue to show the reassortment potential of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses, underlining the necessity for full-genome sequencing and continuous surveillance.

Title: Evaluation of two multiplex RT-PCR assays for detection and subtype differentiation of Brazilian swine influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are endemic in swine herds in most pork producing countries; however, the viruses circulating in different geographic regions are antigenically and genetically distinct. In this sense, the availability of a rapid diagnostic assay to detect locally adapted IAVs and discriminate the virus subtype in clinical samples from swine is extremely important for monitoring and control of the disease. This study describes the development and validation of a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and subtyping of IAV from pigs. The analytical and diagnostic specificity of the assays was 100% (94.3-100.0, CI 95%), and the limit of detection was 10<sup>-3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. A total of 100 samples (IAV isolates and clinical specimens) were tested, and the virus subtype was determined for 80 samples (80%; 71.1-86.7, CI 95%). From these, 50% were H1N1, 22.5% were H1N2, and 7.5% were H3N2. Partial subtyping was determined for 8.75% samples (H1pdmNx and HxN2). Additionally, mixed infections with two virus subtypes (H1N2 + H3N2 and H1N1pdm + H1pdmN2; 2.5%) and reassortant viruses (H1pdmN2, 6.25%; and H1N1hu, 2.5%) were detected by the assay. A rapid detection of the most prevalent IAV subtypes and lineages in swine is provided by the assays developed here, improving the IAV diagnosis in Brazilian laboratories, and contributing to the IAV monitoring.

Title: Emergence of human avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in Wenshan City in Southwest China, 2017.
Abstract: The emergence of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was reported in Wenshan City, southwestern China in 2017. The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection. Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100 km to the east of Wenshan City. In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan. Hygienic management of live poultry markets and virological screening of chickens transported across regions should be reinforced to limit the spread of H7N9 virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports epidemiological and phylogenetic features of H7N9 outbreak but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: ACKR2 contributes to pulmonary dysfunction by shaping CCL5:CCR5-dependent recruitment of lymphocytes during influenza A infection in mice.
Abstract: Inflammation triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection is important for viral clearance, induction of adaptive responses, and return to lung homeostasis. However, an exaggerated immune response, characterized by the overproduction of chemokines, can lead to intense lung injury, contributing to mortality. Chemokine scavenger receptors, such as ACKR2, control the levels of CC chemokines influencing the immune responses. Among the chemokine targets of ACKR2, CCL5 is important to recruit and activate lymphocytes. We investigated the role of ACKR2 during IAV infection in mice. Pulmonary ACKR2 expression was increased acutely after IAV infection preceding the virus-induced lung dysfunction. ACKR2-knockout (ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were protected from IAV, presenting decreased viral burden and lung dysfunction. Mechanistically, the absence of ACKR2 resulted in augmented airway CCL5 levels, secreted by mononuclear and plasma cells in the lung parenchyma. The higher chemokine gradient led to an augmented recruitment of T and B lymphocytes, formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and production of IgA in the airways of ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice post-IAV. CCL5 neutralization in ACKR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice prevented lymphocyte recruitment and increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein levels and pulmonary dysfunction. Finally, CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> mice presented increased disease severity during IAV infection, displaying increased neutrophils, pulmonary injury and dysfunction, and accentuated lethality. Collectively, our data showed that ACKR2 dampens CCL5 levels and the consequent recruitment of CCR5<sup>+</sup> T helper 1 (Th1), T regulatory cells (Tregs), and B lymphocytes during IAV infection, decreasing pathogen control and promoting lung dysfunction in wild type mice. Therefore, ACKR2 is detrimental and CCR5 is protective during IAV infection coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses in mice.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of ACKR2 and CCR5 in immune response and lung dysfunction during influenza A infection in mice, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Swine Influenza A Viruses and the Tangled Relationship with Humans.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are the causative agents of one of the most important viral respiratory diseases in pigs and humans. Human and swine IAV are prone to interspecies transmission, leading to regular incursions from human to pig and vice versa. This bidirectional transmission of IAV has heavily influenced the evolutionary history of IAV in both species. Transmission of distinct human seasonal lineages to pigs, followed by sustained within-host transmission and rapid adaptation and evolution, represent a considerable challenge for pig health and production. Consequently, although only subtypes of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are endemic in swine around the world, extensive diversity can be found in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, as well as the remaining six genes. We review the complicated global epidemiology of IAV in swine and the inextricably entangled implications for public health and influenza pandemic planning.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of the epidemiology and evolution of swine influenza A viruses and their relationship with humans, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: HopPER: an adaptive model for probability estimation of influenza reassortment through host prediction.
Abstract: Influenza reassortment, a mechanism where influenza viruses exchange their RNA segments by co-infecting a single cell, has been implicated in several major pandemics since 19th century. Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper presents a computational model for predicting influenza reassortment based on host tropism, without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Pathobiological Origins and Evolutionary History of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: High-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have arisen from low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses via changes in the hemagglutinin proteolytic cleavage site, which include mutation of multiple nonbasic to basic amino acids, duplication of basic amino acids, or recombination with insertion of cellular or viral amino acids. Between 1959 and 2019, a total of 42 natural, independent H5 (<i>n</i> = 15) and H7 (<i>n</i> = 27) LPAI to HPAI virus conversion events have occurred in Europe (<i>n</i> = 16), North America (<i>n</i> = 9), Oceania (<i>n</i> = 7), Asia (<i>n</i> = 5), Africa (<i>n</i> = 4), and South America (<i>n</i> = 1). Thirty-eight of these HPAI outbreaks were limited in the number of poultry premises affected and were eradicated. However, poultry outbreaks caused by A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5Nx), Mexican H7N3, and Chinese H7N9 HPAI lineages have continued. Active surveillance and molecular detection and characterization efforts will provide the best opportunity for early detection and eradication from domestic birds.

Title: Agricultural and geographic factors shaped the North American 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 outbreak.
Abstract: The 2014-2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study analyzes epidemiological and geographic factors shaping an HPAI outbreak using evolutionary models, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Development of a Multiplex RT-qPCR for the Detection of Different Clades of Avian Influenza in Poultry.
Abstract: Since the initial detection of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, in 1996 in China, numerous HPAI H5 lineages have been classified, and they continue to pose a threat to animal and human health. In this study, we developed a novel primer/probe set that can be employed to simultaneously detect pan-H5 HPAI and two clades, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4, of H5Nx viruses using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The sensitivity and specificity of these primer sets and probes were confirmed with a number of different subtypes of influenza virus and the H5-HA gene plasmid DNA. In particular, the multiplex RT-qPCR assay was successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of H5 HPAI and different virus clades in clinical field samples from a poultry farm. Therefore, this multiplex assay and a novel detection primer set and probes will be useful for the laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological field studies of different circulating H5 HPAI virus clades in poultry and migratory wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study develops a multiplex RT-qPCR assay for detecting different clades of avian influenza viruses, focusing on diagnostic tool development rather than genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Influenza A and B in a cohort of outpatient children and adolescent with influenza like-illness during two consecutive influenza seasons.
Abstract: Influenza is an important cause of morbimortality worldwide. Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.

Title: Quantitative efficacy paradigms of the influenza clinical drug candidate EIDD-2801 in the ferret model.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza viruses cause major morbidity and mortality worldwide, threatening in particular older adults and the immunocompromised. Two classes of influenza therapeutics dominate current disease management, but both are compromised by pre-existing or rapidly emerging viral resistance. We have recently reported a novel ribonucleoside analog clinical candidate, EIDD-2801, that combines potent antiviral efficacy in ferrets and human airway epithelium cultures with a high barrier against viral escape. In this study, we established fundamental EIDD-2801 efficacy paradigms against pandemic and seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) strains in ferrets that can be used to inform exposure targets and treatment regimens. Based on reduction of shed virus titers, alleviation of clinical signs, and lowered virus burden in upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, lowest efficacious oral dose concentrations of EIDD-2801, given twice daily, were 2.3 and 7 mg/kg of body weight against seasonal and pandemic IAVs, respectively. The latest opportunity for initiation of efficacious treatment was 36 hours after infection of ferrets. Administered in 12-hour intervals, three 7 mg/kg doses of EIDD-2801 were sufficient for maximal therapeutic benefit against a pandemic IAV and significantly shortened the time to resolution of clinical signs. Ferrets infected with pandemic IAV and treated following the minimally efficacious EIDD-2801 regimen demonstrated significantly less shed virus and inflammatory cellular infiltrates in nasal lavages, but mounted a robust humoral antiviral response after recovery that was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated animals. These results provide an experimental basis in a human disease-relevant influenza animal model for clinical testing of EIDD-2801.

Reason: The paper evaluates the efficacy of an influenza drug candidate in ferrets, focusing on treatment outcomes rather than genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Caspase-Mediated Cleavage of Human Cortactin during Influenza A Virus Infection Occurs in Its Actin-Binding Domains and Is Associated with Released Virus Titres.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) exploits host factors to multiply and cause disease. An in-depth knowledge of this interaction of IAV with the host will aid the development of anti-IAV intervention strategies. Previously, we demonstrated that host cortactin, an actin filament-binding protein promotes IAV infection, but undergoes degradation via a lysosome-associated apoptotic pathway during the late stages of IAV infection. Next, we wanted to further understand the mechanisms and significance of this phenomenon. By using the RNA interference screens and site-directed mutagenesis followed by western blotting, we found that lysosome protease, cathepsin C is involved in cortactin degradation in human cells infected with IAV. Furthermore, executioner apoptotic caspase, caspase-3 not caspase-6 or caspase-7 is involved in cortactin degradation during IAV infection, and caspase-3 cleavage site is located in the first actin-binding repeat of cortactin polypeptide. Finally, when expressed ectopically, the cleavage-resistant cortactin mutants decreased the amount of IAV progeny released from infected cells that was enhanced by the cleavage-sensitive cortactin wild type. These data strengthen the hypothesis proposed earlier that host cortactin plays an inhibitory role during the late stages of IAV infection, and IAV is facilitating its degradation to undermine such function.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host protein cortactin cleavage during influenza A infection and its effect on virus release, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Assessing the susceptibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses to oseltamivir using embryonated chicken eggs.
Abstract: The susceptibility of influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) is studied using enzyme-based assays, sequence analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) is the active prodrug of the NAI oseltamivir. There is lack of information on the use of embryonated chicken eggs for studying susceptibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses to antiviral drugs. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs for studying antiviral susceptibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Two HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from India were used in the study. Fluorescence-based NAI assay was performed to determine antiviral susceptibility of these viruses. In ovo antiviral assays were carried out using 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs. The virus dilutions were incubated with 14 μg/ml of OC and inoculated in the allantoic cavity. In the eggs, 50 per cent egg infectious dose (EID<sub>50</sub>) titres as well as mortality were quantitated. The two viruses used were susceptible to OC in the NAI assay. It was found that there was a significant drop in EID<sub>50</sub>titres; however, no significant protection from mortality after OC treatment was observed. By measuring viral titres, the egg model was suitable to study the susceptibility of HPAI viruses to antiviral drugs along with NAI assay. The present study highlights the use of eggs as a model to study susceptibility of HPAI viruses to OC.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study assesses antiviral susceptibility of H5N1 viruses using embryonated eggs but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Structural and Functional Aspects of G-Quadruplex Aptamers Which Bind a Broad Range of Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: An aptamer is a synthetic oligonucleotide with a unique spatial structure that provides specific binding to a target. To date, several aptamers to hemagglutinin of the influenza A virus have been described, which vary in affinity and strain specificity. Among them, the DNA aptamer RHA0385 is able to recognize influenza hemagglutinins with highly variable sequences. In this paper, the structure of RHA0385 was studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and size-exclusion chromatography, demonstrating the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex structure. Three derivatives of RHA0385 were designed in order to determine the contribution of the major loop to affinity. Shortening of the major loop from seven to three nucleotides led to stabilization of the scaffold. The affinities of the derivatives were studied by surface plasmon resonance and an enzyme-linked aptamer assay on recombinant hemagglutinins and viral particles, respectively. The alterations in the loop affected the binding to influenza hemagglutinin, but did not abolish it. Contrary to aptamer RHA0385, two of the designed aptamers were shown to be conformationally homogeneous, retaining high affinities and broad binding abilities for both recombinant hemagglutinins and whole influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies aptamer binding to influenza A hemagglutinin and structural-functional aspects of aptamers, not viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Alignment-free genomic sequence comparison using FCGR and signal processing.
Abstract: Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing "nearby" species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees. We describe one such method that gives quite strong results. We use the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) to create images from such sequences, We then reduce dimension, first using a Fourier trig transform, followed by a Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). This gives vectors of modest length. These in turn are used for fast sequence lookup, construction of phylogenetic trees, and classification of virus genomic data. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach on several benchmark test sets. The tandem of FCGR and dimension reductions using Fourier-type transforms and SVD provides a powerful approach for alignment-free genomic comparison. Results compare favorably and often surpass best results reported in prior literature. Good scalability is also observed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes an alignment-free genomic sequence comparison method without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: H9 Influenza Viruses: An Emerging Challenge.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the H9 subtype are enzootic in Asia, the Middle East, and parts of North and Central Africa, where they cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Of note, some strains of H9N2 viruses have been linked to zoonotic episodes of mild respiratory diseases. Because of the threat posed by H9N2 viruses to poultry and human health, these viruses are considered of pandemic concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). H9N2 IAVs continue to diversify into multiple antigenically and phylogenetically distinct lineages that can further promote the emergence of strains with pandemic potential. Somewhat neglected compared with the H5 and H7 subtypes, there are numerous indicators that H9N2 viruses could be involved directly or indirectly in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic. The goal of this work is to discuss the state of knowledge on H9N2 IAVs and to provide an update on the contemporary global situation.

Abstract: Out of the 14 avian β-defensins identified in the <i>Gallus gallus</i> genome, only 3 are present in the chicken egg, including the egg-specific avian β-defensin 11 (<i>Gga</i>-AvBD11). Given its specific localization and its established antibacterial activity, <i>Gga</i>-AvBD11 appears to play a protective role in embryonic development. <i>Gga</i>-AvBD11 is an atypical double-sized defensin, predicted to possess 2 motifs related to β-defensins and 6 disulfide bridges. The 3-dimensional NMR structure of the purified <i>Gga-</i>AvBD11 is a compact fold composed of 2 packed β-defensin domains. This fold is the archetype of a structural family, dubbed herein as avian-double-β-defensins (Av-DBD). We speculate that <i>AvBD11</i> emanated from a monodomain gene ancestor and that similar events might have occurred in arthropods, leading to another structural family of less compact DBDs. We show that <i>Gga</i>-AvBD11 displays antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens, the avian protozoan <i>Eimeria tenella</i>, and avian influenza virus. <i>Gga</i>-AvBD11 also shows cytotoxic and antiinvasive activities, suggesting that it may not only be involved in innate protection of the chicken embryo, but also in the (re)modeling of embryonic tissues. Finally, the contribution of either of the 2 <i>Gga</i>-AvBD11 domains to these biological activities was assessed, using chemically synthesized peptides. Our results point to a critical importance of the cationic N-terminal domain in mediating antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antiinvasive activities, with the C-terminal domain potentiating the 2 latter activities. Strikingly, antiviral activity in infected chicken cells, accompanied by marked cytotoxicity, requires the full-length protein.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies the structure and function of an avian defensin protein with antiviral activity but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bat IFITM3 restriction depends on S-palmitoylation and a polymorphic site within the CD225 domain.
Abstract: Host interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad-spectrum antiviral restriction factors. Of these, IFITM3 potently inhibits viruses that enter cells through acidic endosomes, many of which are zoonotic and emerging viruses with bats (order Chiroptera) as their natural hosts. We previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here, we show that bat IFITMs are characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important site-codon 70-within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat IFITM3 impairs restriction of representatives of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105, mutation of each cysteine individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant loses all restriction activity, concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites. Thus, we propose that S-palmitoylation is critical for Chiropteran IFITM3 function and identify a key molecular determinant of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host IFITM3 protein polymorphisms and their effect on viral restriction, not on viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Next-Generation Sequencing: An Eye-Opener for the Surveillance of Antiviral Resistance in Influenza.
Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can enable a more effective response to a wide range of communicable disease threats, such as influenza, which is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. After vaccination, antivirals are the second line of defense against influenza. The use of currently available antivirals can lead to antiviral resistance mutations in the entire influenza genome. Therefore, the methods to detect these mutations should be developed and implemented. In this Opinion, we assess how NGS could be implemented to detect drug resistance mutations in clinical influenza virus isolates.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an opinion piece discussing the use of next-generation sequencing for detecting antiviral resistance mutations, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage data.

Title: Statistical characteristics of amino acid covariance as possible descriptors of viral genomic complexity.
Abstract: At the sequence level it is hard to describe the complexity of viruses which allows them to challenge host immune system, some for a few weeks and others up to a complete compromise. Paradoxically, viral genomes are both complex and simple. Complex because amino acid mutation rates are very high, and yet viruses remain functional. Simple because they have barely around 10 types of proteins, so viral protein-protein interaction networks are not insightful. In this work we use fine-grained amino acid level information and their evolutionary characteristics obtained from large-scale genomic data to develop a statistical panel, towards the goal of developing quantitative descriptors for the biological complexity of viruses. Networks were constructed from pairwise covariation of amino acids and were statistically analyzed. Three differentiating factors arise: predominantly intra- vs inter-protein covariance relations, the nature of the node degree distribution and network density. Interestingly, the covariance relations were primarily intra-protein in avian influenza and inter-protein in HIV. The degree distributions showed two universality classes: a power-law with exponent -1 in HIV and avian-influenza, random behavior in human flu and dengue. The calculated covariance network density correlates well with the mortality strengths of viruses on the viral-Richter scale. These observations suggest the potential utility of the statistical metrics for describing the covariance patterns in viruses. Our host-virus interaction analysis point to the possibility that host proteins which can interact with multiple viral proteins may be responsible for shaping the inter-protein covariance relations. With the available data, it appears that network density might be a surrogate for the virus Richter scale, however the hypothesis needs a re-examination when large scale complete genome data for more viruses becomes available.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops statistical descriptors of viral genomic complexity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Incorporating heterogeneous sampling probabilities in continuous phylogeographic inference - Application to H5N1 spread in the Mekong region.
Abstract: The potentially low precision associated with the geographic origin of sampled sequences represents an important limitation for spatially explicit (i.e. continuous) phylogeographic inference of fast-evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses. A substantial proportion of publicly available sequences is geo-referenced at broad spatial scale such as the administrative unit of origin, rather than more precise locations (e.g. geographic coordinates). Most frequently, such sequences are either discarded prior to continuous phylogeographic inference or arbitrarily assigned to the geographic coordinates of the centroid of their administrative area of origin for lack of a better alternative. We here implement and describe a new approach that allows to incorporate heterogeneous prior sampling probabilities over a geographic area. External data, such as outbreak locations, are used to specify these prior sampling probabilities over a collection of sub-polygons. We apply this new method to the analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade data in the Mekong region. Our method allows to properly include, in continuous phylogeographic analyses, H5N1 sequences that are only associated with large administrative areas of origin and assign them with more accurate locations. Finally, we use continuous phylogeographic reconstructions to analyse the dispersal dynamics of different H5N1 clades and investigate the impact of environmental factors on lineage dispersal velocities. Our new method allowing heterogeneous sampling priors for continuous phylogeographic inference is implemented in the open-source multi-platform software package BEAST 1.10. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogeographic methods and spatial inference of viral spread, not on genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Spatiotemporal reconstruction and transmission dynamics during the 2016-17 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic in Italy.
Abstract: Effective control of avian diseases in domestic populations requires understanding of the transmission dynamics facilitating viral emergence and spread. In 2016-17, Italy experienced a significant avian influenza epidemic caused by a highly pathogenic A(H5N8) virus, which affected domestic premises housing around 2.7 million birds, primarily in the north-eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the success of control measures. Using an approach based on phylogenetic-temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the presence of cryptic wild bird-mediated transmission, information that can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from incursions across the wildlife-domestic interface, a common challenge in veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with occasional long-distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of human-mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked domestic cases are unusually high.

Reason: The study reconstructs transmission dynamics and spatial spread of H5N8 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Breaking the Convention: Sialoglycan Variants, Coreceptors, and Alternative Receptors for Influenza A Virus Entry.
Abstract: The influenza A virus (IAV) envelope protein hemagglutinin binds α2,6- or α2,3-linked sialic acid as a host cell receptor. Bat IAV subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 form an exception to this rule and do not bind sialic acid but enter cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Here, we review current knowledge on IAV receptors with a focus on sialoglycan variants, protein coreceptors, and alternative receptors that impact IAV attachment and internalization beyond the well-described sialic acid binding.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of influenza A virus receptors and entry mechanisms, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: First report of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus in Oman: The need for a One Health approach.
Abstract: Following the detection of the first human case of avian influenza A subtype H9N2 in 1998, more than 40 cases were diagnosed worldwide. However, the spread of the virus has been more remarkable and significant in global poultry populations, causing notable economic losses despite its low pathogenicity. Many surveillance studies and activities conducted in several countries have shown the predominance of this virus subtype. We present the case of a 14-month-old female in Oman with an A(H9N2) virus infection. This is the first human case of A(H9N2) reported from Oman and the Gulf Cooperation Countries, and Oman is the second country outside of southern and eastern Asia to report a case (cases have also been detected in Egypt). The patient had bronchial asthma and presented with a high-grade temperature and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection that necessitated admission to a high dependency unit in a tertiary care hospital. It is of urgency that a multisector One Health approach be established to combat the threat of avian influenza at the animal-human interface. In addition to enhancements of surveillance and control in poultry, there is a need to develop screening and preventive programs for high-risk occupations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports a human case of H9N2 infection and calls for surveillance but does not analyze viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Disentangling the role of Africa in the global spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Abstract: The role of Africa in the dynamics of the global spread of a zoonotic and economically-important virus, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx of the Gs/GD lineage, remains unexplored. Here we characterise the spatiotemporal patterns of virus diffusion during three HPAI H5Nx intercontinental epidemic waves and demonstrate that Africa mainly acted as an ecological sink of the HPAI H5Nx viruses. A joint analysis of host dynamics and continuous spatial diffusion indicates that poultry trade as well as wild bird migrations have contributed to the virus spreading into Africa, with West Africa acting as a crucial hotspot for virus introduction and dissemination into the continent. We demonstrate varying paths of avian influenza incursions into Africa as well as virus spread within Africa over time, which reveal that virus expansion is a complex phenomenon, shaped by an intricate interplay between avian host ecology, virus characteristics and environmental variables.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes spatial and host dynamics of H5Nx virus spread in Africa, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Molecular Characterization of a Novel Avian Influenza A (H2N9) Strain Isolated from Wild Duck in Korea in 2018.
Abstract: A novel avian influenza virus (A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018) (H2N9) was isolated from wild birds in South Korea in 2018, and phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted on complete gene sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) virus belonged to the Eurasian countries, whereas other internal genes (polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), PB2, nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein (M), and non-structural protein (NS)) belonged to the East Asian countries. A monobasic amino acid (PQIEPR/GLF) at the HA cleavage site, E627 in the PB2 gene, and no deletion of the stalk region in the NA gene indicated that the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) isolate was a typical low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). Nucleotide sequence similarity analysis of HA revealed that the highest homology (98.34%) is to that of A/duck/Mongolia/482/2015 (H2N3), and amino acid sequence of NA was closely related to that of A/duck/Bangladesh/8987/2010 (H10N9) (96.45%). In contrast, internal genes showed homology higher than 98% compared to those of other isolates derived from duck and wild birds of China or Japan in 2016-2018. The newly isolated A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) strain is the first reported avian influenza virus in Korea, and may have evolved from multiple genotypes in wild birds and ducks in Mongolia, China, and Japan.

Title: Characterization of orally efficacious influenza drug with high resistance barrier in ferrets and human airway epithelia.
Abstract: Influenza viruses constitute a major health threat and economic burden globally, frequently exacerbated by preexisting or rapidly emerging resistance to antiviral therapeutics. To address the unmet need of improved influenza therapy, we have created EIDD-2801, an isopropylester prodrug of the ribonucleoside analog <i>N</i> <sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) that has shown broad anti-influenza virus activity in cultured cells and mice. Pharmacokinetic profiling demonstrated that EIDD-2801 was orally bioavailable in ferrets and nonhuman primates. Therapeutic oral dosing of influenza virus-infected ferrets reduced group pandemic 1 and group 2 seasonal influenza A shed virus load by multiple orders of magnitude and alleviated fever, airway epithelium histopathology, and inflammation, whereas postexposure prophylactic dosing was sterilizing. Deep sequencing highlighted lethal viral mutagenesis as the underlying mechanism of activity and revealed a prohibitive barrier to the development of viral resistance. Inhibitory concentrations were low nanomolar against influenza A and B viruses in disease-relevant well-differentiated human air-liquid interface airway epithelia. Correlating antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity thresholds with pharmacokinetic profiles in human airway epithelium models revealed a therapeutic window >1713 and established dosing parameters required for efficacious human therapy. These data recommend EIDD-2801 as a clinical candidate with high potential for monotherapy of seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections. Our results inform EIDD-2801 clinical trial design and drug exposure targets.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, May 19-September 28, 2019, and Composition of the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: During May 19-September 28, 2019,* low levels of influenza activity were reported in the United States, with cocirculation of influenza A and influenza B viruses. In the Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza viruses circulated widely, with influenza A(H3) predominating in many regions; however, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were predominant in some countries. In late September, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended components for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and included an update to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. Annual influenza vaccination is the best means for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and vaccination before influenza activity increases is optimal. Health care providers should recommend vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications to vaccination (1).

Title: Seasonal dynamics of influenza viruses and age distribution of infected individuals across nine seasons covering 2009-2018 in Taiwan.
Abstract: A swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (termed A/H1N1pdm) caused a pandemic in 2009 and has continuously circulated in the human population. To investigate its possible ecological effects on circulating influenza strains, the seasonal patterns of influenza viruses and the respective age distribution of infected patients were studies. The data obtained from national influenza surveillance systems in Taiwan from July 2009 to June 2018 were analyzed. The A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 strains usually caused a higher ratio of severe to mild cases than influenza B. New variants of A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 emerged accompanied by a large epidemic peak. However, the new influenza B variants intended to circulate for several seasons before causing a large epidemic. The major group of outpatients affected by A/H1N1pdm were aged 13-23 years in the pandemic wave, and the age range of infected individuals gradually shifted to 24-49 and 0-6 years across seasons; A/H1N1pdm-infected inpatients were aged 24-49 years in 2009-2011, and the age range gradually switched to older groups aged 50-65 and >65 years. Individuals aged 0-6 or 24-49 years accounted for the majority of A/H3N2-infected outpatients across seasons, whereas most of the inpatients affected by A/H3N2 were aged >65 years. Understanding the effects of new variants and changes in dominant circulating viral strains on the age distribution of the affected human population, disease severity and epidemic levels is useful for the establishment of fine-tuned strategies for further improvement of influenza control.

Title: Intense interseasonal influenza outbreaks, Australia, 2018/19.
Abstract: BackgroundInterseasonal influenza outbreaks are not unusual in countries with temperate climates and well-defined influenza seasons. Usually, these are small and diminish before the main influenza season begins. However, the 2018/19 summer-autumn interseasonal influenza period in Australia saw unprecedented large and widespread influenza outbreaks.AimOur objective was to determine the extent of the intense 2018/19 interseasonal influenza outbreaks in Australia epidemiologically and examine the genetic, antigenic and structural properties of the viruses responsible for these outbreaks.MethodsThis observational study combined the epidemiological and virological surveillance data obtained from the Australian Government Department of Health, the New South Wales Ministry of Health, sentinel outpatient surveillance, public health laboratories and data generated by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne and the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research.ResultsThere was a record number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases during the interseasonal period November 2018 to May 2019 (n= 85,286; 5 times the previous 3-year average) and also more institutional outbreaks, hospitalisations and deaths, than what is normally seen.ConclusionsThe unusually large interseasonal influenza outbreaks in 2018/19 followed a mild 2018 influenza season and resulted in a very early start to the 2019 influenza season across Australia. The reasons for this unusual event have yet to be fully elucidated but are likely to be a complex mix of climatic, virological and host immunity-related factors. These outbreaks reinforce the need for year-round surveillance of influenza, even in temperate climates with strong seasonality patterns.

Title: Global patterns of avian influenza A (H7): virus evolution and zoonotic threats.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) continue to impose a negative impact on animal and human health worldwide. In particular, the emergence of highly pathogenic AIV H5 and, more recently, the emergence of low pathogenic AIV H7N9 have led to enormous socioeconomical losses in the poultry industry and resulted in fatal human infections. While H5N1 remains infamous, the number of zoonotic infections with H7N9 has far surpassed those attributed to H5. Despite the clear public health concerns posed by AIV H7, it is unclear why specifically this virus subtype became endemic in poultry and emerged in humans. In this review, we bring together data on global patterns of H7 circulation, evolution and emergence in humans. Specifically, we discuss data from the wild bird reservoir, expansion and epidemiology in poultry, significant increase in their zoonotic potential since 2013 and genesis of highly pathogenic H7. In addition, we analysed available sequence data from an evolutionary perspective, demonstrating patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions and reassortment dynamics. The integration of all aspects is crucial in the optimisation of surveillance efforts in wild birds, poultry and humans, and we emphasise the need for a One Health approach in controlling emerging viruses such as AIV H7.

Reason: This is a review summarizing global patterns of H7 virus evolution and zoonotic threats without explicit experimental links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Recalling the Future: Immunological Memory Toward Unpredictable Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Persistent and durable immunological memory forms the basis of any successful vaccination protocol. Generation of pre-existing memory B cell and T cell pools is thus the key for maintaining protective immunity to seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza viruses. Long-lived antibody secreting cells (ASCs) are responsible for maintaining antibody levels in peripheral blood. Generated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T help after naïve B cell precursors encounter their cognate antigen, the linked processes of differentiation (including Ig class switching) and proliferation also give rise to memory B cells, which then can change rapidly to ASC status after subsequent influenza encounters. Given that influenza viruses evolve rapidly as a consequence of antibody-driven mutational change (antigenic drift), the current influenza vaccines need to be reformulated frequently and annual vaccination is recommended. Without that process of regular renewal, they provide little protection against "drifted" (particularly H3N2) variants and are mainly ineffective when a novel pandemic (2009 A/H1N1 "swine" flu) strain suddenly emerges. Such limitation of antibody-mediated protection might be circumvented, at least in part, by adding a novel vaccine component that promotes cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for conserved viral peptides, presented by widely distributed HLA types. Such "memory" cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can rapidly be recalled to CTL effector status. Here, we review how B cells and follicular T cells are elicited following influenza vaccination and how they survive into a long-term memory. We describe how CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL memory is established following influenza virus infection, and how a robust CTL recall response can lead to more rapid virus elimination by destroying virus-infected cells, and recovery. Exploiting long-term, cross-reactive CTL against the continuously evolving and unpredictable influenza viruses provides a possible mechanism for preventing a disastrous pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 H1N1 "Spanish flu," which killed more than 50 million people worldwide.

Title: Microbial Composition of the Human Nasopharynx Varies According to Influenza Virus Type and Vaccination Status.
Abstract: Factors that contribute to enhanced susceptibility to severe bacterial disease after influenza virus infection are not well defined but likely include the microbiome of the respiratory tract. Vaccination against influenza, while having variable effectiveness, could also play a role in microbial community stability. We collected nasopharyngeal samples from 215 individuals infected with influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B virus and profiled the microbiota by target sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified signature taxonomic groups by performing linear discriminant analysis and effective size comparisons (LEfSe) and defined bacterial community types using Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. Influenza infection was shown to be significantly associated with microbial composition of the nasopharynx according to the virus type and the vaccination status of the patient. We identified four microbial community types across the combined cohort of influenza patients and healthy individuals with one community type most representative of the influenza virus-infected group. We also identified microbial taxa for which relative abundance was significantly higher in the unvaccinated elderly group; these taxa include species known to be associated with pneumonia.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Our results suggest that there is a significant association between the composition of the microbiota in the nasopharynx and the influenza virus type causing the infection. We observe that vaccination status, especially in more senior individuals, also has an association with the microbial community profile. This indicates that vaccination against influenza, even when ineffective to prevent disease, could play a role in controlling secondary bacterial complications.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes microbiome composition in relation to influenza virus type and vaccination status but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to viral phenotypes.

Title: Circulation and characterization of seasonal influenza viruses in Cambodia, 2012-2015.
Abstract: Influenza virus circulation is monitored through the Cambodian influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance system and isolates are characterized by the National Influenza Centre (NIC). Seasonal influenza circulation has previously been characterized by year-round activity and a peak during the rainy season (June-November). We documented the circulation of seasonal influenza in Cambodia for 2012-2015 and investigated genetic, antigenic, and antiviral resistance characteristics of influenza isolates. Respiratory samples were collected from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) at 11 hospitals throughout Cambodia. First-line screening was conducted by the National Institute of Public Health and the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences. Confirmation of testing and genetic, antigenic and antiviral resistance characterization was conducted by Institute Pasteur in Cambodia, the NIC. Additional virus characterization was conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (Melbourne, Australia). Between 2012 and 2015, 1,238 influenza-positive samples were submitted to the NIC. Influenza A(H3N2) (55.3%) was the dominant subtype, followed by influenza B (30.9%; predominantly B/Yamagata-lineage) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (13.9%). Circulation of influenza viruses began earlier in 2014 and 2015 than previously described, coincident with the emergence of A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a, respectively. There was high diversity in the antigenicity of A(H3N2) viruses, and to a smaller extent influenza B viruses, during this period, with some mismatches with the northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations. All isolates tested were susceptible to the influenza antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Seasonal and year-round co-circulation of multiple influenza types/subtypes were detected in Cambodia during 2012-2015.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses, including genetic and antigenic diversity, but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Antivirals targeting the polymerase complex of influenza viruses.
Abstract: Current influenza antivirals have limitations with regard to their effectiveness and the potential emergence of resistance. Encouragingly, several new compounds which inhibit the polymerase of influenza viruses have recently been shown to have enhanced pre-clinical and clinical effectiveness compared to the neuraminidase inhibitors, the mainstay of influenza antiviral therapy over the last two decades. In this review we focus on four compounds which inhibit polymerase function, baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, pimodivir and AL-794 and discuss their clinical and virological effectiveness, their propensity to select for resistance and their potential for future combination therapy with the most commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of antiviral drugs targeting influenza polymerase, discussing effectiveness and resistance, but does not present explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses: an updated panorama analysis based on protein sequences.
Abstract: Type A influenza viruses (IAVs) cause significant infections in humans and multiple species of animals including pigs, horses, birds, dogs and some marine animals. They are of complicated phylogenetic diversity and distribution, and analysis of their phylogenetic diversity and distribution from a panorama view has not been updated for multiple years. 139,872 protein sequences of IAVs from GenBank were selected, and they were aligned and phylogenetically analyzed using the software tool MEGA 7.0. Lineages and subordinate lineages were classified according to the topology of the phylogenetic trees and the host, temporal and spatial distribution of the viruses, and designated using a novel universal nomenclature system. Large phylogenetic trees of the two external viral genes (HA and NA) and six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS) were constructed, and the diversity and the host, temporal and spatial distribution of these genes were calculated and statistically analyzed. Various features regarding the diversity and distribution of IAVs were confirmed, revised or added through this study, as compared with previous reports. Lineages and subordinate lineages were classified and designated for each of the genes based on the updated panorama views. The panorama views of phylogenetic diversity and distribution of IAVs and their nomenclature system were updated and assumed to be of significance for studies and communication of IAVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper provides a phylogenetic and diversity analysis of influenza A virus protein sequences without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Phylogeographic evidence for the inter- and intracontinental dissemination of avian influenza viruses via migration flyways.
Abstract: Genetically related highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of H5N6 subtype caused outbreaks simultaneously in East Asia and Europe-geographically distinct regions-during winter 2017-2018. This situation prompted us to consider whether the application of phylogeographic analysis to a particular gene segment of AIVs could provide clues for understanding how AIV had been disseminated across the continent. Here, the N6 NA genes of influenza viruses isolated across the world were subjected to phylogeographic analysis to illustrate the inter- and intracontinental dissemination of AIVs. Those isolated in East Asia during winter and in Mongolia/Siberia during summer were comingled within particular clades of the phylogeographic tree. For AIVs in one clade, their dissemination in eastern Eurasia extended from Yakutia, Russia, in the north to East Asia in the south. AIVs in western Asia, Europe, and Mongolia were also comingled within other clades, indicating that Mongolia/Siberia plays an important role in the dissemination of AIVs across the Eurasian continent. Mongolia/Siberia may therefore have played a role in the simultaneous outbreaks of H5N6 HPAIVs in Europe and East Asia during the winter of 2017-2018. In addition to the long-distance intracontinental disseminations described above, intercontinental disseminations of AIVs between Eurasia and Africa and between Eurasia and North America were also observed. Integrating these results and known migration flyways suggested that the migration of wild birds and the overlap of flyways, such as that observed in Mongolia/Siberia and along the Alaskan Peninsula, contributed to the long-distance intra- and intercontinental dissemination of AIVs. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the movement of migratory birds and the dynamics of AIVs in breeding areas-especially where several migration flyways overlap-in forecasting outbreaks caused by HPAIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses phylogeographic analysis of viral gene segments to understand virus dissemination, without explicit genotype-phenotype associations.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity in the United States During the 2018-19 Season and Composition of the 2019-20 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: Influenza activity* in the United States during the 2018-19 season (September 30, 2018-May 18, 2019) was of moderate severity (1). Nationally, influenza-like illness (ILI)<sup>†</sup> activity began increasing in November, peaked during mid-February, and returned to below baseline in mid-April; the season lasted 21 weeks,<sup>§</sup> making it the longest season in 10 years. Illness attributed to influenza A viruses predominated, with very little influenza B activity. Two waves of influenza A were notable during this extended season: influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from October 2018 to mid-February 2019 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses from February through May 2019. Compared with the 2017-18 influenza season, rates of hospitalization this season were lower for adults, but were similar for children. Although influenza activity is currently below surveillance baselines, testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should continue year-round. Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an epidemiological update on influenza activity and vaccine composition without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Report on influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in 2017.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a record total of 5866 human influenza positive samples during 2017. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties and were propagated in qualified cells and hens’ eggs for use as potential seasonal influenza vaccine virus candidates. In 2017, influenza A(H3) viruses predominated over influenza A(H1)pdm09 and B viruses, accounting for a total of 54% of all viruses analysed. The majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2017. However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the majority of circulating A(H3) viruses had undergone genetic drift relative to the WHO recommended vaccine strain for 2017. Of 3733 samples tested for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, only two A(H1)pdm09 viruses and one A(H3) virus showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, while just one A(H1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition by zanamivir.

Title: Prevalence of Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 4 and Co-Infection by Immunosuppressive Viruses in Fowl with Hydropericardium Hepatitis Syndrome in Shandong Province, China.
Abstract: Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the pathogenic agent of hydropericardium hepatitis syndrome (HHS) in chickens and ducks, which has caused huge economic losses for the Chinese poultry industry since 2015. In order to objectively determine the prevalence and co-infection status of the virus in Shandong province in China, we analyzed a total of 679 clinical cases of chickens and ducks from 36 farms in the province. The results showed that the FAdV-4 infection rate was 65.2% (443/679), and the rate in breeder ducks was almost two-fold higher than that in breeder chickens (68.57% vs. 34.30%). Notably, co-infection by H9N2 avian influenza virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and/or chicken infectious anemia virus was very common in the 443 FAdV-4-positive cases. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the hexon genes of four Shandong FAdV-4 isolates revealed that these strains clustered into Indian reference strains, indicating that the Shandong FAdV-4 strains might have originated in India. These findings provide the first data on the prevalence and co-infection status of FAdV-4 in Shandong province, which may serve as a foundation for the prevention of FAdV-4 in the field.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports prevalence and co-infection data and phylogenetic analysis but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses in waterfowl in Bangladesh.
Abstract: Bangladesh has reported repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses in poultry since 2007. Because of the large number of live poultry markets (LPM) relative to the population density of poultry throughout the country, these markets can serve as sentinel sites for HPAI A(H5) detection. Through active LPM surveillance during June 2016-June 2017, HPAI A(H5N6) viruses along with 14 other subtypes of influenza A viruses were detected. The HPAI A(H5N6) viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 and were likely introduced into Bangladesh around March 2016. Human infections with influenza clade 2.3.4.4 viruses in Bangladesh have not been identified, but the viruses had several molecular markers associated with potential human infection. Vigilant surveillance at the animal-human interface is essential to identify emerging avian influenza viruses with the potential to threaten public and animal health.

Title: Evaluation of Mannose Binding Lectin Gene Variants in Pediatric Influenza Virus-Related Critical Illness.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune protein with strong biologic plausibility for protecting against influenza virus-related sepsis and bacterial co-infection. In an autopsy cohort of 105 influenza-infected young people, carriage of the deleterious MBL gene <i>MBL2</i>_Gly54Asp("B") mutation was identified in 5 of 8 individuals that died from influenza-methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) co-infection. We evaluated <i>MBL2</i> variants known to influence MBL levels with pediatric influenza-related critical illness susceptibility and/or severity including with bacterial co-infections. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled children and adolescents with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection across 38 pediatric intensive care units from November 2008 to June 2016. We sequenced <i>MBL2</i> "low-producer" variants rs11003125("H/L"), rs7096206("Y/X"), rs1800450<sub>Gly54Asp</sub>("B"), rs1800451<sub>Gly57Glu</sub>("C"), rs5030737<sub>Arg52Cys</sub>("D") in patients and biologic parents. We measured serum levels and compared complement activity in low-producing homozygotes ("B/B," "C/C") to HYA/HYA controls. We used a population control of 1,142 healthy children and also analyzed family trios (PBAT/HBAT) to evaluate disease susceptibility, and nested case-control analyses to evaluate severity. <b>Results:</b> We genotyped 420 patients with confirmed influenza-related sepsis: 159 (38%) had acute lung injury (ALI), 165 (39%) septic shock, and 30 (7%) died. Although bacterial co-infection was diagnosed in 133 patients (32%), only MRSA co-infection (<i>n</i> = 33, 8% overall) was associated with death (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), present in 11 of 30 children that died (37%). <i>MBL2</i> variants predicted serum levels and complement activation as expected. We found no association between influenza-related critical illness susceptibility and <i>MBL2</i> variants using family trios (633 biologic parents) or compared to population controls. <i>MBL2</i> variants were not associated with admission illness severity, septic shock, ALI, or bacterial co-infection diagnosis. Carriage of low-MBL producing <i>MBL2</i> variants was not a risk factor for mortality, but children that died did have higher carriage of one or more B alleles (OR 2.3; <i>p</i> = 0.007), including 7 of 11 with influenza MRSA-related death (vs. 2 of 22 survivors: OR 14.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0002). <b>Conclusions:</b><i>MBL2</i> variants that decrease MBL levels were not associated with susceptibility to pediatric influenza-related critical illness or with multiple measures of critical illness severity. We confirmed a prior report of higher B allele carriage in a relatively small number of young individuals with influenza-MRSA associated death.

Title: Virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus in humans: a systemic literature review.
Abstract: H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) caused human infections in 2013 in China. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that H7N9 AIV is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential. We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development. We summarized virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and current diagnostic assays in H7N9 AIVs.
Relevant: False

Title: Comparative micro-epidemiology of pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreaks in a wild bird population.
Abstract: Understanding the epidemiological dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in wild birds is crucial for guiding effective surveillance and control measures. The spread of H5 HPAIV has been well characterized over large geographical and temporal scales. However, information about the detailed dynamics and demographics of individual outbreaks in wild birds is rare and important epidemiological parameters remain unknown. We present data from a wild population of long-lived birds (mute swans; Cygnus olor) that has experienced three outbreaks of related H5 HPAIVs in the past decade, specifically, H5N1 (2007), H5N8 (2016) and H5N6 (2017). Detailed demographic data were available and intense sampling was conducted before and after the outbreaks; hence the population is unusually suitable for exploring the natural epidemiology, evolution and ecology of HPAIV in wild birds. We show that key epidemiological features remain remarkably consistent across multiple outbreaks, including the timing of virus incursion and outbreak duration, and the presence of a strong age-structure in morbidity that likely arises from an equivalent age-structure in immunological responses. The predictability of these features across a series of outbreaks in a complex natural population is striking and contributes to our understanding of HPAIV in wild birds. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.

Title: A brief history of bird flu.
Abstract: In 1918, a strain of influenza A virus caused a human pandemic resulting in the deaths of 50 million people. A century later, with the advent of sequencing technology and corresponding phylogenetic methods, we know much more about the origins, evolution and epidemiology of influenza epidemics. Here we review the history of avian influenza viruses through the lens of their genetic makeup: from their relationship to human pandemic viruses, starting with the 1918 H1N1 strain, through to the highly pathogenic epidemics in birds and zoonoses up to 2018. We describe the genesis of novel influenza A virus strains by reassortment and evolution in wild and domestic bird populations, as well as the role of wild bird migration in their long-range spread. The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the zoonotic incursions of avian H5 and H7 viruses into humans over the last couple of decades are also described. The threat of a new avian influenza virus causing a human pandemic is still present today, although control in domestic avian populations can minimize the risk to human health. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.

Title: H1N1 hemagglutinin-specific HLA-DQ6-restricted CD4+ T cells can be readily detected in narcolepsy type 1 patients and healthy controls.
Abstract: Following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, an increased risk of narcolepsy type 1 was observed. Homology between an H1N1 hemagglutinin and two hypocretin sequences has been reported. T cell reactivity to these peptides was assessed in 81 narcolepsy type 1 patients and 19 HLA-DQ6-matched healthy controls. HLA-DQ6-restricted H1N1 hemagglutinin-specific T cell responses were detected in 28.4% of patients and 15.8% of controls. Despite structural homology between HLA-DQ6-hypocretin and -H1N1 peptide complexes, T cell cross-reactivity was not detected. These results indicate that it is unlikely that cross-reactivity between H1N1 hemagglutinin and hypocretin peptides presented by HLA-DQ6 is involved in the development of narcolepsy.
Relevant: False
Reason: Assesses T cell responses to H1N1 hemagglutinin peptides in patients and controls; no direct viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in a patient travelling from Shanghai to Italy in July 2018: an uncommon clinical presentation in a non-seasonal period.
Abstract: Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases in travellers, especially in those returning from subtropical and tropical regions. In late June 2018 an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was diagnosed in a 36-years-old man, returned from a travel in Shanghai and hospitalized at the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, with a diagnosis of fever and an uncommon clinical presentation characterised by a persistent leukopenia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a closeness with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in the US in May-June 2018. Prompt recognition of influenza infection led to a proper case management, demonstrating the crucial role of the continuous influenza surveillance programme.

Title: Continuing evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in Bangladeshi live poultry markets.
Abstract: Since November 2008, we have conducted active avian influenza surveillance in Bangladesh. Clades 2.2.2, 2.3.4.2, and 2.3.2.1a of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have all been identified in Bangladeshi live poultry markets (LPMs), although, since the end of 2014, H5N1 viruses have been exclusively from clade 2.3.2.1a. In June 2015, a new reassortant H5N1 virus (H5N1-R1) from clade 2.3.2.1a was identified, containing haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix genes of H5N1 viruses circulating in Bangladesh since 2011, plus five other genes of Eurasian-lineage low pathogenic avian influenza A (LPAI) viruses. Here we report the status of circulating avian influenza A viruses in Bangladeshi LPMs from March 2016 to January 2018. Until April 2017, H5N1 viruses exclusively belonged to H5N1-R1 clade 2.3.2.1a. However, in May 2017, we identified another reassortant H5N1 (H5N1-R2), also of clade 2.3.2.1a, wherein the PA gene segment of H5N1-R1 was replaced by that of another Eurasian-lineage LPAI virus related to A/duck/Bangladesh/30828/2016 (H3N8), detected in Bangladeshi LPM in September 2016. Currently, both reassortant H5N1-R1 and H5N1-R2 co-circulate in Bangladeshi LPMs. Furthermore, some LPAI viruses isolated from LPMs during 2016-2017 were closely related to those from ducks in free-range farms and wild birds in Tanguar haor, a wetland region of Bangladesh where ducks have frequent contact with migratory birds. These data support a hypothesis where Tanguar haor-like ecosystems provide a mechanism for movement of LPAI viruses to LPMs where reassortment with poultry viruses occurs adding to the diversity of viruses at this human-animal interface.
Relevant: False

Title: Whole-genome Sequencing Provides Data for Stratifying Infection Prevention and Control Management of Nosocomial Influenza A.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics in humans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequencing have traditionally been used to identify the virus genotype, although their utility in detecting outbreak clusters is still unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the utility, if any, of whole-genome sequencing over HA/NA sequencing for infection prevention and control (IPC) in hospitals. We obtained all clinical samples from influenza (H1N1)-positive patients at the Great Ormond Street Hospital between January and March 2016. Samples were sequenced using targeted enrichment on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Maximum likelihood trees were computed for both whole genomes and concatenated HA/NA sequences. Epidemiological data was taken from routine IPC team activity during the period. Complete genomes were obtained for 65/80 samples from 38 patients. Conventional IPC analysis recognized 1 outbreak, involving 3 children, and identified another potential cluster in the haemato-oncology ward. Whole-genome and HA/NA phylogeny both accurately identified the previously known outbreak cluster. However, HA/NA sequencing additionally identified unrelated strains as part of this outbreak cluster. A whole-genome analysis identified a further cluster of 2 infections that had been previously missed and refuted suspicions of transmission in the haemato-oncology wards. Whole-genome sequencing is better at identifying outbreak clusters in a hospital setting than HA/NA sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing could provide a faster and more reliable method for outbreak monitoring and supplement routine IPC team work to allow the prevention of transmission.

Reason: The study focuses on the utility of whole-genome sequencing for infection control and outbreak detection without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Abstract: Influenza virus neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid groups from cell glycoproteins, enabling release of the virus from host cells.

Title: CXCR6-Deficiency Improves the Control of Pulmonary <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and Influenza Infection Independent of T-Lymphocyte Recruitment to the Lungs.
Abstract: T-lymphocytes are critical for protection against respiratory infections, such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and influenza virus, with chemokine receptors playing an important role in directing these cells to the lungs. CXCR6 is expressed by activated T-lymphocytes and its ligand, CXCL16, is constitutively expressed by the bronchial epithelia, suggesting a role in T-lymphocyte recruitment and retention. However, it is unknown whether CXCR6 is required in responses to pulmonary infection, particularly on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes. Analysis of CXCR6-reporter mice revealed that in naïve mice, lung leukocyte expression of CXCR6 was largely restricted to a small population of T-lymphocytes, but this population was highly upregulated after either infection. Nevertheless, pulmonary infection of CXCR6-deficient mice with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> or recombinant influenza A virus expressing P25 peptide (rIAV-P25), an I-A<sup>b</sup>-restricted epitope from the immunodominant mycobacterial antigen, Ag85B, demonstrated that the receptor was redundant for recruitment of T-lymphocytes to the lungs. Interestingly, CXCR6-deficiency resulted in reduced bacterial burden in the lungs 6 weeks after <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection, and reduced weight loss after rIAV-P25 infection compared to wild type controls. This was paradoxically associated with a decrease in Th1-cytokine responses in the lung parenchyma. Adoptive transfer of P25-specific CXCR6-deficient T-lymphocytes into WT mice revealed that this functional change in Th1-cytokine production was not due to a T-lymphocyte intrinsic mechanism. Moreover, there was no reduction in the number or function of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory cells in the lungs of CXCR6-deficient mice. Although CXCR6 was not required for T-lymphocyte recruitment or retention in the lungs, CXCR6 influenced the kinetics of the inflammatory response so that deficiency led to increased host control of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the role of CXCR6 deficiency in immune response and infection control, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evidence of exposure and human seroconversion during an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) among poultry in Cameroon.
Abstract: From May 2016 to March 2017, 22 poultry outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) were reported in Cameroon, mainly in poultry farms and live bird markets. No human cases were reported. In this study, we sought to describe the 2016 A(H5N1) outbreak strain and to investigate the risk of infection in exposed individuals. We find that highly pathogenic influenza subtype A(H5N1), clade 2.3.2.1c from Cameroon is closely related phylogenetically and antigenically to strains isolated in central and western Africa at the time. No molecular markers of increased human transmissibility were noted; however, seroconversion was detected in two poultry workers (1.5% of total screened). Therefore, the continued outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry and the risk of zoonotic human infection highlight the crucial need for continued and vigilant influenza surveillance and research in Africa, especially in areas of high poultry trade, such as Cameroon.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes phylogenetic and antigenic relatedness of H5N1 strains and seroconversion in humans but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP).
Abstract: Subspecies nomenclature systems of pathogens are increasingly based on sequence data. The use of phylogenetics to identify and differentiate between clusters of genetically similar pathogens is particularly prevalent in virology from the nomenclature of human papillomaviruses to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx viruses. These nomenclature systems rely on absolute genetic distance thresholds to define the maximum genetic divergence tolerated between viruses designated as closely related. However, the phylogenetic clustering methods used in these nomenclature systems are limited by the arbitrariness of setting intra and intercluster diversity thresholds. The lack of a consensus ground truth to define well-delineated, meaningful phylogenetic subpopulations amplifies the difficulties in identifying an informative distance threshold. Consequently, phylogenetic clustering often becomes an exploratory, ad hoc exercise. Phylogenetic Clustering by Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP) was developed to provide a statistically principled phylogenetic clustering framework that negates the need for an arbitrarily defined distance threshold. Using the pairwise patristic distance distributions of an input phylogeny, PhyCLIP parameterizes the intra and intercluster divergence limits as statistical bounds in an integer linear programming model which is subsequently optimized to cluster as many sequences as possible. When applied to the hemagglutinin phylogeny of HPAI H5Nx viruses, PhyCLIP was not only able to recapitulate the current WHO/OIE/FAO H5 nomenclature system but also further delineated informative higher resolution clusters that capture geographically distinct subpopulations of viruses. PhyCLIP is pathogen-agnostic and can be generalized to a wide variety of research questions concerning the identification of biologically informative clusters in pathogen phylogenies.

Title: Viral infection detection using metagenomics technology in six poultry farms of eastern China.
Abstract: With rapidly increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements, new technologies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of pathogens in the occurrence and development of animal diseases. We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States, September 30, 2018-February 2, 2019.
Abstract: CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity and viruses in the United States. During September 30, 2018-February 2, 2019,* influenza activity<sup>†</sup> in the United States was low during October and November, increased in late December, and remained elevated through early February. As of February 2, 2019, this has been a low-severity influenza season (1), with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), lower rates of hospitalization, and fewer deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza, compared with recent seasons. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates among children are similar to those observed in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant seasons; 28 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2018-19 season have been reported to CDC. Whereas influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in most areas of the country, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated in the southeastern United States, and in recent weeks accounted for a growing proportion of influenza viruses detected in several other regions. Small numbers of influenza B viruses (<3% of all influenza-positive tests performed by public health laboratories) also were reported. The majority of the influenza viruses characterized antigenically are similar to the cell culture-propagated reference viruses representing the 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. Health care providers should continue to offer and encourage vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Finally, regardless of vaccination status, it is important that persons with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza complications be treated with antiviral medications.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a surveillance report summarizing influenza activity without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Dynamic Perspectives on the Search for a Universal Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: A universal influenza vaccine (UIV) could considerably alleviate the public health burden of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Although significant progress has been achieved in clarifying basic immunology and virology relating to UIV, several important questions relating to the dynamics of infection, immunity, and pathogen evolution remain unsolved. In this study, we review these gaps, which span integrative levels, from cellular to global and timescales from molecular events to decades. We argue that they can be best addressed by a tight integration of empirical (laboratory, epidemiological) research and theory and suggest fruitful areas for this synthesis. In particular, quantifying natural and vaccinal limitations on viral transmission are central to this effort.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses general challenges and perspectives on universal influenza vaccines without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Antibody Determinants of Influenza Immunity.
Abstract: Understanding antigenic variation in influenza virus strains and how the human immune system recognizes strains are central challenges for vaccinologists. Antibodies directed to the 2 major viral surface membrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), mediate protection against reinfection following natural infection or vaccination, but HA and NA protein sequences in field strains are highly variable. The central questions are how to achieve protective antibody responses in a higher proportion of individuals and how to induce responses with more breadth and durability. Studies using isolation of human monoclonal antibodies followed by structural and functional characterization revealed conserved antigenic sites recognized by broadly cross-reactive antibodies. The antigenic landscape on HA and NA proteins is coming into focus to inform studies of the correlates and mechanisms of immunity. Understanding the antibody determinants of influenza immunity points the way toward development and testing of next-generation vaccines with potential to confer broadly protective immunity.

Title: Neuraminidase, the Forgotten Surface Antigen, Emerges as an Influenza Vaccine Target for Broadened Protection.
Abstract: For 50 years it has been known that antibodies to neuraminidase (NA) protect against infection during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. However, NA is largely ignored in the formulation and standardization of our current influenza vaccines. There are a number of factors that contributed to this antigen being forgotten, including the lack of an easily performed test to measure NA antibody. With the availability of that test, it has been possible to show its independent contribution to protection in various situations. The challenge now is to make it possible to include known amounts of NA in investigational vaccines or to routinely measure NA content in licensed vaccines. Vaccines containing optimal amounts of NA may be particularly useful when there are antigenic changes, either drift or shift, in the hemagglutinin because NA immunity offers broad protection. It is now time to remember the NA as we work toward improved influenza vaccines.
Relevant: False
Reason: Discusses neuraminidase as a vaccine target and its role in protection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Making Universal Influenza Vaccines: Lessons From the 1918 Pandemic.
Abstract: The year 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history. In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza spread globally and caused an estimated 50-100 million deaths associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The descendants of the 1918 virus continue to circulate as annual epidemic viruses causing significant mortality each year. The 1918 influenza pandemic serves as a benchmark for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Challenges to producing a truly universal influenza vaccine include eliciting broad protection against antigenically different influenza viruses that can prevent or significantly downregulate viral replication and reduce morbidity by preventing development of viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Perhaps the most important goal of such vaccines is not to prevent influenza, but to prevent influenza deaths.
Relevant: False
Reason: Reviews lessons from the 1918 pandemic for universal vaccine development without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Development and evaluation of a new real-time RT-PCR assay for detecting the latest H9N2 influenza viruses capable of causing human infection.
Abstract: The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) has spread among domestic poultry and wild birds worldwide. H9N2 AIV is sporadically transmitted to humans from avian species. A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed cases of non-fatal human infection with the Eurasian Y280 and G1 lineages have been reported in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh and Egypt since 1997. H9N2 AIV infections in poultry have become endemic in Asia and the Middle East and are a major source of viral internal genes for other AIV subtypes, such that continuous monitoring of H9N2 AIV is recommended. In this study, a new, one-step, real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to detect two major Eurasian H9 lineages of AIV capable of causing human infection. The sensitivity of this assay was determined using in vitro-transcribed RNA, and the detection limit was approximately 3 copies/reaction. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed against RNA from H1-15 subtypes of influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses and other viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, this assay could detect the H9 hemagglutinin (HA) gene from artificially reconstituted clinical samples spiked with H9N2 virus without any non-specific reactions. Therefore, this assay is highly sensitive and specific for H9 HA detection. The assay is useful both for diagnostic purposes in cases of suspected human infection with influenza H9N2 viruses and for the surveillance of both avian and human influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: Describes development of a diagnostic RT-PCR assay for H9N2 detection without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Integration of genetic and epidemiological data to infer H5N8 HPAI virus transmission dynamics during the 2016-2017 epidemic in Italy.
Abstract: Between October 2016 and December 2017, several European Countries had been involved in a massive Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic sustained by H5N8 subtype virus. Starting on December 2016, also Italy was affected by H5N8 HPAI virus, with cases occurring in two epidemic waves: the first between December 2016 and May 2017, and the second in July-December 2017. Eighty-three outbreaks were recorded in poultry, 67 of which (80.72%) occurring in the second wave. A total of 14 cases were reported in wild birds. Epidemiological information and genetic analyses were conjointly used to get insight on the spread dynamics. Analyses indicated multiple introductions from wild birds to the poultry sector in the first epidemic wave, and noteworthy lateral spread from October 2017 in a limited geographical area with high poultry densities. Turkeys, layers and backyards were the mainly affected types of poultry production. Two genetic sub-groups were detected in the second wave in non-overlapping geographical areas, leading to speculate on the involvement of different wild bird populations. The integration of epidemiological data and genetic analyses allowed to unravel the transmission dynamics of H5N8 virus in Italy, and could be exploited to timely support in implementing tailored control measures.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper integrates genetic and epidemiological data to infer transmission dynamics but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The evolution and molecular characteristics of H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Jiangxi of China.
Abstract: To understand the evolution and molecular characteristics of Jiangxi H9N2 viruses, we isolated 17 viruses in 2011 and analyzed their characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that their hemagglutinin genes originate from JS/1/00-like sublineage, neuraminidase genes originate from BJ/94-like sublineage, PB1, PA, NP, and NS genes all come from SH/F/98-like sublineage, PB2 genes originate from ST/163/04-like sublineage, while M genes come from G1-like sublineage. Genotype analysis showed that our isolates were classified as genotype 57. Molecular analyses indicated that our strains contained specific sites characteristic of low-pathogenic viruses. The current study once again highlights the necessity for continued surveillance of novel H9N2 viruses.

Title: Consecutive influenza surveillance of neuraminidase mutations and neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in Japan.
Abstract: The large consumption of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) for the treatment of influenza virus infections places Japan at risk of becoming the epicenter of the global spread of NAI-resistant viruses. To clarify NA amino acid mutations of epidemic influenza viruses in Japan and their related NAI resistance. A total of 1791 samples, including 396 A/H1N1pdm09, 1117 A/H3N2, and 278 B isolates, were collected to determine of their 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> ) values by NAIs (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) during the Japanese seasons from 2011-2012 to 2016-2017. Then, 380 samples including 49 A/H1N1pdm09, 251 A/H3N2, and 80 B isolates were sequenced for the entire NA genes. Neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant A/H1N1pdm09 viruses were detected at a frequency of 1.3% (5/396 isolates) in the epidemic seasons. None of the A/H3N2 and B viruses developed resistance to any of the four NAIs during the six seasons. Only five and 13 AA mutations were detected in the NA catalytic sites of A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 viruses, respectively. No mutations were observed in the catalytic sites of B viruses. Four of the five mutations in the catalytic sites of A/H1N1pdm09 consisted of H275Y, which was related to high resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir. Most (10/13) of the catalytic site mutations in A/H3N2 were associated with MDCK-passaged induction (D151G/N). Finally, no mutations related to substantial NAI resistance were detected in the A/H3N2 and B viruses examined. These findings suggest that the NA catalytic sites of influenza viruses are well preserved. Even in Japan, no spread of NAI-resistant viruses has been observed, and A/H1N1pdm09 viruses carrying H275Y remain limited.

Reason: The study surveys neuraminidase mutations and resistance but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic outcomes beyond resistance prevalence.

Title: Immunodominance and Antigenic Variation of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin: Implications for Design of Universal Vaccine Immunogens.
Abstract: Influenza viruses routinely acquire mutations in their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins that abrogate binding of pre-existing antibodies in a process known as antigenic drift. Most human antibodies against HA and NA are directed against epitopes that are hypervariable and not against epitopes that are conserved among different influenza virus strains. Universal influenza vaccines are currently being developed to elicit protective responses against functionally conserved sites on influenza proteins where viral escape mutations can result in large fitness costs [1]. Universal vaccine targets include the highly conserved HA stem domain [2-12], the less conserved HA receptor-binding site (RBS) [13-16], as well as conserved sites on NA [17-19]. One central challenge of universal vaccine efforts is to steer human antibody responses away from immunodominant, variable epitopes and towards subdominant, functionally conserved sites. Overcoming this challenge will require further understanding of the structural basis of broadly neutralizing HA and NA antibody binding epitopes and factors that influence immunodominance hierarchies of human antibody responses.

Title: Monoclonal antibody against human Tim-3 enhances antiviral immune response.
Abstract: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim-3) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor in T cells and innate immune cells. The deregulated upregulation of Tim-3 is related to immune exhaustion in tumour and viral infection. To overcome Tim-3-mediated immune tolerance, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody against human Tim-3 (L3G) and investigated its roles in inhibiting Tim-3 signalling and overcoming immune tolerance in T cells and monocytes/macrophages. The administration of L3G to cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) significantly increased the production of IFN-γ and IL-2 and the expression of type I interferon. The administration of L3G also increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-8 and type I interferon in U937 cells and primary monocytes. We investigated the mechanisms by which L3G enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and our data show that L3G enhances STAT1 phosphorylation in both monocytes/macrophages and T cells. Finally, in an H1N1 infection model of PBMCs and U937 cells, L3G decreased the viral load and enhanced the expression of interferon. Thus, we developed a functional antibody with therapeutic potential against Tim-3-mediated infection tolerance.

Title: Evidence of a fixed internal gene constellation in influenza A viruses isolated from wild birds in Argentina (2006-2016).
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are the major reservoir of influenza A virus. Cloacal swabs and feces samples (n = 6595) were collected from 62 bird species in Argentina from 2006 to 2016 and screened for influenza A virus. Full genome sequencing of 15 influenza isolates from 6 waterfowl species revealed subtypes combinations that were previously described in South America (H1N1, H4N2, H4N6 (n = 3), H5N3, H6N2 (n = 4), and H10N7 (n = 2)), and new ones not previously identified in the region (H4N8, H7N7 and H7N9). Notably, the internal gene segments of all 15 Argentine isolates belonged to the South American lineage, showing a divergent evolution of these viruses in the Southern Hemisphere. Time-scaled phylogenies indicated that South American gene segments diverged between ~ 30 and ~ 140 years ago from the most closely related influenza lineages, which include the avian North American (PB1, HA, NA, MP, and NS-B) and Eurasian lineage (PB2), and the equine H3N8 lineage (PA, NP, and NS-A). Phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene segments of the H4, H6, and N8 subtypes revealed recent introductions and reassortment between viruses from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the Americas. Remarkably and despite evidence of recent hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype introductions, the phylogenetic composition of internal gene constellation of these influenza A viruses has remained unchanged. Considering the extended time and the number of sampled species of the current study, and the paucity of previously available data, our results contribute to a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of influenza virus in South America.

Title: Comparison of 2016-17 and Previous Epizootics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 Guangdong Lineage in Europe.
Abstract: We analyzed the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 epizootic of 2016-17 in Europe by epidemiologic and genetic characteristics and compared it with 2 previous epizootics caused by the same H5 Guangdong lineage. The 2016-17 epizootic was the largest in Europe by number of countries and farms affected and greatest diversity of wild birds infected. We observed significant differences among the 3 epizootics regarding region affected, epidemic curve, seasonality, and outbreak duration, making it difficult to predict future HPAI epizootics. However, we know that in 2005-06 and 2016-17 the initial peak of wild bird detections preceded the peak of poultry outbreaks within Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of 2016-17 viruses indicates 2 main pathways into Europe. Our findings highlight the need for global surveillance of viral changes to inform disease preparedness, detection, and control.

Title: A Fréchet tree distance measure to compare phylogeographic spread paths across trees.
Abstract: Phylogeographic methods reconstruct the origin and spread of taxa by inferring locations for internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree from sampling locations of genetic sequences. This is commonly applied to study pathogen outbreaks and spread. To evaluate such reconstructions, the inferred spread paths from root to leaf nodes should be compared to other methods or references. Usually, ancestral state reconstructions are evaluated by node-wise comparisons, therefore requiring the same tree topology, which is usually unknown. Here, we present a method for comparing phylogeographies across different trees inferred from the same taxa. We compare paths of locations by calculating discrete Fréchet distances. By correcting the distances by the number of paths going through a node, we define the Fréchet tree distance as a distance measure between phylogeographies. As an application, we compare phylogeographic spread patterns on trees inferred with different methods from hemagglutinin sequences of H5N1 influenza viruses, finding that both tree inference and ancestral reconstruction cause variation in phylogeographic spread that is not directly reflected by topological differences. The method is suitable for comparing phylogeographies inferred with different tree or phylogeographic inference methods to each other or to a known ground truth, thus enabling a quality assessment of such techniques.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a computational method for comparing phylogeographic spread and does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Causes and Consequences of Spatial Within-Host Viral Spread.
Abstract: The spread of viral pathogens both between and within hosts is inherently a spatial process. While the spatial aspects of viral spread at the epidemiological level have been increasingly well characterized, the spatial aspects of viral spread within infected hosts are still understudied. Here, with a focus on influenza A viruses (IAVs), we first review experimental studies that have shed light on the mechanisms and spatial dynamics of viral spread within hosts. These studies provide strong empirical evidence for highly localized IAV spread within hosts. Since mathematical and computational within-host models have been increasingly used to gain a quantitative understanding of observed viral dynamic patterns, we then review the (relatively few) computational modeling studies that have shed light on possible factors that structure the dynamics of spatial within-host IAV spread. These factors include the dispersal distance of virions, the localization of the immune response, and heterogeneity in host cell phenotypes across the respiratory tract. While informative, we find in these studies a striking absence of theoretical expectations of how spatial dynamics may impact the dynamics of viral populations. To mitigate this, we turn to the extensive ecological and evolutionary literature on range expansions to provide informed theoretical expectations. We find that factors such as the type of density dependence, the frequency of long-distance dispersal, specific life history characteristics, and the extent of spatial heterogeneity are critical factors affecting the speed of population spread and the genetic composition of spatially expanding populations. For each factor that we identified in the theoretical literature, we draw parallels to its analog in viral populations. We end by discussing current knowledge gaps related to the spatial component of within-host IAV spread and the potential for within-host spatial considerations to inform the development of disease control strategies.

Title: Human CCR5Δ32 (rs333) polymorphism has no influence on severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Brazilian patients from the post pandemic period.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute and highly contagious viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality. The identification of host genetic factors associated with susceptibility and severity of influenza virus infection is of paramount importance. Previous studies evaluating the potential involvement of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism (rs333), a 32 base pair deletion in CC motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene, in severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected individuals have been reported, but their results are quite conflicting. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the CCR5Δ32 frequency in individuals with mild, severe and fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and its putative association with clinical and epidemiologic data. A total of 432 individuals were included in this study and classified according to their clinical status, into the following groups: influenza like illness (ILI) (n = 153); severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (n = 173) and fatal (n = 106) cases. The samples were collected in the post pandemic period, from 2012 to 2018. Individuals were further stratified according to their clinical and epidemiological data. The CCR5Δ32 variant was genotyped by PCR amplification and a subset of samples was further submitted to Sanger sequencing. The different clinical groups (ILI, SARI and fatal) presented similar distribution of wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and CCR5Δ32 allele frequencies. Genotype Δ32/Δ32 was not detected in our study. Additionally, no association between wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and dyspnea, a clinical factor for influenza complications was found. Similarly, no significant differences in the distribution of wt/wt and wt/Δ32 genotypes and CCR5Δ32 variant allele frequencies were observed in samples from the different Brazilian geographical regions. The CCR5Δ32 variant does not influence the susceptibility to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 severe disease or mortality in individuals from Brazil.

Title: ISU FLUture: a veterinary diagnostic laboratory web-based platform to monitor the temporal genetic patterns of Influenza A virus in swine.
Abstract: Influenza A Virus (IAV) causes respiratory disease in swine and is a zoonotic pathogen. Uncontrolled IAV in swine herds not only affects animal health, it also impacts production through increased costs associated with treatment and prevention efforts. The Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) diagnoses influenza respiratory disease in swine and provides epidemiological analyses on samples submitted by veterinarians. To assess the incidence of IAV in swine and inform stakeholders, the ISU FLUture website was developed as an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration of the ISU VDL swine IAV aggregate data in the clinical diagnostic database. The information associated with diagnostic cases has varying levels of completeness and is anonymous, but minimally contains: sample collection date, specimen type, and IAV subtype. Many IAV positive samples are sequenced, and in these cases, the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence and genetic classification are completed. These data are collected and presented on ISU FLUture in near real-time, and more than 6,000 IAV positive diagnostic cases and their epidemiological and evolutionary information since 2003 are presented to date. The database and web interface provides rapid and unique insight into the trends of IAV derived from both large- and small-scale swine farms across the United States of America. ISU FLUture provides a suite of web-based tools to allow stakeholders to search for trends and correlations in IAV case metadata in swine from the ISU VDL. Since the database infrastructure is updated in near real-time and is integrated within a high-volume veterinary diagnostic laboratory, earlier detection is now possible for emerging IAV in swine that subsequently cause vaccination and control challenges. The access to real-time swine IAV data provides a link with the national USDA swine IAV surveillance system and allows veterinarians to make objective decisions regarding the management and control of IAV in swine. The website is publicly accessible at http://influenza.cvm.iastate.edu .

Title: Virus-virus interactions and host ecology are associated with RNA virome structure in wild birds.
Abstract: Little is known about the factors that shape the ecology of RNA viruses in nature. Wild birds are an important case in point, as other than influenza A virus, avian samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA-sequencing ("meta-transcriptomics"), we revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of the ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. The viruses identified included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. Additionally, we identified novel virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked Avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from Australia's arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, May 20-October 13, 2018.
Abstract: During May 20-October 13, 2018,* low levels of influenza activity were reported in the United States, with a mix of influenza A and B viruses circulating. Seasonal influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere was low overall, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in many regions. Antigenic testing of available influenza A and B viruses indicated that no significant antigenic drift in circulating viruses had emerged. In late September, the components for the 2019 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine were selected and included an incremental update to the A(H3N2) vaccine virus used in egg-based vaccine manufacturing; no change was recommended for the A(H3N2) component of cell-manufactured or recombinant influenza vaccines. Annual influenza vaccination is the best method for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should receive influenza vaccine, preferably before the onset of influenza circulation in their community, which often begins in October and peaks during December-February. Health care providers should offer vaccination by the end of October and should continue to recommend and administer influenza vaccine to previously unvaccinated patients throughout the 2018-19 influenza season (1). In addition, during May 20-October 13, a small number of nonhuman influenza "variant" virus infections<sup>†</sup> were reported in the United States; most were associated with exposure to swine. Although limited human-to-human transmission might have occurred in one instance, no ongoing community transmission was identified.

Title: Loss of T-bet confers survival advantage to influenza-bacterial superinfection.
Abstract: The transcription factor, T-bet, regulates type 1 inflammatory responses against a range of infections. Here, we demonstrate a previously unaddressed role of T-bet, to influenza virus and bacterial superinfection. Interestingly, we found that T-bet deficiency did not adversely affect the efficacy of viral clearance or recovery compared to wild-type hosts. Instead, increased infiltration of neutrophils and production of Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22), in lungs of influenza virus-infected T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice, were correlated with survival advantage against subsequent infection by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> Neutralization of IL-17, but not IL-22, in T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice increased pulmonary bacterial load, concomitant with decreased neutrophil infiltration and reduced survival of T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> mice. IL-17 production by CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and γδ T cell types was identified to contribute to this protection against bacterial superinfection. We further showed that neutrophil depletion in T-bet<sup>-/-</sup> lungs increased pulmonary bacterial burden. These results thus indicate that despite the loss of T-bet, immune defences required for influenza viral clearance are fully functional, which in turn enhances protective type 17 immune responses against lethal bacterial superinfections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune factors (T-bet) and immune response to influenza and bacterial superinfection, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiology of circulating human influenza viruses from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2015.
Abstract: The establishment of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in Kinshasa, Bas Congo, Maniema, Katanga, and Kasai Provinces allowed generation of important data on the molecular epidemiology of human influenza viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, some challenges still exist, including the need for extending the influenza surveillance to more provinces. This study describes the pattern of influenza virus circulating in DRC during 2015. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from January to December 2015 from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and in all hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). Molecular analysis was done to determine influenza type and subtype at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Kinshasa using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of antiviral resistance by enzyme inhibition assay and nucleotide sequencing was performed by the Collaborating center in the USA (CDC, Atlanta). Out of 2,376 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients, 218 (9.1%) were positive for influenza virus. Among the positive samples, 149 were characterized as influenza virus type A (Flu A), 67 as type B (Flu B) and 2 mixed infections (Flu A and B). Flu A subtypes detected were H3N2 and H1N1. The Yamagata strain of Flu B was detected among patients in the country. Individuals aged between 5 and 14 years accounted for the largest age group affected by influenza virus. All influenza viruses detected were found to be sensitive to antiviral drugs such as oseltamivar, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivar. The present study documented the possible involvement of both circulation of Flu A and B viruses in human respiratory infection in certain DRC provinces during 2015. This study emphasises the need to extend the influenza surveillance to other provinces for a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in DRC. It is envisioned that such a system would lead to improved disease control and patient management.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on molecular epidemiology and surveillance data of influenza viruses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Mathematical Analysis of Influenza A Dynamics in the Emergence of Drug Resistance.
Abstract: Every year, influenza causes high morbidity and mortality especially among the immunocompromised persons worldwide. The emergence of drug resistance has been a major challenge in curbing the spread of influenza. In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated and used to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza A virus having incorporated the aspect of drug resistance. The qualitative analysis of the model is given in terms of the control reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>c</sub>. The model equilibria are computed and stability analysis carried out. The model is found to exhibit backward bifurcation prompting the need to lower <i>R</i><sub>c</sub> to a critical value <i>R</i><sub>c</sub><sup><i>∗</i></sup> for effective disease control. Sensitivity analysis results reveal that vaccine efficacy is the parameter with the most control over the spread of influenza. Numerical simulations reveal that despite vaccination reducing the reproduction number below unity, influenza still persists in the population. Hence, it is essential, in addition to vaccination, to apply other strategies to curb the spread of influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study analyzing influenza transmission dynamics and drug resistance without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: System for the heterologous expression of NS1 protein of H9N2 avian influenza virus in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila.
Abstract: Tetrahymena is commonly used as an alternative eukaryotic system for efficiently expressing heterologous genes. In this study, we inserted the non-structural (NS) 1 gene of avian influenza virus (AIV) into the shuttle vector pD5H8 and transformed conjugating T. thermophila with the recombinant plasmid pD5H8-NS1 by particle bombardment. Positive transformants were selected with paromomycin. We demonstrated that the NS1 protein could be expressed steadily following induction with cadmium in this Tetrahymena system. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection method was preliminary established using the expressed protein as coating antigens for serodiagnosis. This is the first study in which a Tetrahymena expression system was employed for the expression of the AIV NS1 protein, and it provides a good basis for the development of differential diagnostic kits and vaccines for the prevention and control of avian influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes heterologous expression of NS1 protein in Tetrahymena without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences based on a novel k-mer natural vector method.
Abstract: Based on the k-mer model for protein sequence, a novel k-mer natural vector method is proposed to characterize the features of k-mers in a protein sequence, in which the numbers and distributions of k-mers are considered. It is proved that the relationship between a protein sequence and its k-mer natural vector is one-to-one. Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences therefore can be easily performed without requiring evolutionary models or human intervention. In addition, there exists no a criterion to choose a suitable k, and k has a great influence on obtaining results as well as computational complexity. In this paper, a compound k-mer natural vector is utilized to quantify each protein sequence. The results gotten from phylogenetic analysis on three protein datasets demonstrate that our new method can precisely describe the evolutionary relationships of proteins, and greatly heighten the computing efficiency.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a computational method for phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Genetic characteristics of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from free-range poultry in Eastern China, in 2014-2015.
Abstract: Circulating H7N9 influenza viruses in live poultry markets continue to pose a threat to human health. Free-range poultry, one of the sources for these markets, are common in China as well as in many developing countries. Because the H9N2 virus could be a source of internal genes for the H7N9 virus, we conducted surveillance in free-range poultry and live poultry markets to study the evolution of H7N9 and H9N2 viruses in Eastern China. We found 28 samples positive for the H9N2 virus (a rate of 3.2%), but no positive samples for the H7N9 virus. Six representative H9N2 isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and the results showed that these viruses shared high nucleotide identities (99.0 to 100%) and were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees. All these 6 viruses are closely clustered with Zhejiang H9N2 chicken isolates, and belonged to genotype G57, along with some novel H7N9 strains and H9N2 strains circulating in humans in China. We hope that surveillance of AIVs in free-range poultry will be strengthened for further identification more genetic diversity.

Title: The Pandemic Threat of Emerging H5 and H7 Avian Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: The 1918 H1N1 Spanish Influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in modern history. Unlike more recent pandemics, most of the 1918 H1N1 virus' genome was derived directly from an avian influenza virus. Recent avian-origin H5 A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GsGd) and Asian H7N9 viruses have caused several hundred human infections with high mortality rates. While these viruses have not spread beyond infected individuals, if they evolve the ability to transmit efficiently from person-to-person, specifically via the airborne route, they will initiate a pandemic. Therefore, this review examines H5 GsGd and Asian H7N9 viruses that have caused recent zoonotic infections with a focus on viral properties that support airborne transmission. Several GsGd H5 and Asian H7N9 viruses display molecular changes that potentiate transmission and/or exhibit ability for limited transmission between ferrets. However, the hemagglutinin of these viruses is unstable; this likely represents the most significant obstacle to the emergence of a virus capable of efficient airborne transmission. Given the global disease burden of an influenza pandemic, continued surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts against H5 GsGd and Asian lineage H7N9 viruses are warranted.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review focusing on viral properties related to transmission and pandemic potential but does not provide explicit experimental links between genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Repeated detection of H7N9 avian influenza viruses in raw poultry meat illegally brought to Japan by international flight passengers.
Abstract: H7N9 highly and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV and LPAIV, respectively) have been isolated from duck meat products that were brought illegally into Japan by flight passengers in their hand luggage. These H7N9 virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevailing in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV isolate was slightly different from those of the H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 strains. These meat products contaminated with AIVs repeatedly brought into Japan lead to increased risks of poultry and public health. Continuous border disease control based on the detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is, thus, essential for the prevention of introduction and spread of AIVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of H7N9 viruses but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Characterization of avian influenza virus attachment patterns to human and pig tissues.
Abstract: Wild birds of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Occasionally, IAVs transmit and adapt to mammalian hosts, and are maintained as epidemic strains in their new hosts. Viral adaptions to mammalian hosts include altered receptor preference of host epithelial sialylated oligosaccharides from terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) towards α2,6-linked SA. However, α2,3-linked SA has been found in human respiratory tract epithelium, and human infections by avian IAVs (AIVs) have been reported. To further explore the attachment properties of AIVs, four AIVs of different subtypes were investigated on human and pig tissues using virus histochemistry. Additionally, glycan array analysis was performed for further characterization of IAVs' receptor structure tropism. Generally, AIV attachment was more abundant to human tissues than to pig tissues. The attachment pattern was very strong to human conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract, but variable to the lower respiratory tract. AIVs mainly attached to α2,3-linked SA, but also to combinations of α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA. The low attachment of these AIV isolates to pig tissues, but high attachment to human tissues, addresses the question whether AIVs in general require passage through pigs to obtain adaptions towards mammalian receptor structures.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes virus attachment patterns to tissues but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A(H5N1) viruses with A(H9N2) single gene (matrix or PB1) reassortment isolated from Cambodian live bird markets.
Abstract: Live bird market surveillance for avian influenza viruses in Cambodia in 2015 has led to the detection of two 7:1 reassortant influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1c viruses. These reassortant strains, designated A/duck/Cambodia/Z564W35M1/2015 and A/chicken/Cambodia/Z850W49M1/2015, both contained a single gene (PB1 and matrix gene, respectively) from concurrently circulating A(H9N2) influenza viruses. All other viral genes from both isolates clustered with A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1 viruses. Continued and prolonged co-circulation of influenza A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) viruses in Cambodian live bird markets may present a risk for the emergence of novel influenza reassortant viruses with negative agricultural and/or public health implications.
Relevant: False

Title: Evolutionary study and phylodynamic pattern of human influenza A/H3N2 virus in Indonesia from 2008 to 2010.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are by nature unstable with high levels of mutations. The sequential accumulation of mutations in the surface glycoproteins allows the virus to evade the neutralizing antibodies. The consideration of the tropics as the influenza reservoir where viral genetic and antigenic diversity are continually generated and reintroduced into temperate countries makes the study of influenza virus evolution in Indonesia essential. A total of 100 complete coding sequences (CDS) of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) genes of H3N2 virus were obtained from archived samples of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) surveillance collected from 2008 to 2010. Our evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses provide insight into the dynamic changes of Indonesian H3N2 virus from 2008 to 2010. Obvious antigenic drift with typical 'ladder-like' phylogeny was observed with multiple lineages found in each year, suggesting co-circulation of H3N2 strains at different time periods. The mutational pattern of the Indonesian H3N2 virus was not geographically related as relatively low levels of mutations with similar pattern of relative genetic diversity were observed in various geographical origins. This study reaffirms that the existence of a particular lineage is most likely the result of adaptation or competitive exclusion among different host populations and combination of stochastic ecological factors, rather than its geographical origin alone.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of H3N2 viruses without explicit links between genotype and phenotype.

Title: Reemergence of H3N8 Equine Influenza A virus in Chile, 2018.
Abstract: A new outbreak of equine Influenza A virus (IAV) was reported in Chile in January 2018, 6 years after its last report in 2012. Equine IAV was detected by rtRT-PCR, followed by virus isolation and full genome sequencing. Genetic characterization of equine IAV classified the virus within clade 1 of the Florida sublineage. Although this is the same sublineage that caused an outbreak in Chile in 2012, the virus has a high similarity to other cocirculating viruses that were recently identified in Europe and Asia. The Chilean 2018 equine influenza (EI) outbreak was caused by an H3N8 strain circulating globally that spread through horse movements.

Title: Biosensor-based epitope mapping of antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Characterization of the epitopes on antigen recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) is useful for the development of therapeutic antibodies, diagnostic tools, and vaccines. Epitope mapping also provides functional information for sequence-based repertoire analysis of antibody response to pathogen infection and/or vaccination. However, development of mapping strategies has lagged behind mAb discovery. We have developed a site-directed mutagenesis approach that can be used in conjunction with bio-layer interferometry (BLI) biosensors to map mAb epitopes. By generating a panel of single point mutants in the recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of influenza A viruses, we have characterized the epitopes of hundreds of mAbs targeting the H1 and H3 subtypes of HA and the N9 subtype of NA.

Title: αv Integrins regulate germinal center B cell responses through noncanonical autophagy.
Abstract: Germinal centers (GCs) are major sites of clonal B cell expansion and generation of long-lived, high-affinity antibody responses to pathogens. Signaling through TLRs on B cells promotes many aspects of GC B cell responses, including affinity maturation, class switching, and differentiation into long-lived memory and plasma cells. A major challenge for effective vaccination is identifying strategies to specifically promote GC B cell responses. Here, we have identified a mechanism of regulation of GC B cell TLR signaling, mediated by αv integrins and noncanonical autophagy. Using B cell-specific αv-KO mice, we show that loss of αv-mediated TLR regulation increased GC B cell expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching, and generation of long-lived plasma cells after immunization with virus-like particles (VLPs) or antigens associated with TLR ligand adjuvants. Furthermore, targeting αv-mediated regulation increased the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to influenza virus vaccination. These data therefore identify a mechanism of regulation of GC B cells that can be targeted to enhance antibody responses to vaccination.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates αv integrins' role in regulating germinal center B cell responses and antibody production but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Comparative studies of alignment, alignment-free and SVM based approaches for predicting the hosts of viruses based on viral sequences.
Abstract: Predicting the hosts of newly discovered viruses is important for pandemic surveillance of infectious diseases. We investigated the use of alignment-based and alignment-free methods and support vector machine using mononucleotide frequency and dinucleotide bias to predict the hosts of viruses, and applied these approaches to three datasets: rabies virus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. For coronavirus, we used the spike gene sequences, while for rabies and influenza A viruses, we used the more conserved nucleoprotein gene sequences. We compared the three methods under different scenarios and showed that their performances are highly correlated with the variability of sequences and sample size. For conserved genes like the nucleoprotein gene, longer k-mers than mono- and dinucleotides are needed to better distinguish the sequences. We also showed that both alignment-based and alignment-free methods can accurately predict the hosts of viruses. When alignment is difficult to achieve or highly time-consuming, alignment-free methods can be a promising substitute to predict the hosts of new viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares computational methods for predicting viral hosts based on sequences but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylodynamic Model Adequacy Using Posterior Predictive Simulations.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur, such that, it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy, a package for the popular BEAST2 software that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analyzing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1 influenza data were best described by the birth-death susceptible-infected-recovered model.

Abstract: The United States 2017-18 influenza season (October 1, 2017-May 19, 2018) was a high severity season with high levels of outpatient clinic and emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), high influenza-related hospitalization rates, and elevated and geographically widespread influenza activity across the country for an extended period. Nationally, ILI activity began increasing in November, reaching an extended period of high activity during January-February, and remaining elevated through March. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated through February and were predominant overall for the season; influenza B viruses predominated from March onward.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2010.
Abstract: The 2010 influenza season was moderate overall, with more laboratory-confirmed cases than in earlier years (with the exception of 2009). That said, self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was equal to or lower than 2008 and earlier years. In 2010, the number of laboratory-confirmed notifications for influenza was 0.8 times the 5-year mean. High notification rates were reflected in an increase in presentations with ILI to sentinel general practices and emergency departments. Notification rates were highest in the 0-4 year age group. Infections during the season were predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with 90% of notifications being influenza A (56% A(H1N)1pdm09, 30% A(unsubtyped) and 4% A(H3N2)) and 10% being influenza B. The A(H1), A(H3) and B influenza viruses circulating during the 2010 season were antigenically similar to the respective 2010 vaccine strains. Almost all (99%) of the circulating influenza B viruses that were analysed were from the B/Victoria lineage.

Title: Discovery of Highly Potent Pinanamine-Based Inhibitors against Amantadine- and Oseltamivir-Resistant Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza pandemic is a constant major threat to public health caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs). IAVs are subcategorized by the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in which they are both essential targets for drug discovery. While it is of great concern that NA inhibitor oseltamivir resistant strains are frequently identified from human or avian influenza virus, structural and functional characterization of influenza HA has raised hopes for new antiviral therapies. In this study, we explored a structure-activity relationship (SAR) of pinanamine-based antivirals and discovered a potent inhibitor M090 against amantadine-resistant viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strains, and oseltamivir-resistant viruses. Mechanism of action studies, particularly hemolysis inhibition, indicated that M090 targets influenza HA and it occupied a highly conserved pocket of the HA<sub>2</sub> domain and inhibited virus-mediated membrane fusion by "locking" the bending state of HA<sub>2</sub> during the conformational rearrangement process. This work provides new binding sites within the HA protein and indicates that this pocket may be a promising target for broad-spectrum anti-influenza A drug design and development.

Title: MASCOT: parameter and state inference under the marginal structured coalescent approximation.
Abstract: The structured coalescent is widely applied to study demography within and migration between sub-populations from genetic sequence data. Current methods are either exact but too computationally inefficient to analyse large datasets with many sub-populations, or make strong approximations leading to severe biases in inference. We recently introduced an approximation based on weaker assumptions to the structured coalescent enabling the analysis of larger datasets with many different states. We showed that our approximation provides unbiased migration rate and population size estimates across a wide parameter range. We extend this approach by providing a new algorithm to calculate the probability of the state of internal nodes that includes the information from the full phylogenetic tree. We show that this algorithm is able to increase the probability attributed to the true sub-population of a node. Furthermore we use improved integration techniques, such that our method is now able to analyse larger datasets, including a H3N2 dataset with 433 sequences sampled from five different locations. The presented methods are part of the BEAST2 package MASCOT, the Marginal Approximation of the Structured COalescenT. This package can be downloaded via the BEAUti package manager.

Title: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H9N2 are in the course of reassorting into novel AIVs.
Abstract: In 2013, two episodes of influenza emerged in China and caused worldwide concern. A new H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) first appeared in China on February 19, 2013. By August 31, 2013, the virus had spread to ten provinces and two metropolitan cities. Of 134 patients with H7N9 influenza, 45 died. From then on, epidemics emerged sporadically in China and resulted in several victims. On November 30, 2013, a 73-year-old woman presented with an influenza-like illness. She developed multiple organ failure and died 9 d after the onset of disease. A novel reassortant AIV, H10N8, was isolated from a tracheal aspirate specimen that was obtained from the patient 7 d after onset. This case was the first human case of influenza A subtype H10N8. On 4 February, 2014, another death due to H10N8 avian influenza was reported in Jiangxi Province, China.

Title: Natural Killer Cell Recruitment to the Lung During Influenza A Virus Infection Is Dependent on CXCR3, CCR5, and Virus Exposure Dose.
Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells are vital components of the antiviral immune response, but their contributions in defense against influenza A virus (IAV) are not well understood. To better understand NK cell responses during IAV infections, we examined the magnitude, kinetics, and contribution of NK cells to immunity and protection during high- and low-dose IAV infections. Herein, we demonstrate an increased accumulation of NK cells in the lung in high-dose vs. low-dose infections. In part, this increase is due to the local proliferation of pulmonary NK cells. However, the majority of NK cell accumulation within the lungs and airways during an IAV infection is due to recruitment that is partially dependent upon CXCR3 and CCR5, respectively. Therefore, altogether, our results demonstrate that NK cells are actively recruited to the lungs and airways during IAV infection and that the magnitude of the recruitment may relate to the inflammatory environment found within the tissues during high- and low-dose IAV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies NK cell recruitment during influenza infection, focusing on immune response rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Treemmer: a tool to reduce large phylogenetic datasets with minimal loss of diversity.
Abstract: Large sequence datasets are difficult to visualize and handle. Additionally, they often do not represent a random subset of the natural diversity, but the result of uncoordinated and convenience sampling. Consequently, they can suffer from redundancy and sampling biases. Here we present Treemmer, a simple tool to evaluate the redundancy of phylogenetic trees and reduce their complexity by eliminating leaves that contribute the least to the tree diversity. Treemmer can reduce the size of datasets with different phylogenetic structures and levels of redundancy while maintaining a sub-sample that is representative of the original diversity. Additionally, it is possible to fine-tune the behavior of Treemmer including any kind of meta-information, making Treemmer particularly useful for empirical studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper describes a computational tool for phylogenetic dataset reduction without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic and evolutionary analysis of emerging H3N2 canine influenza virus.
Abstract: The H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) originated from an avian species. Since its emergence, it has circulated in multiple states and has caused pandemics among dog populations; however, no comprehensive studies have explored the causes driving these ongoing cases. The study of the codon usage patterns of viruses can reveal the genetic changes required for the viruses to adapt to new hosts and the external environment. Here we performed a thorough genetic, evolutionary, and codon usage analysis. We identified three evolutionary H3N2 CIV clades from a timescaled phylogenetic tree, namely, Origin, China, and Korea/USA, by principal component analysis (PCA). Additionally, we found a low codon usage bias and that mutation pressure, natural selection, and dinucleotide abundance shape the codon usage bias of H3N2 CIVs, with natural selection being more crucial than the others. Moreover, the human codon adaptation index was similar to that of dogs (the natural host) and cats. In addition, the H3N2 CIV similarity index values were higher than those of the avian influenza virus (AIV), suggesting viral adaptation to the host. Therefore, H3N2 CIVs may pose a potential risk to public health in the future, and further epidemiologic, evolutionary, and pathogenetic studies are required.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic and evolutionary analysis and codon usage patterns of H3N2 canine influenza virus but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Neutral Theory and Rapidly Evolving Viral Pathogens.
Abstract: The evolution of viral pathogens is shaped by strong selective forces that are exerted during jumps to new hosts, confrontations with host immune responses and antiviral drugs, and numerous other processes. However, while undeniably strong and frequent, adaptive evolution is largely confined to small parts of information-packed viral genomes, and the majority of observed variation is effectively neutral. The predictions and implications of the neutral theory have proven immensely useful in this context, with applications spanning understanding within-host population structure, tracing the origins and spread of viral pathogens, predicting evolutionary dynamics, and modeling the emergence of drug resistance. We highlight the multiple ways in which the neutral theory has had an impact, which has been accelerated in the age of high-throughput, high-resolution genomics.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a theoretical review on neutral theory and viral evolution without explicit links between specific viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Wild ducks excrete highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N8 (2014-2015) without clinical or pathological evidence of disease.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is essentially a poultry disease. Wild birds have traditionally not been involved in its spread, but the epidemiology of HPAI has changed in recent years. After its emergence in southeastern Asia in 1996, H5 HPAI virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage has evolved into several sub-lineages, some of which have spread over thousands of kilometers via long-distance migration of wild waterbirds. In order to determine whether the virus is adapting to wild waterbirds, we experimentally inoculated the HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A from 2014 into four key waterbird species-Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), common teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and common pochard (Aythya ferina)-and compared virus excretion and disease severity with historical data of the HPAI H5N1 virus infection from 2005 in the same four species. Our results showed that excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons for the 2014 virus, whereas excretion was highest in common pochards and mallards for the 2005 virus. The 2014 virus infection was subclinical in all four waterbird species, while the 2005 virus caused clinical disease and pathological changes in over 50% of the common pochards. In chickens, the 2014 virus infection caused systemic disease and high mortality, similar to the 2005 virus. In conclusion, the evidence was strongest for Eurasian wigeons as long-distance vectors for HPAI H5N8 virus from 2014. The implications of the switch in species-specific virus excretion and decreased disease severity may be that the HPAI H5 virus more easily spreads in the wild-waterbird population.

Title: Factors associated with influenza vaccination failure and severe disease in a French region in 2015.
Abstract: Current influenza vaccination strategy is based on limited analyses of circulating strains and has some drawbacks, as illustrated during the 2014-2015 season with the circulation of A(H3N2) viruses belonging to divergent genetic subgroups. We reasoned that these strains, poorly neutralized in vitro, may have been associated with vaccination failure and more severe diseases. We conducted a study on a continuous series of 249 confirmed influenza infections. Incidence was three fold greater than in the previous three years. Most isolates were A(H3N2) viruses (78%) and clustered in subgroups 3C.2a (57%) and 3C.3b (43%). We identified 23 non-synonymous mutations that had already been identified during previous seasons at low frequencies, except mutation Q197H, present in 26% of 3C.3b isolates. We identified lung disorder, tobacco smoking and A(H1N1)pdm09 infection as risk factor of severe influenza disease. In contrast, young age (< 5 years), A(H3N2) infection and initial admission to an emergency department were associated with a better outcome of influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study associates influenza vaccination failure and disease severity with circulating strains but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of H1N1 influenza virus-induced apoptosis by functionalized selenium nanoparticles with amantadine through ROS-mediated AKT signaling pathways.
Abstract: As a therapeutic antiviral agent, the clinical application of amantadine (AM) is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. To overcome the drug-resistant viruses and meet the growing demand of clinical diagnosis, the use of biological nanoparticles (NPs) has increased in order to develop novel anti-influenza drugs. The antiviral activity of selenium NPs with low toxicity and excellent activities has attracted increasing attention for biomedical intervention in recent years. In the present study, surface decoration of selenium NPs by AM (Se@AM) was designed to reverse drug resistance caused by influenza virus infection. Se@ AM with less toxicity remarkably inhibited the ability of H1N1 influenza to infect host cells through suppression of the neuraminidase activity. Moreover, Se@AM could prevent H1N1 from infecting Madin Darby Canine Kidney cell line and causing cell apoptosis supported by DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Furthermore, Se@AM obviously inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of phosphorylation of AKT. These results demonstrate that Se@AM is a potentially efficient antiviral pharmaceutical agent for H1N1 influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates antiviral activity of selenium nanoparticles with amantadine against H1N1 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Overexpression of a type III PKS gene affording novel violapyrones with enhanced anti-influenza A virus activity.
Abstract: Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are simple homodimer ketosynthases that distribute across plants, fungi, and bacteria, catalyzing formation of pyrone- and resorcinol-types aromatic polyketides with various bioactivities. The broad substrate promiscuity displayed by type III PKSs makes them wonderful candidates for expanding chemical diversity of polyketides. Violapyrone B (VLP B, 10), an α-pyrone compound produced by deepsea-derived Streptomyces somaliensis SCSIO ZH66, is encoded by a type III PKS VioA. We overexpressed VioA in three different hosts, including Streptomyces coelicolor M1146, Streptomyces sanyensis FMA as well as the native producer S. somaliensis SCSIO ZH66, leading to accumulation of different violapyrone compounds. Among them, S. coelicolor M1146 served as the host producing the most abundant violapyrones, from which five new (2-4, 7 and 12) and nine known (1, 5, 6, 8-11, 13 and 14) compounds were identified. Anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus activity of these compounds was then evaluated using ribavirin as a positive control (IC<sub>50</sub> = 112.9 μM), revealing that compounds 11-14 showed considerable activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 112.7, 26.9, 106.7 and 28.8 μM, respectively, which are significantly improved as compared to that of VLP B (10) (IC<sub>50</sub> > 200 μM). The productions of 10 and 13 were increased by adding P450 inhibitor metyrapone. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis experiment led to demonstration of the residue S242 to be essential for the activity of VioA. Biological background of the expression hosts is an important factor impacting on the encoding products of type III PKSs. By using S. coelicolor M1146 as cell factory, we were able to generate fourteen VLPs compounds. Anti-H1N1 activity assay suggested that the lipophilic nature of the alkyl chains of VLPs plays an important role for the activity, providing valuable guidance for further structural optimization of VLPs.

Title: H3N2 influenza viruses in humans: Viral mechanisms, evolution, and evaluation.
Abstract: Annual seasonal influenza vaccines are composed of two influenza A strains representing the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, and two influenza B strains representing the Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Strains from these Influenza A and Influenza B viruses currently co-circulate in humans. Of these, strains associated with the H3N2 subtype are affiliated with severe influenza seasons. H3N2 influenza viruses pre-dominated during 3 of the last 5 quite severe influenza seasons. During the 2016/2017 flu season, the H3N2 component of the influenza vaccine exhibited a poor protective efficacy (∼28-42%) against preventing infection of co-circulating strains. Since their introduction to the human population in 1968, H3N2 Influenza viruses have rapidly evolved both genetically and antigenically in an attempt to escape host immune pressures. As a result, these viruses have added numerous N-linked glycans to the viral hemagglutinin (HA), increased the overall net charge of the HA molecule, changed their preferences in receptor binding, and altered the ability of neuraminidase (NA) to agglutinate red blood cells prior to host entry. Over time, these adaptations have made characterizing these viruses increasingly difficult. This review investigates these recent changes in modern H3N2 influenza viruses and explores the methods that researchers are currently developing in order to study these viruses.

Reason: This is a review discussing viral mechanisms and evolution of H3N2 influenza viruses without explicit experimental links between genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Two genetically diverse H7N7 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in central China.
Abstract: After the emergence of H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIV) in early 2013 in China, active surveillance of AIVs in migratory birds was undertaken, and two H7N7 strains were subsequently recovered from the fresh droppings of migratory birds; the strains were from different hosts and sampling sites. Phylogenetic and sequence similarity network analyses indicated that several genes of the two H7N7 viruses were closely related to those in AIVs circulating in domestic poultry, although different gene segments were implicated in the two isolates. This strongly suggested that genes from viruses infecting migratory birds have been introduced into poultry-infecting strains. A Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of all eight segments implied that multiple reassortments have occurred in the evolution of these viruses, particularly during late 2011 and early 2014. Antigenic analysis using a hemagglutination inhibition test showed that the two H7N7 viruses were moderately cross-reactive with H7N9-specific anti-serum. The ability of the two H7N7 viruses to remain infectious under various pH and temperature conditions was evaluated, and the viruses persisted the longest at near-neutral pH and in cold temperatures. Animal infection experiments showed that the viruses were avirulent to mice and could not be recovered from any organs. Our results indicate that low pathogenic, divergent H7N7 viruses circulate within the East Asian-Australasian flyway. Virus dispersal between migratory birds and domestic poultry may increase the risk of the emergence of novel unprecedented strains.

Title: Influenza A virus recovery, diversity, and intercontinental exchange: A multi-year assessment of wild bird sampling at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska.
Abstract: Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011-2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), emperor geese (Chen canagica) and glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (Anas acuta), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.

Title: Wild birds in Chile Harbor diverse avian influenza A viruses.
Abstract: While the circulation of avian influenza viruses (IAV) in wild birds in the northern hemisphere has been well documented, data from South America remain sparse. To address this gap in knowledge, we undertook IAV surveillance in wild birds in parts of Central and Northern Chile between 2012 and 2015. A wide diversity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were identified and 16 viruses were isolated including low pathogenic H5 and H7 strains, making this the largest and most diverse collection of Chilean avian IAVs to date. Unlike IAVs isolated from wild birds in other South American countries where the genes were most like viruses isolated from wild birds in either North America or South America, the Chilean viruses were reassortants containing genes like viruses isolated from both continents. In summary, our studies demonstrate that genetically diverse avian IAVs are circulating in wild birds in Chile highlighting the need for further investigation in this understudied area of the world.

Title: Dynamic analysis of expression of chemokine and cytokine gene responses to H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses in DF-1 cells.
Abstract: H5N1 and H9N2 are the most important causes of avian influenza in China. Chemokines and cytokines play important roles in inflammatory response that clearly differ between H5N1 and H9N2 infection. To investigate whether chemokines and cytokines are differentially regulated following H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs infection, dynamic expression of chemokines and cytokines, including IL8L1, IL8L2, CX3CL1, CCL5, CCL20, K203, SCYA4, XLC1, CCLi10, CCL19, IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in DF-1 cells. It was found that IL8L1, IL8L2, CX3CL1, CCL5, CCL20, K203, SCYA4, IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α increased significantly after induction of H5N1 or H9N2 AIV infection, whereas no expression of XCL1, CCLi10 or CCL19 was detected. H9N2 AIV infection was associated with much stronger chemokine responses than infection with H5N1, whereas the cytokines showed opposite results. It was found that K203 is a constant chemotactic factor independent of subtype of AIVs and infectious dose, CCL20 and IL-1β are constant regardless of the infectious dose but depend on the subtype of AIV, chemotactic factors IL8L1, IL8L2 and CCL5 are dependent both on subtype of AIVs and infectious dose, and K203, CX3CL1, SCYA4, CCL20, IFN-α, IL-1β and TNF-α are specific to responses to H5N1 AIV infection whereas K203, CCL20, IFN-β, IL-1β and IL-6 are specific to H9N2 infection. These results provide basic data for explaining differences in inflammation and phenotypes of histopathological changes caused by H5N1 and H9N2 and add new information on the roles of chemokines and cytokines in virulence of AIVs.

Title: High dimensional random walks can appear low dimensional: Application to influenza H3N2 evolution.
Abstract: One important feature of the mammalian immune system is the highly specific binding of antigens to antibodies. Antibodies generated in response to one infection may also provide some level of cross immunity to other infections. One model to describe this cross immunity is the notion of antigenic space, which assigns each antibody and each virus a point in R<sup>n</sup>. Past studies using hemagglutination data have suggested the dimensionality of antigenic space, n, is low. We propose that influenza evolution may be modeled as a Gaussian random walk. We then show that hemagluttination data would be consistent with a walk in very high dimensions. The discrepancy between our result and prior studies is due to the fact that random walks can appear low dimensional according to a variety of analyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS). A high dimensionality of antigenic space is of importance to modelers, as it suggests a smaller role for pre-existing immunity within the host population.
Relevant: False

Title: Activation and Induction of Antigen-Specific T Follicular Helper Cells Play a Critical Role in Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine-Induced Human Mucosal Anti-influenza Antibody Response.
Abstract: There is increasing interest recently in developing intranasal vaccines against respiratory tract infections. The antibody response is critical for vaccine-induced protection, and T follicular helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>) are considered important for mediating the antibody response. Most data supporting the role for T<sub>FH</sub> in the antibody response are from animal studies, and direct evidence from humans is limited, apart from the presence of T<sub>FH</sub>-like cells in blood. We studied the activation and induction of T<sub>FH</sub> and their role in the anti-influenza antibody response induced by a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in human nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). T<sub>FH</sub> activation in adenotonsillar tissues was analyzed by flow cytometry, and anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibodies were examined following LAIV stimulation of tonsillar mononuclear cells (MNC). Induction of antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> by LAIV was studied by flow cytometry analysis of induced T<sub>FH</sub> and CD154 expression. LAIV induced T<sub>FH</sub> proliferation, which correlated with anti-HA antibody production, and T<sub>FH</sub> were shown to be critical for the antibody response. Induction of T<sub>FH</sub> from naive T cells by LAIV was shown in newly induced T<sub>FH</sub> expressing BCL6 and CD21, followed by the detection of anti-HA antibodies. Antigen specificity of LAIV-induced T<sub>FH</sub> was demonstrated by expression of the antigen-specific T cell activation marker CD154 upon challenge by H1N1 virus antigen or HA. LAIV-induced T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation was inhibited by BCL6, interleukin-21 (IL-21), ICOS, and CD40 signaling blocking, and that diminished anti-HA antibody production. In conclusion, we demonstrated the induction by LAIV of antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> in human NALT that provide critical support for the anti-influenza antibody response. Promoting antigen-specific T<sub>FH</sub> in NALT by use of intranasal vaccines may provide an effective vaccination strategy against respiratory infections in humans.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Airway infections, such as influenza, are common in humans. Intranasal vaccination has been considered a biologically relevant and effective way of immunization against airway infection. The vaccine-induced antibody response is crucial for protection against infection. Recent data from animal studies suggest that one type of T cells, T<sub>FH</sub>, are important for the antibody response. However, data on whether T<sub>FH</sub>-mediated help for antibody production operates in humans are limited due to the lack of access to human immune tissue containing T<sub>FH</sub> In this study, we demonstrate the induction of T<sub>FH</sub> in human immune tissue, providing critical support for the anti-influenza antibody response, by use of an intranasal influenza vaccine. Our findings provide direct evidence that T<sub>FH</sub> play a critical role in vaccine-induced immunity in humans and suggest a novel strategy for promoting such cells by use of intranasal vaccines against respiratory infections.

Title: Exploring Ugi-Azide Four-Component Reaction Products for Broad-Spectrum Influenza Antivirals with a High Genetic Barrier to Drug Resistance.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens that are responsible for seasonal influenza and sporadic influenza pandemic. The therapeutic efficacy of current influenza vaccines and small molecule antiviral drugs is limited due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses. In response to the urgent need for the next generation of influenza antivirals, we utilized a fast-track drug discovery platform by exploring multi-component reaction products for antiviral drug candidates. Specifically, molecular docking was applied to screen a small molecule library derived from the Ugi-azide four-component reaction methodology for inhibitors that target the influenza polymerase PA<sub>C</sub>-PB1<sub>N</sub> interactions. One hit compound 5 was confirmed to inhibit PA<sub>C</sub>-PB1<sub>N</sub> interactions in an ELISA assay and had potent antiviral activity in an antiviral plaque assay. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of compound 12a, which had broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a higher in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance than oseltamivir. Overall, the discovery of compound 12a as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral with a high in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance is significant, as it offers a second line of defense to combat the next influenza epidemics and pandemics if vaccines and oseltamivir fail to confine the disease outbreak.

Title: Sequential Immunizations with heterosubtypic virus-like particles elicit cross protection against divergent influenza A viruses in mice.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza vaccines have proven to be effective against well-matched viruses in healthy adults. However, rapid accumulation of mutations in the main antigenic surface proteins of influenza can compromise the efficiency of flu vaccines. Occasionally, influenza pandemics arise and present a different type of challenge to current seasonal vaccines. Novel vaccination strategies that can educate the host immune system to generate immune responses focusing on conserved epitopes on theses antigenic surface proteins are crucial for controlling and limiting influenza epidemics and pandemics. In this study, we have sequentially vaccinated mice with heterosubtypic influenza HA virus-like particles (VLPs) harboring H1, H8, and H13 from the HA phylogenetic group 1, or H3, H4, and H10 from the HA phylogenetic group 2, or in various combinations. The immunized animals were fully protected when challenged with lethal doses of heterosubtypic viruses from either phylogenetic group. Our vaccination approach demonstrates a promising strategy for the development of a 'universal influenza vaccine'.

Title: Influence of Novel Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection on Migrating Whooper Swans Fecal Microbiota.
Abstract: The migration of wild birds plays an important role in the transmission and spread of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, posing a severe risk to animal and human health. Substantial evidence suggests that altered gut microbial community is implicated in the infection of respiratory influenza virus. However, the influence of H5N1 infection in gut microbiota of migratory birds remains unknown. In January 2015, a novel recombinant H5N1 virus emerged and killed about 100 migratory birds, mainly including whooper swans in Sanmenxia Reservoir Area of China. Here, we describe the first fecal microbiome diversity study of H5N1-infected migratory birds. By investigating the influence of H5N1 infection on fecal bacterial communities in infected and uninfected individuals, we found that H5N1 infection shaped the gut microbiota composition by a difference in the dominance of some genera, such as <i>Aeromonas</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>. We also found a decreased α diversity and increased β diversity in infectious individuals. Our results highlight that increases in changes in pathogen-containing gut communities occur when individuals become infected with H5N1. Our study may provide the first evidence that there are statistical association among H5N1 presence and fecal microbiota compositional shifts, and properties of the fecal microbiota may serve as the risk of gut-linked disease in migrates with H5N1 and further aggravate the disease transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines the impact of H5N1 infection on gut microbiota composition in migratory birds without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Use of Genome Sequencing to Define Institutional Influenza Outbreaks, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2014-15.
Abstract: Adequacy of the current clinical definition of institutional influenza outbreaks is unclear. We performed a retrospective genome sequencing and epidemiologic analysis of institutional influenza outbreaks that occurred during the 2014-15 influenza season in Toronto, Canada. We sequenced the 2 earliest submitted samples positive for influenza A(H3N2) from each of 38 reported institutional outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Genome sequencing showed most outbreak pairs identified by using the current clinical definition were highly related. Inclusion of surveillance samples demonstrated that outbreak sources were likely introductions from broader circulating lineages. Pairwise distance analysis using majority genome and hemagglutinin-specific genes enabled identification of thresholds for discrimination of within and between outbreak pairs; the area under the curve ranged 0.93-0.95. Routine genome sequencing for defining influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities is unlikely to add significantly to the current clinical definition. Sequencing may prove most useful for investigating sources of outbreak introductions.

Abstract: Duck-targeted vaccines to protect against avian influenza are critically needed to aid in influenza disease control efforts in regions where ducks are endemic for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a promising candidate viral vector for development of vaccines targeting ducks, owing to its large genome and narrow host range. The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is a versatile gene-editing tool that has proven beneficial for gene modification and construction of recombinant DNA viral vectored vaccines. Currently, there are two commonly used methods for gene insertion: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Owing to its advantages in efficiency and independence from molecular requirements of the homologous arms, we utilized NHEJ-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen expression cassette into the DEV genome. The insert was initially tagged with reporter green fluorescence protein (GFP), and a Cre-Lox system was later used to remove the <i>GFP</i> gene insert. Furthermore, a universal donor plasmid system was established by introducing double bait sequences that were independent of the viral genome. In summary, we provide proof of principle for generating recombinant DEV viral vectored vaccines against the influenza virus using an integrated NHEJ-CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-Lox system.

Reason: The paper describes gene editing methods to generate recombinant vaccines but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Swarm incursions of reassortants of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains H5N8 and H5N5, clade 2.3.4.4b, Germany, winter 2016/17.
Abstract: The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5Nx viruses in winter 2016/2017 was the most severe HPAI epizootic ever reported in Germany. The H5N8 and H5N5 viruses detected in birds in Germany in 2016/2017 represent a reassortant swarm of at least five distinct genotypes, which carried closely related HA segments derived from clade 2.3.4.4b. The genotypes of these viruses and their spatio-temporal distribution indicated a unique situation with multiple independent entries of HPAIV into Germany.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genotypic characterization of reassortant H5Nx viruses and their spatio-temporal distribution but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Disordered oropharyngeal microbial communities in H7N9 patients with or without secondary bacterial lung infection.
Abstract: Secondary bacterial lung infection (SBLI) is a serious complication in patients with H7N9 virus infection, and increases disease severity. The oropharyngeal (OP) microbiome helps prevent colonisation of respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the OP microbiome of H7N9 patients with/without secondary bacterial pneumonia using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. OP swab samples were collected from 51 H7N9 patients (21 with SBLI and 30 without) and 30 matched healthy controls (HCs) and used for comparative composition, diversity and richness analyses of microbial communities. Principal coordinates analysis successfully distinguished between the OP microbiomes of H7N9 patients and healthy subjects, and the OP microbiome diversity of patients with SBLI was significantly increased. There was significant dysbiosis of the OP microbiome in H7N9 patients, with an abundance of Leptotrichia, Oribacterium, Streptococcus, Atopobium, Eubacterium, Solobacterium and Rothia species in patients with SBLI, and Filifactor, Megasphaera and Leptotrichia species in patients without SBLI, when compared with HCs. Importantly, Haemophilus and Bacteroides species were enriched in HCs. These findings revealed dysbiosis of the OP microbiota in H7N9 patients, and identified OP microbial risk indicators of SBLI, suggesting that the OP microbiome could provide novel and non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for early microbiota-targeted prophylactic therapies for SBLI prevention.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes oropharyngeal microbiome changes in H7N9 patients but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity - United States, October 1-November 25, 2017.
Abstract: Influenza activity in the United States was low during October 2017, but has been increasing since the beginning of November. Influenza A viruses have been most commonly identified, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Several influenza activity indicators were higher than is typically seen for this time of year. The majority of influenza viruses characterized during this period were genetically or antigenically similar to the 2017-18 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine reference viruses. These data indicate that currently circulating viruses have not undergone significant antigenic drift; however, circulating A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically less similar to egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses used for producing the majority of influenza vaccines in the United States. It is difficult to predict which influenza viruses will predominate in the 2017-18 influenza season; however, in recent past seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, hospitalizations and deaths were more common, and the effectiveness of the vaccine was lower. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Multiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended for use during the 2017-18 season, and vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 1-November 25, 2017 (surveillance weeks 40-47).<sup>†</sup>.

Title: Characterization of Influenza Virus Pseudotyped with Ebolavirus Glycoprotein.
Abstract: We have produced a new Ebola virus pseudotype, E-S-FLU, that can be handled in biosafety level 1/2 containment for laboratory analysis. The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC<sup>1280</sup>; Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Ebola virus is in the <i>Filoviridae</i> family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.

Title: Genetic evolution of influenza H9N2 viruses isolated from various hosts in China from 1994 to 2013.
Abstract: Influenza H9N2 subtype viruses and their reassortants (such as H7N9) are posing increasing threats to birds and humans in China. During 2009-2013, multiple novel subtype viruses with H9N2 original genes emerged in China. Yet, the genetic evolution of H9N2 viruses in various host organisms in China has not been systematically investigated since 2009. In the present study, we performed large-scale sequence analysis of H9N2 viral genomes from public databases, representing the spectrum of viruses isolated from birds, mammals and humans in China from 1994 to 2013, and updated the clade classification for each segment. We identified 117 distinct genotypes in 730 H9N2 viruses. We analyzed the sequences of all eight segments in each virus and found three important time points: the years 2000, 2006 and 2010. In the periods divided by these years, genotypic diversity, geographic distribution and host range changed considerably. Genotypic diversity fluctuated greatly in 2000 and 2006. Since 2010, a single genotype became predominant in poultry throughout China, and the eastern coastal region became the newly identified epidemic center. Throughout their 20-year prevalence in China, H9N2 influenza viruses have emerged and adapted from aquatic birds to chickens. The minor avian species and wild birds exacerbated H9N2 genotypes by providing diversified genes, and chickens were the most prevalent vector in which the viruses evolved and expanded their prevalence. It is the necessity for surveillance and disease control on live-bird markets, poultry farms and wild-bird habitats in China.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic evolution and genotypic diversity of H9N2 viruses over time and hosts but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: A brief summary of the epidemiology and genetic relatedness of avian influenza H9N2 virus in birds and mammals in the Middle East and North Africa.
Abstract: H9N2 is the most widespread avian influenza virus subtype in poultry worldwide. It infects a broad spectrum of host species including birds and mammals. Infections in poultry and humans vary from silent to fatal. Importantly, all AIV, which are fatal in humans (e.g. H5N1, H7N9) acquired their 'internal' gene segments from H9N2 viruses. Although H9N2 is endemic in the Middle East (ME) and North Africa since the late 1990s, little is known about its epidemiology and genetics on a regional level. In this review, we summarised the epidemiological situation of H9N2 in poultry and mammals in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. The virus has been isolated from humans in Egypt and serosurveys indicated widespread infection particularly among poultry workers and pigs in some countries. Some isolates replicated well in experimentally inoculated dogs, mice, hamsters and ferrets. Insufficient protection of immunised poultry was frequently reported most likely due to concurrent viral or bacterial infections and antigenic drift of the field viruses from outdated vaccine strains. Genetic analysis indicated several distinct phylogroups including a panzootic genotype in the Asian and African parts of the ME, which may be useful for the development of vaccines. The extensive circulation of H9N2 for about 20 years in this region where the H5N1 virus is also endemic in some countries, poses a serious public health threat. Regional surveillance and control strategy are highly recommended.

Title: Molecular epidemiology of swine influenza A viruses in the Southeastern United States, highlights regional differences in circulating strains.
Abstract: Swine influenza A virus (IAV) can cause widespread respiratory disease with high morbidity, low mortality, and have a substantial economic impact to the swine industry. Swine infection may contribute to pandemic IAV given their susceptibility to both avian and human IAVs. Currently, three IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2) circulate in swine in North America frequently combining gene segments from avian or human viruses. This study investigated the prevalence of IAV in commercial swine herds. A total of 1878 oral fluid samples were collected from pigs of all ages from 201 commercial farms located in North Carolina and South Carolina. Sixty-eight oral fluid samples from 35 farms were positive by MP gene PCR with an overall IAV-positivity of 3.6%. On the herd level, the percentage of IAV positivity was 17.4%. Fifty-six viruses were subtyped, while 12 were partly subtyped or not subtyped at all. Using de novo assembly, complete sequences were obtained for 59 HA genes. The majority of IAVs subtyped had an H1 HA demonstrating a considerable prevalence over H3 viruses. Furthermore, only six out of eleven HA types were detected which has implications for the selection of vaccines used by swine producers in the region.

Title: Spatio-temporal pattern analysis for evaluation of the spread of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, 2013-2014.
Abstract: A large number (n = 460) of A(H7N9) human infections have been reported in China from March 2013 through December 2014, and H7N9 outbreaks in humans became an emerging issue for China health, which have caused numerous disease outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild bird populations, and threatened human health severely. The aims of this study were to investigate the directional trend of the epidemic and to identify the significant presence of spatial-temporal clustering of influenza A(H7N9) human cases between March 2013 and December 2014. Three distinct epidemic phases of A(H7N9) human infections were identified in this study. In each phase, standard deviational ellipse analysis was conducted to examine the directional trend of disease spreading, and retrospective space-time permutation scan statistic was then used to identify the spatio-temporal cluster patterns of H7N9 outbreaks in humans. The ever-changing location and the increasing size of the three identified standard deviational ellipses showed that the epidemic moved from east to southeast coast, and hence to some central regions, with a future epidemiological trend of continue dispersing to more central regions of China, and a few new human cases might also appear in parts of the western China. Furthermore, A(H7N9) human infections were clustering in space and time in the first two phases with five significant spatio-temporal clusters (p < 0.05), but there was no significant cluster identified in phase III. There was a new epidemiologic pattern that the decrease in significant spatio-temporal cluster of A(H7N9) human infections was accompanied with an obvious spatial expansion of the outbreaks during the study period, and identification of the spatio-temporal patterns of the epidemic can provide valuable insights for better understanding the spreading dynamics of the disease in China.

Title: The Lethal Spanish Influenza Pandemic in Poland.
Abstract: The Spanish influenza pandemic in the years 1918-1920 was the largest and most tragic pandemic of infectious disease in human history. Deciphering the structure of the virus (including the determination of complete genome sequence) of this pandemic and the phylogenetic analysis and explanation of its virulence became possible thanks to molecular genetic analysis of the virus isolated from the fixed and frozen lung tissue of influenza victims who died in 1918 and were buried frozen in Alaska and Spitsbergen. Epidemiological data from the course of this pandemic in Poland have not been previously published. For analysis, we used source materials such as clinical studies and case reports of doctors fighting against the pandemic and registries of influenza cases in units of the Polish Army and military hospitals. Clinically, the pandemic of 1918 was characterized by the same symptoms and course as influenza in other years. Pathologically, the disease was similar to the other pandemic, in that the destruction was mostly limited to the respiratory tract. The "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 took place in Poland in 3 epidemic waves. The peaks of morbidity and mortality occurred in the capital, Warsaw, in December 1918 and in December 1919 to January 1920. It is estimated that throughout the pandemic period of 1918-1920 in Poland, 200 000 to 300 000 people died.

Title: Structural basis for clonal diversity of the human T-cell response to a dominant influenza virus epitope.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) causes an acute infection in humans that is normally eliminated by CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Individuals expressing the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2 produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes bearing T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the immunodominant IAV epitope GILGFVFTL (GIL). Most GIL-specific TCRs utilize α/β chain pairs encoded by the TRAV27/TRBV19 gene combination to recognize this relatively featureless peptide epitope (canonical TCRs). However, ∼40% of GIL-specific TCRs express a wide variety of other TRAV/TRBV combinations (non-canonical TCRs). To investigate the structural underpinnings of this remarkable diversity, we determined the crystal structure of a non-canonical GIL-specific TCR (F50) expressing the TRAV13-1/TRBV27 gene combination bound to GIL-HLA-A2 to 1.7 Å resolution. Comparison of the F50-GIL-HLA-A2 complex with the previously published complex formed by a canonical TCR (JM22) revealed that F50 and JM22 engage GIL-HLA-A2 in markedly different orientations. These orientations are distinguished by crossing angles of TCR to peptide-MHC of 29° for F50 <i>versus</i> 69° for JM22 and by a focus by F50 on the C terminus rather than the center of the MHC α1 helix for JM22. In addition, F50, unlike JM22, uses a tryptophan instead of an arginine to fill a critical notch between GIL and the HLA-A2 α2 helix. The F50-GIL-HLA-A2 complex shows that there are multiple structurally distinct solutions to recognizing an identical peptide-MHC ligand with sufficient affinity to elicit a broad anti-IAV response that protects against viral escape and T-cell clonal loss.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on structural analysis of T-cell receptor diversity recognizing an influenza epitope, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Molecular evolution of hemagglutinin gene of Influenza A virus.
Abstract: In the history of human civilization, influenza is the second most catastrophic killer disease for mankind with plague ranking first in the medieval times. The 1918-1919 'Spanish flu' killed 20-50 million people worldwide. According to a report from WHO, there have been four pandemics, several epidemics and recurrent seasonal outbreaks of influenza in different parts of the world. The virus is a potential bioterrorism threat with biological 'Chernobyl-like disaster' that occurred in Soviet Russia in 1977. Here, the author reviews the biology of the surface exposed hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, a gene under constant positive selection pressure to evade host immunity and vaccination. Global, local and seasonal outbreaks of influenza lead to a significant number of deaths both in humans and poultry birds.

Title: Viral outbreaks involve destabilized evolutionary networks: evidence from Ebola, Influenza and Zika.
Abstract: Recent history has provided us with one pandemic (Influenza A/H1N1) and two severe viral outbreaks (Ebola and Zika). In all three cases, post-hoc analyses have given us deep insights into what triggered these outbreaks, their timing, evolutionary dynamics, and phylogeography, but the genomic characteristics of outbreak viruses are still unclear. To address this outstanding question, we searched for a common denominator between these recent outbreaks, positing that the genome of outbreak viruses is in an unstable evolutionary state, while that of non-outbreak viruses is stabilized by a network of correlated substitutions. Here, we show that during regular epidemics, viral genomes are indeed stabilized by a dense network of weakly correlated sites, and that these networks disappear during pandemics and outbreaks when rates of evolution increase transiently. Post-pandemic, these evolutionary networks are progressively re-established. We finally show that destabilization is not caused by substitutions targeting epitopes, but more likely by changes in the environment sensu lato. Our results prompt for a new interpretation of pandemics as being associated with evolutionary destabilized viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes evolutionary network stability during viral outbreaks but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza annual report, 2015.
Abstract: As part of its role in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne received a total of 5,557 influenza positive samples during 2015. Viruses were analysed for their antigenic, genetic and antiviral susceptibility properties. In 2015, influenza B viruses predominated over influenza A(H1)pdm09 and A(H3) viruses, accounting for a total of 58% of all viruses analysed. The vast majority of A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and influenza B viruses analysed at the Centre were found to be antigenically similar to the respective WHO recommended vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2015. However, phylogenetic analysis of a selection of viruses indicated that the majority of circulating A(H3) viruses were genetically distinct from the WHO recommended strain for 2015, resulting in an update to the recommended vaccine strain for the Southern Hemisphere for 2016. With an increasing predominance of B/Victoria lineage viruses over B/Yamagata lineage viruses through the course of 2015, WHO also updated the recommended influenza B strain in the trivalent influenza vaccine for 2016. Of more than 3,300 samples tested for resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, only 1 A(H1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. The Centre undertook primary isolation of candidate vaccine viruses directly into eggs, and in 2015 a total of 45 viruses were successfully isolated in eggs.

Title: Chemical Genomics Approach Leads to the Identification of Hesperadin, an Aurora B Kinase Inhibitor, as a Broad-Spectrum Influenza Antiviral.
Abstract: Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens that are responsible for annual influenza epidemics and sporadic influenza pandemics. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu<sup>®</sup>) is currently the only FDA-approved oral drug that is available for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. However, its narrow therapeutic window, coupled with the increasing incidence of drug resistance, calls for the next generation of influenza antivirals. In this study, we discovered hesperadin, an aurora B kinase inhibitor, as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral through forward chemical genomics screening. Hesperadin inhibits multiple human clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses with single to submicromolar efficacy, including oseltamivir-resistant strains. Mechanistic studies revealed that hesperadin inhibits the early stage of viral replication by delaying the nuclear entry of viral ribonucleoprotein complex, thereby inhibiting viral RNA transcription and translation as well as viral protein synthesis. Moreover, a combination of hesperadin with oseltamivir shows synergistic antiviral activity, therefore hesperadin can be used either alone to treat infections by oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses or used in combination with oseltamivir to delay resistance evolution among oseltamivir-sensitive strains. In summary, the discovery of hesperadin as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral offers an alternative to combat future influenza epidemics and pandemics.

Title: HVEM Imprints Memory Potential on Effector CD8 T Cells Required for Protective Mucosal Immunity.
Abstract: Mucosal immunity to reinfection with a highly virulent virus requires the accumulation and persistence of memory CD8 T cells at the site of primary infection. These cells may derive from memory precursor effector cells (MPECs), which are distinct from short-lived effector cells that provide acute protection but are often destined to die. Using respiratory virus infection, we show that herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM; TNFRSF14), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, provides key signals for MPEC persistence. HVEM-deficient CD8 T cells expanded normally but were skewed away from MPECs with resultant poor development of circulating and lung-resident memory cells. HVEM was selectively expressed on MPECs whereas MPECs deficient in HVEM failed to survive in adoptive transfer recipients. As a consequence, HVEM-deficient recipients failed to afford protection against respiratory reinfection with influenza virus. HVEM therefore represents a critical signal for MPECs and development of protective mucosal CD8 T cell memory.
Relevant: False

Title: Spread of Canine Influenza A(H3N2) Virus, United States.
Abstract: A canine influenza A(H3N2) virus emerged in the United States in February-March 2015, causing respiratory disease in dogs. The virus had previously been circulating among dogs in Asia, where it originated through the transfer of an avian-origin influenza virus around 2005 and continues to circulate. Sequence analysis suggests the US outbreak was initiated by a single introduction, in Chicago, of an H3N2 canine influenza virus circulating among dogs in South Korea in 2015. Despite local control measures, the virus has continued circulating among dogs in and around Chicago and has spread to several other areas of the country, particularly Georgia and North Carolina, although these secondary outbreaks appear to have ended within a few months. Some genetic variation has accumulated among the US viruses, with the appearance of regional-temporal lineages. The potential for interspecies transmission and zoonotic events involving this newly emerged influenza A virus is currently unknown.

Title: Phylogenetic characterisation of circulating, clinical influenza isolates from Bali, Indonesia: preliminary report from the BaliMEI project.
Abstract: Human influenza represents a major public health concern, especially in south-east Asia where the risk of emergence and spread of novel influenza viruses is particularly high. The BaliMEI study aims to conduct a five year active surveillance and characterisation of influenza viruses in Bali using an extensive network of participating healthcare facilities. Samples were collected during routine diagnostic treatment in healthcare facilities. In addition to standard clinical and molecular methods for influenza typing, next generation sequencing and subsequent de novo genome assembly were performed to investigate the phylogeny of the collected patient samples. The samples collected are characteristic of the seasonally circulating influenza viruses with indications of phylogenetic links to other samples characterised in neighbouring countries during the same time period. There were some strong phylogenetic links with sequences from samples collected in geographically proximal regions, with some of the samples from the same time-period resulting to small clusters at the tree-end points. However this work, which is the first of its kind completely performed within Indonesia, supports the view that the circulating seasonal influenza in Bali reflects the strains circulating in geographically neighbouring areas as would be expected to occur within a busy regional transit centre.

Title: A CRISPR Activation Screen Identifies a Pan-avian Influenza Virus Inhibitory Host Factor.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a pathogen that poses significant risks to human health. It is therefore critical to develop strategies to prevent influenza disease. Many loss-of-function screens have been performed to identify the host proteins required for viral infection. However, there has been no systematic screen to identify the host factors that, when overexpressed, are sufficient to prevent infection. In this study, we used CRISPR/dCas9 activation technology to perform a genome-wide overexpression screen to identify IAV restriction factors. The major hit from our screen, B4GALNT2, showed inhibitory activity against influenza viruses with an α2,3-linked sialic acid receptor preference. B4GALNT2 overexpression prevented the infection of every avian influenza virus strain tested, including the H5, H9, and H7 subtypes, which have previously caused disease in humans. Thus, we have used CRISPR/dCas9 activation technology to identify a factor that can abolish infection by avian influenza viruses.

Title: Evolution of Influenza A Virus by Mutation and Re-Assortment.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV), a highly infectious respiratory pathogen, has continued to be a significant threat to global public health. To complete their life cycle, influenza viruses have evolved multiple strategies to interact with a host. A large number of studies have revealed that the evolution of influenza A virus is mainly mediated through the mutation of the virus itself and the re-assortment of viral genomes derived from various strains. The evolution of influenza A virus through these mechanisms causes worldwide annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. Importantly, influenza A virus can evolve from an animal infected pathogen to a human infected pathogen. The highly pathogenic influenza virus has resulted in stupendous economic losses due to its morbidity and mortality both in human and animals. Influenza viruses fall into a category of viruses that can cause zoonotic infection with stable adaptation to human, leading to sustained horizontal transmission. The rapid mutations of influenza A virus result in the loss of vaccine optimal efficacy, and challenge the complete eradication of the virus. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of influenza A virus evolution caused by the mutation and re-assortment of viral genomes. In addition, we discuss the specific mechanisms by which the virus evolves.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review article discussing mechanisms of influenza virus evolution without presenting explicit new genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Predominance of influenza A(H3N2) virus genetic subclade 3C.2a1 during an early 2016/17 influenza season in Europe - Contribution of surveillance data from World Health Organization (WHO) European Region to the WHO vaccine composition consultation for northern hemisphere 2017/18.
Abstract: During the European 2016/17 influenza season, A(H3N2) viruses have predominated and the majority clustered in genetic subclade 3C.2a1. Genetic analyses showed that circulating viruses have undergone considerable genetic diversification of the haemagglutinin gene from the current vaccine virus A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (clade 3C.2a), but the antigenic data that is limited by the challenges with the antigenic characterisation of currently circulating A(H3N2) viruses, showed no clear evidence of antigenic change. The recommended A(H3N2) vaccine component for the northern hemisphere 2017/18 influenza season remained unchanged. However, early and mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates were suggestive of reduced VE against A(H3N2) viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Avian influenza H9N2 virus isolated from air samples in LPMs in Jiangxi, China.
Abstract: Recently, avian influenza virus has caused repeated worldwide outbreaks in humans. Live Poultry Markets (LPMs) play an important role in the circulation and reassortment of novel Avian Influenza Virus (AIVs). Aerosol transmission is one of the most important pathways for influenza virus to spread among poultry, from poultry to mammals, and among mammals. In this study, air samples were collected from LPMs in Nanchang city between April 2014 and March 2015 to investigate possible aerosol transmission of AIVs. Air samples were detected for Flu A by Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RRT-PCR). If samples were positive for Flu A, they were inoculated into 9- to 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs. If the result was positive, the whole genome of the virus was sequenced by MiSeq. Phylogenetic trees of all 8 segments were constructed using MEGA 6.05 software. To investigate the possible aerosol transmission of AIVs, 807 air samples were collected from LPMs in Nanchang city between April 2014 and March 2015. Based on RRT-PCR results, 275 samples (34.1%) were Flu A positive, and one virus was successfully isolated with embryonated eggs. The virus shared high nucleotide homology with H9N2 AIVs from South China. Our study provides further evidence that the air in LPMs can be contaminated by influenza viruses and their nucleic acids, and this should be considered when choosing and evaluating disinfection strategies in LPMs, such as regular air disinfection. Aerosolized viruses such as the H9N2 virus detected in this study can increase the risk of human infection when people are exposed in LPMs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on detection and genetic characterization of H9N2 virus isolated from air samples but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Feral Swine in the United States Have Been Exposed to both Avian and Swine Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine can cause sporadic infections and pandemic outbreaks among humans, but how avian IAV emerges in swine is still unclear. Unlike domestic swine, feral swine are free ranging and have many opportunities for IAV exposure through contacts with various habitats and animals, including migratory waterfowl, a natural reservoir for IAVs. During the period from 2010 to 2013, 8,239 serum samples were collected from feral swine across 35 U.S. states and tested against 45 contemporary antigenic variants of avian, swine, and human IAVs; of these, 406 (4.9%) samples were IAV antibody positive. Among 294 serum samples selected for antigenic characterization, 271 cross-reacted with ≥1 tested virus, whereas the other 23 did not cross-react with any tested virus. Of the 271 IAV-positive samples, 236 cross-reacted with swine IAVs, 1 with avian IAVs, and 16 with avian and swine IAVs, indicating that feral swine had been exposed to both swine and avian IAVs but predominantly to swine IAVs. Our findings suggest that feral swine could potentially be infected with both avian and swine IAVs, generating novel IAVs by hosting and reassorting IAVs from wild birds and domestic swine and facilitating adaptation of avian IAVs to other hosts, including humans, before their spillover. Continued surveillance to monitor the distribution and antigenic diversities of IAVs in feral swine is necessary to increase our understanding of the natural history of IAVs.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> There are more than 5 million feral swine distributed across at least 35 states in the United States. In contrast to domestic swine, feral swine are free ranging and have unique opportunities for contact with wildlife, livestock, and their habitats. Our serological results indicate that feral swine in the United States have been exposed to influenza A viruses (IAVs) consistent with those found in both domestic swine and wild birds, with the predominant infections consisting of swine-adapted IAVs. Our findings suggest that feral swine have been infected with IAVs at low levels and could serve as hosts for the generation of novel IAVs at the interface of feral swine, wild birds, domestic swine, and humans.

Title: New insights into influenza A specificity: an evolution of paradigms.
Abstract: Understanding the molecular origin of influenza receptor specificity is complicated by the paucity of quantitative affinity measurements, and the qualitative and variable nature of glycan array data. Further obstacles arise from the varied impact of viral glycosylation and the relatively narrow spectrum of biologically relevant receptors present on glycan arrays. A survey of receptor conformational properties is presented, leading to the conclusion that conformational entropy plays a key role in defining specificity, as does the newly reported ability of biantennary receptors that terminate in Siaα2-6Gal sequences to form bidentate interactions to two binding sites in a hemagglutinin trimer. Bidentate binding provides a functional explanation for the observation that Siaα2-6 receptors adopt an open-umbrella topology when bound to hemagglutinins from human-infective viruses, and calls for a reassessment of virus avidity and tissue tropism.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses molecular and structural aspects of influenza receptor specificity but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity in the United States During the 2016-17 Season and Composition of the 2017-18 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2016-17 influenza season (October 2, 2016-May 20, 2017) in the United States, influenza activity* was moderate. Activity remained low through November, increased during December, and peaked in February nationally, although there were regional differences in the timing of influenza activity. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated through mid-March and were predominant overall for the season, but influenza B viruses were most commonly reported from late March through May. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during October 2, 2016-May 20, 2017<sup>†</sup> and updates the previous summary (1).

Title: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus infection associated with respiratory signs in sloth bears (Melursus ursinus).
Abstract: In 2009, a pandemic influenza A virus (pH1N1) spread globally in humans and infected a broad range of captive animals with close human contact. In February 2014, a pH1N1 virus was isolated from a sloth bear with respiratory signs at a US zoo, demonstrating that recurring epidemics present an ongoing threat to animals, including threatened species. This is the first report of pH1N1 infection in sloth bears. To understand the sloth bear virus within the global context of pH1N1, phylogenetic trees were inferred including full-length sequences from available non-human, non-swine hosts, representing four families in the order Carnivora and one order of birds. A combination of phylogenetic and epidemiological evidence strongly suggests the sloth bear was infected with a human-origin pH1N1 virus, supporting the implementation of biosecurity measures to protect human and animal health.

Title: Serological and virological surveillance of avian influenza virus in domestic ducks of the north-east region of Bangladesh.
Abstract: Wild waterfowl are considered as the natural reservoir for avian influenza (AI) viruses. Bangladesh has been experiencing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks since 2007, mostly in chickens and occasionally in ducks. Ducks play an important role in the persistence and genetic recombination of AI viruses. This paper presents the results of serological and virological monitoring of AI in domestic ducks in 2013 in the north-east region of Bangladesh. A total of 871 and 662 serum samples and 909 and 302 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from domestic ducks of Mymensingh and Sylhet division, respectively, were analysed. Antibodies to type A influenza virus were detected by blocking ELISA in 60.73 and 47.73% serum samples of Mymensingh and Sylhet division, respectively. On haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test 17.5% of ELISA positive serum samples were found to be seropositive to H5 avian influenza virus. Five cloacal swabs and one oropharyngeal swab were positive for M gene of type A influenza virus by real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), but all of them were negative for H5 influenza virus. Three of the six viruses were successfully characterized as H1N5, H2N5 and H7N5 subtype of AI virus, the other three remained uncharacterized. On sequencing and phylogenetic analysis the HA and NA genes were found to be of Eurasian avian lineage. The H7 virus had cleavage site motif of low pathogenic virus. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were detected from apparently healthy domestic ducks. A small proportion of domestic ducks were found seropositive to H5 AI virus.

Title: Effect of genomic drift of influenza PCR tests.
Abstract: Nucleic acid amplification assays have become the method of choice for influenza (Flu) testing due to superior accuracy and faster turnaround time. Although assays are designed to detect highly conserved genomic targets, mutations can influence test sensitivity. Most of the circulating viruses in the United States during the 2014-2015 season were associated with significant genetic drift; however, the effect on testing was unknown. We compared the performance of Prodesse ProFlu+/ProFAST+ (PFlu/PFAST), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP), cobas<sup>®</sup> Influenza A/B test (cIAB), and Xpert<sup>®</sup> Flu (Xpt) in a retrospective analysis of consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens received for a two-week period during the winter of 2015. Furthermore, limits of detection (LOD) were determined with six isolates of Flu. Of the 275 specimens, 63 were positive for FluA by PFAST, 60 were positive by RP, 58 were positive by cIAB and 52 were positive by Xpt. Only a subset of 135 specimens was tested by PFlu, of which 32 were positive. The sensitivity/specificity for PFAST, RP, cIAB, Xpt and PFlu was 100/99.1%, 96.7/99.5%, 91.8/99.1%, 85.2%/100%, and 75.6%/98.9%, respectively. LOD analyses demonstrated assay performance variations were strain associated. Specifically, PFlu's and cIAB's LODs were higher with A/Texas/50/2012-like and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strains, while Xpt's highest LOD was with the Swiss strain. Strain-associated assay performance variation is known to occur with other Flu test methods; hence, it is not surprising that such variation would be observed with molecular tests. Careful monitoring and reporting for strain-associated variances are warranted for all test methods.

Title: AGO2 Negatively Regulates Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway by Competition Binding IRF3 with CBP/p300.
Abstract: Viral infection triggers a series of signaling cascades and host innate immune responses, including interferon (IFN) production, which depends on coordinated activity of multiple transcription factors. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 are core factors that participate in transcriptional complex formation in the nucleus. In general, cells balance the production of IFNs through suppressive and stimulative mechanisms, but viral infections can disrupt such equilibrium. This study determined that H5N1 viral infection reduced the distribution of human argonaute 2 (AGO2) in A549 cell nucleus. AGO2 did not block phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding ability of IRF3 but inhibited its association with CBP. Therefore, this newly revealed mechanism shows that cellular response leads to transfer of AGO2 from cell nucleus and promotes IFN-β expression to increase host survival during viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host cell protein interactions affecting interferon signaling, not viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: The impact of migratory flyways on the spread of avian influenza virus in North America.
Abstract: Wild birds are the major reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses (AIVs) and have been implicated in the emergence of pandemic events in livestock and human populations. Understanding how AIVs spread within and across continents is therefore critical to the development of successful strategies to manage and reduce the impact of influenza outbreaks. In North America many bird species undergo seasonal migratory movements along a North-South axis, thereby providing opportunities for viruses to spread over long distances. However, the role played by such avian flyways in shaping the genetic structure of AIV populations remains uncertain. To assess the relative contribution of bird migration along flyways to the genetic structure of AIV we performed a large-scale phylogeographic study of viruses sampled in the USA and Canada, involving the analysis of 3805 to 4505 sequences from 36 to 38 geographic localities depending on the gene segment data set. To assist in this we developed a maximum likelihood-based genetic algorithm to explore a wide range of complex spatial models, depicting a more complete picture of the migration network than determined previously. Based on phylogenies estimated from nucleotide sequence data sets, our results show that AIV migration rates are significantly higher within than between flyways, indicating that the migratory patterns of birds play a key role in viral dispersal. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolution, maintenance and transmission of AIVs, in turn allowing the development of improved programs for surveillance and risk assessment.

Title: Does influenza pandemic preparedness and mitigation require gain-of-function research?
Abstract: The risk and benefits of gain-of-function studies on influenza A have been widely debated since 2012 when the methods to create two respiratory transmissible H5N1 mutant isolates were published. Opponents of gain-of-function studies argue the biosecurity risk is unacceptable, while proponents cite potential uses for pandemic surveillance, preparedness and mitigation. In this commentary, we provide an overview of the background and applications of gain-of-function research and argue that the anticipated benefits have yet to materialize while the significant risks remain.

Title: Design and expeditious synthesis of organosilanes as potent antivirals targeting multidrug-resistant influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The efficacy of current influenza vaccines and small molecule antiviral drugs is curtailed by the emerging of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses. As resistance to the only FDA-approved oral influenza antiviral, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), continues to rise, there is a clear need to develop the next-generation of antiviral drugs. Since more than 95% of current circulating influenza A viruses carry the S31N mutation in their M2 genes, the AM2-S31N mutant proton channel represents an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals. In this study we report the design and synthesis of the first class of organosilanes that have potent antiviral activity against a panel of human clinical isolates of influenza A viruses, including viruses that are resistant to amantadine, oseltamivir, or both.

Title: A coevolution analysis for identifying protein-protein interactions by Fourier transform.
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play key roles in life processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulations, and immune response, etc. Identification of PPIs enables better understanding of the functional networks within a cell. Common experimental methods for identifying PPIs are time consuming and expensive. However, recent developments in computational approaches for inferring PPIs from protein sequences based on coevolution theory avoid these problems. In the coevolution theory model, interacted proteins may show coevolutionary mutations and have similar phylogenetic trees. The existing coevolution methods depend on multiple sequence alignments (MSA); however, the MSA-based coevolution methods often produce high false positive interactions. In this paper, we present a computational method using an alignment-free approach to accurately detect PPIs and reduce false positives. In the method, protein sequences are numerically represented by biochemical properties of amino acids, which reflect the structural and functional differences of proteins. Fourier transform is applied to the numerical representation of protein sequences to capture the dissimilarities of protein sequences in biophysical context. The method is assessed for predicting PPIs in Ebola virus. The results indicate strong coevolution between the protein pairs (NP-VP24, NP-VP30, NP-VP40, VP24-VP30, VP24-VP40, and VP30-VP40). The method is also validated for PPIs in influenza and E.coli genomes. Since our method can reduce false positive and increase the specificity of PPI prediction, it offers an effective tool to understand mechanisms of disease pathogens and find potential targets for drug design. The Python programs in this study are available to public at URL (https://github.com/cyinbox/PPI).

Title: The MEK-inhibitor CI-1040 displays a broad anti-influenza virus activity in vitro and provides a prolonged treatment window compared to standard of care in vivo.
Abstract: Influenza viruses (IV) continue to pose an imminent threat to human welfare. Yearly re-occurring seasonal epidemic outbreaks and pandemics with high mortality can occur. Besides vaccination against a limited number of viral strains only a few antiviral drugs are available, which are losing their effectiveness as more and more IV strains become resistant. Thus, new antiviral approaches that omit IV resistance are urgently needed. Here, the dependency on the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway for IV replication opens a new perspective. In consequence, we studied the antiviral potential of the MEK inhibitor Cl-1040 (PD184352). We show that Cl-1040 significantly reduces virus titers in vitro via retention of viral RNP complexes in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, Cl-1040 is effective against a broad range of IV strains, including highly pathogenic avian IV, as well as against a Tamiflu<sup>®</sup>-resistant IV strain. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that Cl-1040 can reduce IV lung titers in vivo. Importantly, the treatment window for Cl-1040 expands up to 48 h post infection when Tamiflu<sup>®</sup> treatment has no effect. In conclusion, Cl-1040 offers an interesting perspective for anti-IV approaches.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the antiviral activity of a MEK inhibitor targeting host cell pathways rather than viral genotypes or phenotypes directly.

Title: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak detected in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of influenza-like illness in Pune, India, 2012-2015.
Abstract: An outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected during the ongoing community-based surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). Among reported 119 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases (59 cases in the year 2012 and 60 cases in 2015) in summer months, common clinical features were fever (100%), cough (90·7%), sore throat (85·7%), nasal discharge (48·7%), headache (55·5%), fatigue (18·5%), breathlessness (3·4%), and ear discharge (1·7%). Rise in ILI cases were negatively correlated with the seasonal factors such as relative humidity (Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient, i.e. r = -0·71 in the year 2012 and r = -0·44 in the year 2015), while rise in ILI cases were positively correlated with the temperature difference (r = 0·44 in the year 2012 and r = 0·77 in the year 2015). The effective reproduction number R, was estimated to be 1·30 in 2012 and 1·64 in 2015. The study highlights the rise in unusual influenza activity in summer month with high attack rate of ILI among children aged ⩽9 years. Children in this age group may need special attention for influenza vaccination. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was confirmed in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of ILI in Pune, India, 2012-2015.

Title: Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).
Abstract: Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, and affects the epidemiology of infectious diseases. However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population. We also demonstrate that AstroV might be a larger burden to urban ducks than IAV, and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses. The presence of economically relevant viruses in urban Mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments, which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife, food production animals, and humans.

Reason: The study focuses on epidemiology and virus prevalence in urban Mallards without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Abstract: During 2014–2016 HPAI outbreak in South Korea, H5N8 viruses have been mostly isolated in western areas of the country, which provide wintering habitats for wild birds and have a high density of poultry. Analysis of a total of 101 Korean isolates revealed that primitive H5N8 viruses (C0 group) have evolved into multiple genetic subgroups appearing from various epidemiological sources, namely, the viruses circulating in poultry farms (C1 and C5) and those reintroduced by migratory birds in late 2014 (C2 and C4). No C3 groups were detected. The results may explain the possible reasons of the recent long-term persistence of H5N8 viruses in South Korea, and help to develop the effective measures in controlling HPAI viruses.

Title: Highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza A viruses recovered from wild birds in Guangdong, southern China, 2014-2015.
Abstract: Since 2013, highly pathogenic (HP) H5N6 influenza A viruses (IAVs) have emerged in poultry in Asia, especially Southeast Asia. These viruses have also caused sporadic infections in humans within the same geographic areas. Active IAV surveillance in wild birds sampled in Guangdong province, China from August 2014 through February 2015 resulted in the recovery of three H5N6 IAVs. These H5N6 IAV isolates possess the basic amino acid motif at the HA1-HA2 cleavage site that is associated with highly pathogenic IAVs infecting chickens. Noteworthy findings include: (1) the HP H5N6 IAV isolates were recovered from three species of apparently healthy wild birds (most other isolates of HP H5N6 IAV in Asia are recovered from dead wild birds or fecal samples in the environment) and (2) these isolates were apparently the first recoveries of HP H5N6 IAV for two of the three species thus expanding the demonstrated natural host range for these lineages of virus. This investigation provides additional insight into the natural history of HP H5N6 IAVs and identifies the occurrence of non-lethal, HP H5N6 IAV infections in wild birds thereby demonstrating the value of active IAV surveillance in wild birds.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza viruses in South Korea between 2012 and 2014.
Abstract: National surveillance of avian influenza virus (AIV) in South Korea has been annually conducted for the early detection of AIV and responses to the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. In this study, we report on a nationwide surveillance study of AIV in domestic poultry and wild birds in South Korea between 2012 and 2014. During the surveillance programs between 2012 and 2014, 141,560 samples were collected. Of these, 102,199 were from poultry farms, 8215 were from LBMs, and 31,146 were from wild bird habitats. The virus isolation was performed by inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs and AIV isolates were detected using hemagglutination assay. For subtying of AIV, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were confirmed by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the H5 subtypes was performed using 28 H5 AIV isolates. Between 2012 and 2014, a total of 819 AIV were isolated from 141,560 samples. Virus isolation rates for AIV were 0.6, 0.4, 0.1, and 2.7% in wild birds (n = 202), domestic ducks (n = 387), minor poultry (n = 11), and the live bird market (LBM) (n = 219), respectively. In wild birds, various subtypes were found including H1-H7 and H9-H13. The major subtypes were H5 (n = 48, 23.9%: N3 (n = 4) and N8 (n = 44)), H4 (n = 39, 19.4%), and H1 (n = 29, 14.4%). In domestic poultry, mainly ducks, the H5N8 (n = 275, 59.3%), H3 (n = 30, 17.2%), and H6 (n = 53, 11.4%) subtypes were predominantly found. The most frequently detected subtypes in LBM, primarily Korean native chicken, were H9 (n = 169, 77.2%). H3 (n = 10, 4%) and H6 (n = 30, 13.7%) were also isolated in LBM. Overall, the prevalence of AIV was found to be higher between winter and spring and in western parts of South Korea. The unusual high prevalence of the H5 subtype of AIV was due to the large scale outbreak of H5N8 HPAI in wild birds and domestic poultry in 2014. Enhanced surveillance and application of effective control measures in wild birds and domestic poultry, including LBM, should be implemented to control AI and eradicate HPAI.
Relevant: False

Title: Expeditious Lead Optimization of Isoxazole-Containing Influenza A Virus M2-S31N Inhibitors Using the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction.
Abstract: The existence of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses, coupled with the continuously antigenic shift and antigenic drift of influenza viruses, necessitates the development of the next-generation of influenza antivirals. As the AM2-S31N mutant persists in more than 95% of current circulating influenza A viruses, targeting the AM2-S31N proton channel appears to be a logical and valid approach to combating drug resistance. Starting from compound 1, an isoxazole compound with potent AM2-S31N channel blockage and antiviral activity, in this study we report an expeditious synthetic strategy that allows us to promptly explore the structure-activity relationships of isoxazole-containing AM2-S31N inhibitors. Propelled by the convenient synthesis, the lead optimization effort yielded a number of potent antivirals with submicromolar efficacy against several human clinical isolates of influenza A viruses, including both oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on chemical synthesis and optimization of antiviral compounds targeting a viral protein mutation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Bayesian phylogeography of influenza A/H3N2 for the 2014-15 season in the United States using three frameworks of ancestral state reconstruction.
Abstract: Ancestral state reconstructions in Bayesian phylogeography of virus pandemics have been improved by utilizing a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) framework. Recently, this framework has been extended to model the transition rate matrix between discrete states as a generalized linear model (GLM) of genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors of interest to the virus and incorporating BSSVS to estimate the posterior inclusion probabilities of each predictor. Although the latter appears to enhance the biological validity of ancestral state reconstruction, there has yet to be a comparison of phylogenies created by the two methods. In this paper, we compare these two methods, while also using a primitive method without BSSVS, and highlight the differences in phylogenies created by each. We test six coalescent priors and six random sequence samples of H3N2 influenza during the 2014-15 flu season in the U.S. We show that the GLMs yield significantly greater root state posterior probabilities than the two alternative methods under five of the six priors, and significantly greater Kullback-Leibler divergence values than the two alternative methods under all priors. Furthermore, the GLMs strongly implicate temperature and precipitation as driving forces of this flu season and nearly unanimously identified a single root state, which exhibits the most tropical climate during a typical flu season in the U.S. The GLM, however, appears to be highly susceptible to sampling bias compared with the other methods, which casts doubt on whether its reconstructions should be favored over those created by alternate methods. We report that a BSSVS approach with a Poisson prior demonstrates less bias toward sample size under certain conditions than the GLMs or primitive models, and believe that the connection between reconstruction method and sampling bias warrants further investigation.
Relevant: False

Title: The characteristics and antigenic properties of recently emerged subclade 3C.3a and 3C.2a human influenza A(H3N2) viruses passaged in MDCK cells.
Abstract: Two new subclades of influenza A(H3N2) viruses became prominent during the 2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The HA glycoproteins of these viruses showed sequence changes previously associated with alterations in receptor-binding properties. To address how these changes influence virus propagation, viruses were isolated and propagated in conventional MDCK cells and MDCK-SIAT1 cells, cells with enhanced expression of the human receptor for the virus, and analysed at each passage. Gene sequence analysis was undertaken as virus was passaged in conventional MDCK cells and MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Alterations in receptor recognition associated with passage of virus were examined by haemagglutination assays using red blood cells from guinea pigs, turkeys and humans. Microneutralisation assays were performed to determine how passage-acquired amino acid substitutions and polymorphisms affected virus antigenicity. Viruses were able to infect MDCK-SIAT1 cells more efficiently than conventional MDCK cells. Viruses of both the 3C.2a and 3C.3a subclades showed greater sequence change on passage in conventional MDCK cells than in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, with amino acid substitutions being seen in both HA and NA glycoproteins. However, virus passage in MDCK-SIAT1 cells at low inoculum dilutions showed reducing infectivity on continued passage. Current H3N2 viruses should be cultured in the MDCK-SIAT1 cell line to maintain faithful replication of the virus, and at an appropriate multiplicity of infection to retain infectivity.

Title: Vaccination has minimal impact on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses.
Abstract: While influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, the factors that influence the virus' rapid evolution within and between human hosts are less clear. Given the modest effectiveness of seasonal vaccination, vaccine-induced antibody responses could serve as a potent selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. Importantly, this study design allowed us to isolate the impact of vaccination while still studying natural infection. We used pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers to quantify vaccine-induced immunity directly and to assess its impact on intrahost populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 5119 person-years. We obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples and used a stringent and empirically validated analysis pipeline to identify intrahost single nucleotide variants at ≥1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season HAI and NAI titer, respectively. In our study population, we found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems, our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study examines the impact of vaccination on intrahost viral diversity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Infection by Fucoidan Targeting Viral Neuraminidase and Cellular EGFR Pathway.
Abstract: Development of novel anti-influenza A virus (IAV) drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity is critical for preparedness against influenza outbreaks. Herein, we investigated the anti-IAV activities and mechanisms of fucoidan in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that a fucoidan KW derived from brown algae Kjellmaniella crassifolia effectively blocked IAV infection in vitro with low toxicity. KW possessed broad anti-IAV spectrum and low tendency of induction of viral resistance, superior to the anti-IAV drug amantadine. KW was capable of inactivating virus particles before infection and blocked some stages after adsorption. KW could bind to viral neuraminidase (NA) and inhibit the activity of NA to block the release of IAV. KW also interfered with the activation of EGFR, PKCα, NF-κB, and Akt, and inhibited both IAV endocytosis and EGFR internalization in IAV-infected cells, suggesting that KW may also inhibit cellular EGFR pathway. Moreover, intranasal administration of KW markedly improved survival and decreased viral titers in IAV-infected mice. Therefore, fucoidan KW has the potential to be developed into a novel nasal drop or spray for prevention and treatment of influenza in the future.

Title: Novel real-time PCR-based patho- and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza A subtype H5 viruses at risk of incursion into Europe in 2017.
Abstract: Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities. Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5 viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.

Title: Molecular Evidence of Transmission of Influenza A/H1N1 2009 on a University Campus.
Abstract: In the recent years, the data on the molecular epidemiology of influenza viruses have expanded enormously because of the availability of cutting-edge sequencing technologies. However, much of the information is from the temperate regions with few studies from tropical regions such as South-east Asia. Despite the fact that influenza has been known to transmit rapidly within semi-closed communities, such as military camps and educational institutions, data are limited from these communities. To determine the phylogeography of influenza viruses on a university campus, we examined the spatial distribution of influenza virus on the National University of Singapore (NUS) campus. Consenting students from the NUS who sought medical attention at the UHC provided two nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic data. PCR was used for detection of influenza viruses. 34 full-genomes of pH1N1/09 viruses were successfully sequenced by Sanger method and concatenated using Geneious R7. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using these 34 sequences and 1518 global sequences. Phylogeographic analysis was done using BaTS software and Association index and Fitch parsimony scores were determined. Integrating whole genome sequencing data with epidemiological data, we found strong evidence of influenza transmission on campus as isolates from students residing on-campus were highly similar to each other (AI, P value = 0.009; PS, P value = 0.04). There was also evidence of multiple introductions from the community. Such data are useful in formulating pandemic preparedness plans which can use these communities as sentinel sites for detection and monitoring of emerging respiratory viral infections.

Title: Optimization of a Quantitative Micro-neutralization Assay.
Abstract: The micro-neutralization (MN) assay is a standard technique for measuring the infectivity of the influenza virus and the inhibition of virus replication. In this study, we present the protocol of an imaging-based MN assay to quantify the true antigenic relationships between viruses. Unlike typical plaque reduction assays that rely on visible plaques, this assay quantitates the entire infected cell population of each well. The protocol matches the virus type or subtype with the selection of cell lines to achieve maximum infectivity, which enhances sample contrast during imaging and image processing. The introduction of quantitative titration defines the amount of input viruses of neutralization and enables the results from different experiments to be comparable. The imaging setup with a flatbed scanner and free downloadable software makes the approach high throughput, cost effective, user friendly, and easy to deploy in most laboratories. Our study demonstrates that the improved MN assay works well with the current circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses, without being significantly influenced by amino acid substitutions in the neuraminidase (NA) of A(H3N2) viruses. It is particularly useful for the characterization of viruses that either grow to low HA titer and/or undergo an abortive infection resulting in an inability to form plaques in cultured cells.

Reason: The paper describes an improved micro-neutralization assay for measuring infectivity and antigenic relationships but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Glucocorticoid Insensitivity in Virally Infected Airway Epithelial Cells Is Dependent on Transforming Growth Factor-β Activity.
Abstract: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are commonly associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV) and influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The ensuing airway inflammation is resistant to the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids (GCs). Viral infection elicits transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity, a growth factor we have previously shown to impair GC action in human airway epithelial cells through the activation of activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5), the type 1 receptor of TGF-β. In the current study, we examine the contribution of TGF-β activity to the GC-resistance caused by viral infection. We demonstrate that viral infection of human bronchial epithelial cells with RSV, RV or IAV impairs GC anti-inflammatory action. Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, also impairs GC activity. Both viral infection and poly(I:C) increase TGF-β expression and activity. Importantly, the GC impairment was attenuated by the selective ALK5 (TGFβRI) inhibitor, SB431542 and prevented by the therapeutic agent, tranilast, which reduced TGF-β activity associated with viral infection. This study shows for the first time that viral-induced glucocorticoid-insensitivity is partially mediated by activation of endogenous TGF-β.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates glucocorticoid insensitivity mediated by host TGF-β activity during viral infection, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The differentiated airway epithelium infected by influenza viruses maintains the barrier function despite a dramatic loss of ciliated cells.
Abstract: Virus-host interactions in the respiratory epithelium during long term influenza virus infection are not well characterized. Therefore, we developed an air-liquid interface culture system for differentiated porcine respiratory epithelial cells to study the effect of virus-induced cellular damage. In our well-differentiated cells, α2,6-linked sialic acid is predominantly expressed on the apical surface and the basal cells mainly express α2,3-linked sialic acid. During the whole infection period, release of infectious virus was maintained at a high titre for more than seven days. The infected epithelial cells were subject to apoptosis resulting in the loss of ciliated cells together with a thinner thickness. Nevertheless, the airway epithelium maintained trans-epithelial electrical resistance and retained its barrier function. The loss of ciliated cells was compensated by the cells which contained the KRT5 basal cell marker but were not yet differentiated into ciliated cells. These specialized cells showed an increase of α2,3-linked sialic acid on the apical surface. In sum, our results help to explain the localized infection of the airway epithelium by influenza viruses. The impairment of mucociliary clearance in the epithelial cells provides an explanation why prior viral infection renders the host more susceptible to secondary co-infection by another pathogen.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies airway epithelial response to influenza infection focusing on cellular damage and barrier function, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Abstract: Objective This study evaluates the difference between winter influenza and summer influenza in Okinawa. Methods From January 2007 to June 2014, weekly rapid antigen test (RAT) results performed in four acute care hospitals were collected for the surveillance of regional influenza prevalence in the Naha region of the Okinawa Islands. Results An antigenic data analysis revealed that multiple H1N1 and H3N2 viruses consistently co-circulate in Okinawa, creating synchronized seasonal patterns and a high genetic diversity of influenza A. Additionally, influenza B viruses play a significant role in summer epidemics, almost every year. To further understand influenza epidemics during the summer in Okinawa, we evaluated the full genome sequences of some representative human influenza A and influenza B viruses isolated in Okinawa. Phylogenetic data analysis also revealed that multiple H1N1 and H3N2 viruses consistently co-circulate in Okinawa. Conclusion This surveillance revealed a distinct epidemic pattern of seasonal and pandemic influenza in this subtropical region.

Title: Assessing Change in Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Infections During the Fourth Epidemic - China, September 2015-August 2016.
Abstract: Since human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were first reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) in March 2013 (1), mainland China has experienced four influenza A(H7N9) virus epidemics. Prior investigations demonstrated that age and sex distribution, clinical features, and exposure history of A(H7N9) virus human infections reported during the first three epidemics were similar (2). In this report, epidemiology and virology data from the most recent, fourth epidemic (September 2015-August 2016) were compared with those from the three earlier epidemics. Whereas age and sex distribution and exposure history in the fourth epidemic were similar to those in the first three epidemics, the fourth epidemic demonstrated a greater proportion of infected persons living in rural areas, a continued spread of the virus to new areas, and a longer epidemic period. The genetic markers of mammalian adaptation and antiviral resistance remained similar across each epidemic, and viruses from the fourth epidemic remained antigenically well matched to current candidate vaccine viruses. Although there is no evidence of increased human-to-human transmissibility of A(H7N9) viruses, the continued geographic spread, identification of novel reassortant viruses, and pandemic potential of the virus underscore the importance of rigorous A(H7N9) virus surveillance and continued risk assessment in China and neighboring countries.

Title: Iminosugars: Promising therapeutics for influenza infection.
Abstract: Influenza virus causes three to five million severe respiratory infections per year in seasonal epidemics, and sporadic pandemics, three of which occurred in the twentieth century and are a continuing global threat. Currently licensed antivirals exclusively target the viral neuraminidase or M2 ion channel, and emerging drug resistance necessitates the development of novel therapeutics. It is believed that a host-targeted strategy may combat the development of antiviral drug resistance. To this end, a class of molecules known as iminosugars, hydroxylated carbohydrate mimics with the endocyclic oxygen atom replaced by a nitrogen atom, are being investigated for their broad-spectrum antiviral potential. The influenza virus glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are susceptible to inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidases by certain iminosugars, leading to reduced virion production or infectivity, demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In some experiments, viral strain-specific effects are observed. Iminosugars may also inhibit other host and virus targets with antiviral consequences. While investigations of anti-influenza iminosugar activities have been conducted since the 1980s, recent successes of nojirimycin derivatives have re-invigorated investigation of the therapeutic potential of iminosugars as orally available, low cytotoxicity, effective anti-influenza drugs.

Title: Characterization of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Virus Prevalence in Humans and Poultry in Huai'an, China: Molecular Epidemiology, Phylogenetic, and Dynamics Analyses.
Abstract: To trace the source of human H7N9 cases in Huai'an and elucidate the genetic characterization of Huai'an strains associated with both humans and birds in live poultry market. An enhanced surveillance was implemented when the first human H7N9 case was confirmed in Huai'an. Clinical specimens, cloacal swabs, and fecal samples were collected and screened by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for H7N9 virus. The positive samples were subjected to further RT-PCR and genome sequencing. The phylodynamic patterns of H7N9 virus within and separated from Huai'an and evolutionary dynamics of the virus were analyzed. Six patients with H7N9 infection were previously exposed to live poultry market and presented symptoms such as fever (>38.0 °C) and headaches. Results of this study support the hypothesis that live poultry markets were the source of human H7N9 exposure. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all novel H7N9 viruses, including Huai'an strains, could be classified into two distinct clades, A and B. Additionally, the diversified H7N9 virus circulated in live poultry markets in Huai'an. Interestingly, the common ancestors of the Huai'an H7N9 virus existed in January 2012. The mean nucleotide substitution rates for each gene segment of the H7N9 virus were (3.09-7.26)×10-3 substitutions/site per year (95% HPD: 1.72×10-3 to 1.16×10-2). Overall, the source of exposure of human H7N9 cases in Huai'an was live poultry market, and our study highlights the presence of divergent genetic lineage of H7N9 virus in both humans and poultry specimens in Huai'an.

Title: Genesis, Evolution and Prevalence of H5N6 Avian Influenza Viruses in China.
Abstract: Constant surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) is currently the best way to predict and identify emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) that pose a potential threat to public health. Through surveillance of LPMs from 16 provinces and municipalities in China during 2014-2016, we identified 3,174 AIV-positive samples and isolated and sequenced 1,135 AIVs covering 31 subtypes. Our analysis shows that H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as one of the dominant AIV subtypes in southern China, especially in ducks. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N6 arose from reassortments of H5 and H6N6 viruses, with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations being strongly lineage specific. H5N6 viruses constitute at least 34 distinct genotypes derived from various evolutionary pathways. Notably, genotype G1.2 virus, with internal genes from the chicken H9N2/H7N9 gene pool, was responsible for at least five human H5N6 infections. Our findings highlight H5N6 AIVs as potential threats to public health and agriculture.

Title: Predominance and geo-mapping of avian influenza H5N1 in poultry sectors in Egypt.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype has been enzootic in the Egyptian poultry with significant human infections since 2008. This work evaluates the epidemiological and virological information from February 2006 to May 2015 in spatial and temporal terms. Only data with confirmed HPAI H5N1 sub-type were collected, and matched with the epidemiological data from various spatially and temporally-dispersed surveillances implemented between 2006 and 2015. Spatio-temporal analysis was conducted on a total of 3338 confirmed H5N1 HPAI poultry disease outbreaks and outputs described based on transmission patterns, poultry species, production types affected, trade, geographic and temporal distributions in Egypt. The H5N1 virus persists in the Egyptian poultry displaying a seasonal pattern with peak prevalence between January and March. There was no specific geographic pattern, but chickens and ducks were more affected. However, relatively higher disease incidences were recorded in the Nile Delta. Phylogenetic studies of the haemagglutinin gene sequences of H5N1 viruses indicated that multiple clusters circulated between 2006 and 2015, with significant deviations in circulation. Epidemiological dynamics of HPAI has changed with the origins of majority of outbreaks shifted to household poultry. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 in poultry with recurrent and sporadic infections in humans can influence virus evolution spatio-temporally. Household poultry plays significant roles in the H5N1 virus transmission to poultry and humans, but the role of commercial poultry needs further clarifications. While poultry trading supports the persistence and transmission of H5N1, the role of individual species may warrant further investigation. Surveillance activities, applying a multi-sectoral approach, are recommended.

Title: Effect of Live Poultry Market Interventions on Influenza A(H7N9) Virus, Guangdong, China.
Abstract: Since March 2013, three waves of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been detected in China. To investigate virus transmission within and across epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong during 2013-2015. We observed a geographic shift of human A(H7N9) infections from the second to the third waves. Live poultry market interventions were undertaken in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis indicated that the third-wave outbreaks in central Guangdong most likely resulted from local virus persistence rather than introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of clinical cases in humans declined by 35% from the second to the third waves, the genetic diversity of third-wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk to a region reporting comparatively few A(H7N9) cases. Moreover, our results suggest that live-poultry market interventions cannot completely halt A(H7N9) virus persistence and dissemination.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes epidemiological and phylogenetic data on H7N9 virus persistence and spread but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Origin, distribution, and potential risk factors associated with influenza A virus in swine in two production systems in Guatemala.
Abstract: Guatemala is the country with the largest swine production in Central America; however, evidence of influenza A virus (IAV) in pigs has not been clearly delineated. In this study, we analyzed the presence and spatial distribution of IAV in commercial and backyard swine populations. Samples from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were tested using virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays to detect IAV. Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% of the sampled pigs (30.6% of herds) in 2010 and in 11.7% (24.2% of herds) in 2011. The percentage of seropositive pigs was 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) for each year, respectively. Three pandemic H1N1 and one seasonal human-like H3N2 viruses were isolated. Antibodies against viruses from different genetic clusters were detected. No reassortant strains with swine viruses were detected. The H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses that circulated in Central America in 2010, distinct to the most recent human seasonal vaccine lineages. Spatial clusters of rRT-PCR positive herds were detected each year by scan statistics. Our results demonstrate circulation of IAV throughout Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status, and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. Detection of human-origin viruses in pigs suggests a role for humans in the molecular epidemiology of IAV in swine in Guatemala and evidences gaps in local animal and human surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the presence, distribution, and risk factors of influenza A virus in swine populations without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Predicted Enhanced Human Propensity of Current Avian-Like H1N1 Swine Influenza Virus from China.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes against which little or no pre-existing immunity exists in humans represent a serious threat to global public health. Monitoring of IAV in animal hosts is essential for early and rapid detection of potential pandemic IAV strains to prevent their spread. Recently, the increased pandemic potential of the avian-like swine H1N1 IAV A/swine/Guangdong/104/2013 has been suggested. The virus is infectious in humans and the general population seems to lack neutralizing antibodies against this virus. Here we present an in silico analysis that shows a strong human propensity of this swine virus further confirming its pandemic potential. We suggest mutations which would further enhance its human propensity. We also propose conserved antigenic determinants which could serve as a component of a prepandemic vaccine. The bioinformatics tool, which can be used to further monitor the evolution of swine influenza viruses towards a pandemic virus, are described here and are made publically available (http://www.vin.bg.ac.rs/180/tools/iav_mon.php; http://www.biomedprotection.com/iav_mon.php).
Relevant: False
Reason: The study is an in silico analysis predicting human propensity of a swine influenza virus based on sequence data but does not experimentally link genotype to phenotype.

Title: Ecological dynamics of influenza A viruses: cross-species transmission and global migration.
Abstract: A comprehensive study of cross-species transmission and inter-regional migration would provide insights into the global ecology of influenza A viruses (IAVs). To this end, we assembled 17,241 non-redundant IAV whole-genome sequences with complete epidemiological information. We hierarchically divided the movements of IAVs into the cross-species transmission in each region and the inter-regional migration driven by each host species. We then systematically identified the potential cross-species transmission and inter-regional migration events. Cross-species transmission networks were obtained for each gene segment of the IAVs. Waterfowl, domestic birds and swine showed higher degrees of connection than did other species in all of the transmission networks. East Asia and Southeast Asia were hot regions for avian-mammal transmissions. Swine and migratory birds were the dominant species for global virus delivery. The importance of swine was reemphasized because it has not only provided an environment for adaptive evolution during the avian-human transmission of IAVs (as incubators) but also served as a key species for the global dissemination of the viruses (as carriers). Therefore, monitoring the global live trade of swine and survey of migratory birds along flyways would be beneficial for the prevention and control of IAVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes cross-species transmission and migration patterns of influenza A viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Co-expression of sialic acid receptors compatible with avian and human influenza virus binding in emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae).
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to threaten animal and human health with constant emergence of novel variants. While aquatic birds are a major reservoir of most IAVs, the role of other terrestrial birds in the evolution of IAVs is becoming increasingly evident. Since 2006, several reports of IAV isolations from emus have surfaced and avian influenza infection of emus can lead to the selection of mammalian like PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N mutants. However, the potential of emus to be co-infected with avian and mammalian IAVs is not yet understood. As a first step, we investigated sialic acid (SA) receptor distribution across major organs and body systems of emu and found a widespread co-expression of both SAα2,3Gal and SAα2,6Gal receptors in various tissues that are compatible with avian and human IAV binding. Our results suggest that emus could allow genetic recombination and hence play an important role in the evolution of IAVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates receptor distribution in emu tissues relevant to influenza binding but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fatal Cases of Seasonal Influenza in Russia in 2015-2016.
Abstract: The influenza epidemic in 2015-2016 in Russia is characterized by a sharp increase of influenza cases (beginning from the second week of 2016) with increased fatalities. Influenza was confirmed in 20 fatal cases registered among children (0-10 years), in 5 cases among pregnant women, and in 173 cases among elderly people (60 years and older). Two hundred and ninety nine people died from influenza were patients with some chronic problems. The overwhelming majority among the deceased (more than 98%) were not vaccinated against influenza. We isolated 109 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and one A(H3N2) virus strains from 501 autopsy material samples. The antigenic features of the strains were similar to the vaccine strains. A phylogenic analysis of hemagglutinin revealed that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains belonged to 6B genetic group that had two main dominant subgroups during the 2015-2016 season. In Russia strains of the first group predominated. We registered an increased proportion of strains with D222G mutation in receptor-binding site. A herd immunity analysis carried out immediately prior to the epidemic showed that 34.4% blood sera samples collected in different regions of Russia were positive to A/California/07/09(H1N1)pdm09. We came to a conclusion that public awareness enhancement is necessary to reduce unreasonable refusals of vaccination.

Title: Lack of virological and serological evidence for continued circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus in wild birds in the Netherlands, 14 November 2014 to 31 January 2016.
Abstract: In 2014, H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage emerged in poultry and wild birds in Asia, Europe and North America. Here, wild birds were extensively investigated in the Netherlands for HPAI H5N8 virus (real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the matrix and H5 gene) and antibody detection (haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralisation assays) before, during and after the first virus detection in Europe in late 2014. Between 21 February 2015 and 31 January 2016, 7,337 bird samples were tested for the virus. One HPAI H5N8 virus-infected Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) sampled on 25 February 2015 was detected. Serological assays were performed on 1,443 samples, including 149 collected between 2007 and 2013, 945 between 14 November 2014 and 13 May 2015, and 349 between 1 September and 31 December 2015. Antibodies specific for HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 were absent in wild bird sera obtained before 2014 and present in sera collected during and after the HPAI H5N8 emergence in Europe, with antibody incidence declining after the 2014/15 winter. Our results indicate that the HPAI H5N8 virus has not continued to circulate extensively in wild bird populations since the 2014/15 winter and that independent maintenance of the virus in these populations appears unlikely.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and serological evidence of virus circulation without explicit analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Contamination-controlled high-throughput whole genome sequencing for influenza A viruses using the MiSeq sequencer.
Abstract: Accurate full-length genomic sequences are important for viral phylogenetic studies. We developed a targeted high-throughput whole genome sequencing (HT-WGS) method for influenza A viruses, which utilized an enzymatic cleavage-based approach, the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit, for library preparation. The entire library preparation workflow was adapted for the Sentosa SX101, a liquid handling platform, to automate this labor-intensive step. As the enzymatic cleavage-based approach generates low coverage reads at both ends of the cleaved products, we corrected this loss of sequencing coverage at the termini by introducing modified primers during the targeted amplification step to generate full-length influenza A sequences with even coverage across the whole genome. Another challenge of targeted HTS is the risk of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination during the library preparation step that results in the calling of false-positive minority variants. We included an in-run, negative system control to capture contamination reads that may be generated during the liquid handling procedures. The upper limits of 99.99% prediction intervals of the contamination rate were adopted as cut-off values of contamination reads. Here, 148 influenza A/H3N2 samples were sequenced using the HTS protocol and were compared against a Sanger-based sequencing method. Our data showed that the rate of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination was highly significant in HTS.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on sequencing methodology and contamination control without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Cell-Mediated Immunity Against Antigenically Drifted Influenza A(H3N2) Viruses in Children During a Vaccine Mismatch Season.
Abstract: Emergence of antigenically drifted influenza A(H3N2) viruses resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness in all age groups during the 2014-2015 influenza season. In children, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) elicited neutralizing antibodies (Abs) against drifted strains at significantly lower levels than against the vaccine strain. Little is known about the cross-reactivity of cell-mediated immunity against drifted strains in children. Children aged 3-17 years (n = 48) received IIV during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collected before (on day 0) and after (on days 7 and 21) vaccination were evaluated for induction of cross-reactive plasmablasts, memory B cells, and cytokine-secreting CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells against the vaccine and drifted A(H3N2) viruses by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay and flow cytometry. IIV increased frequencies of plasmablasts and memory B cells. The overall induction of the T-cell response was not significant. Both B-cell and T-cell responses showed significant cross-reactivity against A(H3N2) viruses. Age and preexisting immunity affected virus-specific plasmablast responses and fold-change of T-cell responses, respectively. The proportion of T-helper type 1-prone (ie, interferon γ- or tumor necrosis factor α-secreting) CD4(+) T cell responses also increased with age. In children aged 3-17 years, B- and T-cell responses following IIV receipt showed significant cross-reactivity against A(H3N2) viruses during a vaccine mismatch season.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on immune responses (B and T cell) in children to antigenically drifted influenza viruses, without explicit analysis of viral genotypes or direct genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination.
Abstract: Antigen-specific B cells bifurcate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B cells (MBCs) after infection or vaccination. ASCs (plasmablasts) have been extensively studied in humans, but less is known about B cells that become activated but do not differentiate into plasmablasts. Here we have defined the phenotype and transcriptional program of a subset of antigen-specific B cells, which we have called 'activated B cells' (ABCs), that were distinct from ASCs and were committed to the MBC lineage. We detected ABCs in humans after infection with Ebola virus or influenza virus and also after vaccination. By simultaneously analyzing antigen-specific ASCs and ABCs in human blood after vaccination against influenza virus, we investigated the clonal overlap and extent of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the ASC (effector) and ABC (memory) lineages. Longitudinal tracking of vaccination-induced hemagglutinin (HA)-specific clones revealed no overall increase in SHM over time, which suggested that repeated annual immunization might have limitations in enhancing the quality of influenza-virus-specific antibody.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study characterizes antigen-specific B cell subsets after infection or vaccination, focusing on host immune cell phenotypes without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Sustained live poultry market surveillance contributes to early warnings for human infection with avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Sporadic human infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N6) virus have been reported in different provinces in China since April 2014. From June 2015 to January 2016, routine live poultry market (LPM) surveillance was conducted in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. H5N6 viruses were not detected until November 2015. The H5N6 virus-positive rate increased markedly beginning in December 2015, and viruses were detected in LPMs in all districts of the city. Coincidently, two human cases with histories of poultry exposure developed symptoms and were diagnosed as H5N6-positive in Shenzhen during late December 2015 and early January 2016. Similar viruses were identified in environmental samples collected in the LPMs and the patients. In contrast to previously reported H5N6 viruses, viruses with six internal genes derived from the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses were detected in the present study. The increased H5N6 virus-positive rate in the LPMs and the subsequent human infections demonstrated that sustained LPM surveillance for avian influenza viruses provides an early warning for human infections. Interventions, such as LPM closures, should be immediately implemented to reduce the risk of human infection with the H5N6 virus when the virus is widely detected during LPM surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on surveillance and detection of H5N6 viruses and human infections, without explicit analysis linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Insights into the Usage of Nucleobase Triplets and Codon Context Pattern in Five Influenza A Virus Subtypes.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of negative polarity. Owing to the antigenic diversity and cross concrete shift, an immense number of novel strains have developed astronomically over the years. The present work deals with the codon utilization partialness among five different influenza A viruses isolated from human hosts. All the subtypes showed the homogeneous pattern of nucleotide utilization with a little variation in their utilization frequencies. A lower bias in codon utilization was observed in all the subtypes as reflected by higher magnitudes of an efficacious number of codons. Dinucleotide analysis showed very low CpG utilization and a high predilection of A/T-ending codons. The H5N1 subtype showed noticeable deviation from the rest. Codon pair context analysis showed remarkable depletion of NNC-GNN and NNT-ANN contexts. The findings alluded towards GC-compositional partialness playing a vital role, which is reflected in the consequential positive correlation between the GC contents at different codon positions. Untangling the codon utilization profile would significantly contribute to identifying novel drug targets that will pacify the search for antivirals against this virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes codon usage and nucleotide composition among influenza A subtypes but does not explicitly link these genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Clade-level Spatial Modelling of HPAI H5N1 Dynamics in the Mekong Region Reveals New Patterns and Associations with Agro-Ecological Factors.
Abstract: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been circulating in Asia since 2003 and diversified into several genetic lineages, or clades. Although the spatial distribution of its outbreaks was extensively studied, differences in clades were never previously taken into account. We developed models to quantify associations over time and space between different HPAI H5N1 viruses from clade 1, 2.3.4 and 2.3.2 and agro-ecological factors. We found that the distribution of clades in the Mekong region from 2004 to 2013 was strongly regionalised, defining specific epidemiological zones, or epizones. Clade 1 became entrenched in the Mekong Delta and was not supplanted by newer clades, in association with a relatively higher presence of domestic ducks. In contrast, two new clades were introduced (2.3.4 and 2.3.2) in northern Viet Nam and were associated with higher chicken density and more intensive chicken production systems. We suggest that differences in poultry production systems in these different epizones may explain these associations, along with differences in introduction pressure from neighbouring countries. The different distribution patterns found at the clade level would not be otherwise apparent through analysis treating all outbreaks equally, which requires improved linking of disease outbreak records and genetic sequence data.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study models spatial distribution of H5N1 clades and their association with agro-ecological factors but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Hospital surveillance of influenza strains: a concordant image of viruses identified by the Swiss Sentinel system?
Abstract: The Swiss Sentinel system for influenza virus surveillance reports influenza-like illness in the community through a network of primary care practitioners, but the epidemiologic, demographic, and virological characterization may differ from that observed in hospitalized patients with influenza. To compare demographic and virological data from hospital influenza cases with Sentinel system data during the 2014-2015 season. We included 2623 in- and outpatients with a screening request for influenza A/B in a university teaching hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, and 933 participants from the Swiss Sentinel surveillance system and compared the demographic and virological data of the two populations, including the respective distribution of influenza subtypes, and conducted a phylogenetic comparison at the HA1 level of influenza viruses recovered in community and hospital cases. There were similar proportions of influenza strains recovered in the hospital and in the community (H3N2, 57.1% and 56.9%; H1N1pdm09, 15.5% and 14.2%; B, 27.4% and 28.8%, respectively). HA1 sequence analysis confirmed that all three strains were genetically similar between the two populations. During this particular season, influenza cases were detected earlier in the hospital than in the Sentinel system. Although an influenza surveillance system based on the community can predict the type of influenza strains that will be associated with hospitalizations, it fails to estimate the potential virulence of circulating strains. Further, the population characteristics in the community differ from those in hospitalized patients. This suggests that any national influenza surveillance system should include both community- and hospital-based surveys.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study compares influenza strains in hospital and community settings and their genetic similarity but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Model-based clustering with certainty estimation: implication for clade assignment of influenza viruses.
Abstract: Clustering is a common technique used by molecular biologists to group homologous sequences and study evolution. There remain issues such as how to cluster molecular sequences accurately and in particular how to evaluate the certainty of clustering results. We presented a model-based clustering method to analyze molecular sequences, described a subset bootstrap scheme to evaluate a certainty of the clusters, and showed an intuitive way using 3D visualization to examine clusters. We applied the above approach to analyze influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. Nine clusters were estimated for high pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, which agree with previous findings. The certainty for a given sequence that can be correctly assigned to a cluster was all 1.0 whereas the certainty for a given cluster was also very high (0.92-1.0), with an overall clustering certainty of 0.95. For influenza A H7 viruses, ten HA clusters were estimated and the vast majority of sequences could be assigned to a cluster with a certainty of more than 0.99. The certainties for clusters, however, varied from 0.40 to 0.98; such certainty variation is likely attributed to the heterogeneity of sequence data in different clusters. In both cases, the certainty values estimated using the subset bootstrap method are all higher than those calculated based upon the standard bootstrap method, suggesting our bootstrap scheme is applicable for the estimation of clustering certainty. We formulated a clustering analysis approach with the estimation of certainties and 3D visualization of sequence data. We analysed 2 sets of influenza A HA sequences and the results indicate our approach was applicable for clustering analysis of influenza viral sequences.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on clustering of influenza viral sequences and certainty estimation without explicit links between genotype and phenotype.

Title: Intense circulation of A/H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses in Cambodian live-bird markets with serological evidence of sub-clinical human infections.
Abstract: Surveillance for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in poultry and environmental samples was conducted in four live-bird markets in Cambodia from January through November 2013. Through real-time RT-PCR testing, AIVs were detected in 45% of 1048 samples collected throughout the year. Detection rates ranged from 32% and 18% in duck and chicken swabs, respectively, to 75% in carcass wash water samples. Influenza A/H5N1 virus was detected in 79% of samples positive for influenza A virus and 35% of all samples collected. Sequence analysis of full-length haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from A/H5N1 viruses, and full-genome analysis of six representative isolates, revealed that the clade 1.1.2 reassortant virus associated with Cambodian human cases during 2013 was the only A/H5N1 virus detected during the year. However, multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HA and NA genes revealed co-circulation of at least nine low pathogenic AIVs from HA1, HA2, HA3, HA4, HA6, HA7, HA9, HA10 and HA11 subtypes. Four repeated serological surveys were conducted throughout the year in a cohort of 125 poultry workers. Serological testing found an overall prevalence of 4.5% and 1.8% for antibodies to A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Seroconversion rates of 3.7 and 0.9 cases per 1000 person-months participation were detected for A/H5N1 and A/H9N2, respectively. Peak AIV circulation was associated with the Lunar New Year festival. Knowledge of periods of increased circulation of avian influenza in markets should inform intervention measures such as market cleaning and closures to reduce risk of human infections and emergence of novel AIVs.

Title: Evidence for wild waterfowl origin of H7N3 influenza A virus detected in captive-reared New Jersey pheasants.
Abstract: In August 2014, a low-pathogenic H7N3 influenza A virus was isolated from pheasants at a New Jersey gamebird farm and hunting preserve. In this study, we use phylogenetic analyses and calculations of genetic similarity to gain inference into the genetic ancestry of this virus and to identify potential routes of transmission. Results of maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-clade-credibility (MCC) phylogenetic analyses provide evidence that A/pheasant/New Jersey/26996-2/2014 (H7N3) had closely related H7 hemagglutinin (HA) and N3 neuraminidase (NA) gene segments as compared to influenza A viruses circulating among wild waterfowl in the central and eastern USA. The estimated time of the most recent common ancestry (TMRCA) between the pheasant virus and those most closely related from wild waterfowl was early 2013 for both the H7 HA and N3 NA gene segments. None of the viruses from waterfowl identified as being most closely related to A/pheasant/New Jersey/26996-2/2014 at the HA and NA gene segments in ML and MCC phylogenetic analyses shared ≥99 % nucleotide sequence identity for internal gene segment sequences. This result indicates that specific viral strains identified in this study as being closely related to the HA and NA gene segments of A/pheasant/New Jersey/26996-2/2014 were not the direct predecessors of the etiological agent identified during the New Jersey outbreak. However, the recent common ancestry of the H7 and N3 gene segments of waterfowl-origin viruses and the virus isolated from pheasants suggests that viral diversity maintained in wild waterfowl likely played an important role in the emergence of A/pheasant/New Jersey/26996-2/2014.

Title: Origins of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in swine in Mexico.
Abstract: Asia is considered an important source of influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics, owing to large, diverse viral reservoirs in poultry and swine. However, the zoonotic origins of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) remain unclear, due to conflicting evidence from swine and humans. There is strong evidence that the first human outbreak of pdmH1N1 occurred in Mexico in early 2009. However, no related swine viruses have been detected in Mexico or any part of the Americas, and to date the most closely related ancestor viruses were identified in Asian swine. Here, we use 58 new whole-genome sequences from IAVs collected in Mexican swine to establish that the swine virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic evolved in central Mexico. This finding highlights how the 2009 pandemic arose from a region not considered a pandemic risk, owing to an expansion of IAV diversity in swine resulting from long-distance live swine trade.
Relevant: False

Title: Prevalence and diversity of H9N2 avian influenza in chickens of Northern Vietnam, 2014.
Abstract: Despite their classification as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), A/H9N2 viruses cause significant losses in poultry in many countries throughout Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on detection of influenza H5 viruses, and there is limited understanding of influenza H9 epidemiology and transmission dynamics. We determined prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) of 7 northern Vietnamese provinces, using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real time RT-PCR revealed 1207/4900 (24.6%) of pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct<26. No influenza H7 was detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence was of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 whole genomes of A/H9N2, 2 of A/H5N6, and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98%, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of H9 viruses to northern Vietnam rather than in-situ transmission. Further investigations of H9 prevalence and diversity in other regions of Vietnam are warranted to assess H9 endemicity elsewhere in the country.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports prevalence and genetic diversity of H9N2 viruses and identifies genotypes but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Whole-genome analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in Uganda from 2009 to 2011.
Abstract: We report a whole-genome analysis of 19 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates from four Ugandan hospitals between 2009 and 2011. The isolates differed from the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 by three amino acid substitutions P100S, S220T, and I338V in the hemagglutinin and by two amino acid substitutions V106I and N248D in the neuraminidase proteins with consistent mutations in all gene segments distinguishing isolates from the 2009/2010 to 2010/2011 seasons. Phylogenetic analysis showed low genetic evolution, with genetic distances of 0%-1.3% and 0.1%-1.6% for HA and NA genes, respectively.

Title: Spring Migration Stopover Ecology of Avian Influenza Virus Shorebird Hosts at Delaware Bay.
Abstract: Although low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) are detected in shorebirds at Delaware Bay annually, little is known about affected species habitat preferences or the movement patterns that might influence virus transmission and spread. During the 5-wk spring migration stopover period during 2007-2008, we conducted a radiotelemetry study of often-infected ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres morinella; n = 60) and rarely infected sanderlings (Calidris alba; n = 20) to identify locations and habitats important to these species (during daytime and nighttime), determine the extent of overlap with other AIV reservoir species or poultry production areas, reveal possible movements of AIV around the Bay, and assess whether long-distance movement of AIV is likely after shorebird departure. Ruddy turnstones and sanderlings both fed on Bay beaches during the daytime. However, sanderlings used remote sandy points and islands during the nighttime while ruddy turnstones primarily used salt marsh harboring waterfowl and gull breeding colonies, suggesting that this environment supports AIV circulation. Shorebird locations were farther from agricultural land and poultry operations than were random locations, suggesting selection away from poultry. Further, there was no areal overlap between shorebird home ranges and poultry production areas. Only 37% (22/60) of ruddy turnstones crossed into Delaware from capture sites in New Jersey, suggesting partial site fidelity and AIV gene pool separation between the states. Ruddy turnstones departed en masse around June 1 when AIV prevalence was low or declining, suggesting that a limited number of birds could disperse AIV onto the breeding grounds. This study provides needed insight into AIV and migratory host ecology, and results can inform both domestic animal AIV prevention and shorebird conservation efforts.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on ecological and behavioral aspects of avian influenza virus hosts without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A Viruses from Overwintering and Spring-Migrating Waterfowl in the Lake Erie Basin, United States.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance in migratory waterfowl in the United States has primarily occurred during late summer and the autumn southern migration. Data concerning the presence and ecology of IAVs in waterfowl during winter and spring seasons in the U.S. northern latitudes have been limited, mainly due to limited access to waterfowl for sampling. The southwestern Lake Erie Basin is an important stopover site for waterfowl during migration periods, and over the past 28 years, 8.72% of waterfowl sampled in this geographic location have been positive for IAV recovery during summer and autumn (June-December). To gain a better understanding of influenza A viral dynamics in waterfowl populations during winter and spring migration (February through April), cloacal swabs were collected from overwintering and spring-migrating waterfowl in Ohio and Michigan in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2014. A total of 740 cloacal swabs were collected and tested using virus isolation in embryonating chicken eggs, resulting in the recovery of 33 (4.5%) IAV isolates. The influenza A isolates were recovered from eight waterfowl species in the order Anseriformes. Antigenically, the IAV isolates represent 15 distinct hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) combinations, with seven (21%) of the isolates reported as mixed infections based on antigenic HA subtyping, NA subtyping, or both. This effort demonstrates the presence of antigenically diverse IAV in waterfowl during overwintering and spring migration at northern latitudes in the United States, thereby contributing to the understanding of the maintenance of diversity among waterfowl-origin IAVs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports antigenic diversity and subtype combinations of influenza A viruses in waterfowl but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Influenza Activity - United States, 2015-16 Season and Composition of the 2016-17 Influenza Vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2015-16 influenza season (October 4, 2015-May 21, 2016) in the United States, influenza activity* was lower and peaked later compared with the previous three seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15). Activity remained low from October 2015 until late December 2015 and peaked in mid-March 2016. During the most recent 18 influenza seasons (including this season), only two other seasons have peaked in March (2011-12 and 2005-06). Overall influenza activity was moderate this season, with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI),(†) lower hospitalization rates, and a lower percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared with the preceding three seasons. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated overall, but influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly identified from October to early December, and influenza B viruses were more commonly identified from mid-April through mid-May. The majority of viruses characterized this season were antigenically similar to the reference viruses representing the recommended components of the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (1). This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2015-16 influenza season (October 4, 2015-May 21, 2016)(§) and reports the vaccine virus components recommended for the 2016-17 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Title: The His131Arg substitution in the FCGR2A gene (rs1801274) is not associated with the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.
Abstract: The virulence and pathogenicity of different influenza strains are responsible for a more or less severe disease. Recent studies have attempted to understand how host genetic factors may influence the clinical presentation of the disease. In the present study, the His131Arg (rs1801274) polymorphism was investigated in individuals from a Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. In the present study, the influence of the His131Arg (rs1801274) polymorphism, a variant of the FCGR2A gene, was investigated in 436 patients with a diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010. Patients were divided into a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 192) and a group of hospitalized patients (n = 244; 100 of them died). No significant difference in the allele or genotype frequencies of the rs1801274 polymorphism was observed between groups (p = 0.952 and p = 0.388). Multinomial logistic regression showed no effect of the rs1801274 polymorphism on severity or death of patients from the Brazilian admixed population (p = 0.368 and p = 0.469). The rs1801274 polymorphism is not associated with severe disease in patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates a host genetic polymorphism and its association with disease severity but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Statistical inference of a convergent antibody repertoire response to influenza vaccine.
Abstract: Vaccines dramatically affect an individual's adaptive immune system and thus provide an excellent means to study human immunity. Upon vaccination, the B cells that express antibodies (Abs) that happen to bind the vaccine are stimulated to proliferate and undergo mutagenesis at their Ab locus. This process may alter the composition of B cell lineages within an individual, which are known collectively as the antibody repertoire (AbR). Antibodies are also highly expressed in whole blood, potentially enabling RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies to query this diversity. Less is known about the diversity of AbR responses across individuals to a given vaccine and if individuals tend to yield a similar response to the same antigenic stimulus. Here we implement a bioinformatic pipeline that extracts the AbR information from a time-series RNA-seq dataset of five patients who were administered a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). We harness the detailed time-series nature of this dataset and use methods based in functional data analysis (FDA) to identify the Abs that respond to the vaccine. We then design and implement rigorous statistical tests in order to ask whether or not these patients exhibit a convergent AbR response to the same TIV. We find that high-resolution time-series data can be used to help identify the Abs that respond to an antigenic stimulus and that this response can exhibit a convergent nature across patients inoculated with the same vaccine. However, correlations in AbR diversity among individuals prior to inoculation can confound inference of a convergent signal unless it is taken into account. We developed a framework to identify the elements of an AbR that respond to an antigen. This information could be used to understand the diversity of different immune responses in different individuals, as well as to gauge the effectiveness of the immune response to a given stimulus within an individual. We also present a framework for testing a convergent hypothesis between AbRs; a hypothesis that is more difficult to test than previously appreciated. Our discovery of a convergent signal suggests that similar epitopes do select for antibodies with similar sequence characteristics.

Reason: This paper focuses on antibody repertoire responses to vaccination and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Role of Punctuated Evolution in the Pathogenicity of Influenza Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. Evolutionarily, all influenza viruses are zoonoses, arising in the animal reservoir and spilling over into the human population. Several times a century, one of these zoonotic events results in a new influenza virus lineage becoming established in humans and circulating for years or decades as an endemic strain. The worldwide pandemic that occurs shortly after the nascent virus becomes established can have a profound impact on morbidity and mortality. Because influenza viruses continually evolve and the illness they engender can vary considerably based on characteristics of the strain, the weather, other circulating or endemic pathogens, as well as the number of susceptible hosts, the impact of each season on human health is unpredictable. Over time, the general pattern is for pandemic strains to adapt and gradually take on characteristics of seasonal strains with lower virulence and a diminished synergism with bacterial pathogens. Study of this punctuated evolution yields a number of insights into the overall pathogenicity of influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus evolution and pathogenicity broadly without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: A cross-immunization model for the extinction of old influenza strains.
Abstract: Given the frequent mutation of antigenic features, the constancy of genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza within a subtype is surprising. While the emergence of new strains and antigenic features is commonly attributed to selection by the human immune system, the mechanism that ensures the extinction of older strains remains controversial. To replicate this dynamics of replacement current models utilize mechanisms such as short-lived strain-transcending immunity, a direct competition for hosts, stochastic extinction or constrained antigenic evolution. Building on the idea of short-lived immunity we introduce a minimal model that exhibits the aforementioned dynamics of replacement. Our model relies only on competition due to an antigen specific immune-response in an unconstrained antigenic space. Furthermore the model explains the size of typical influenza epidemics as well as the tendency that new epidemics are associated with mutations of old antigens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This modeling study focuses on antigenic and epidemiological dynamics of influenza strains without direct experimental linkage of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fatal influenza A (H5N1) virus Infection in zoo-housed Tigers in Yunnan Province, China.
Abstract: From 2014 to 2015, three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza infection occurred in zoo-housed north-east China tigers (Panthera tigris ssp.altaica) and four tigers died of respiratory distress in succession in Yunnan Province, China. We isolated and characterized three highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses from these tigers. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that A/tiger /Yunnan /tig1404 /2014(H5N1) belongs to the provisional subclade 2.3.4.4e which were novel reassortant influenza A (H5N1) viruses with six internal genes from avian influenza A (H5N2) viruses. The HA gene of the isolated A/tiger /Yunnan /tig1412 /2014(H5N1) virus belongs to the subclade 2.3.2.1b. The isolated A/tiger /Yunnan /tig1508/2015 (H5N1) virus was a novel reassortant influenza A (H5N1) virus with three internal genes (PB2, PB1 and M) from H9N2 virus and belongs to the subclade 2.3.2.1c.

Title: Exploiting Genetic Interference for Antiviral Therapy.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving viruses are a major threat to human health. Such viruses are often highly pathogenic (e.g., influenza virus, HIV, Ebola virus) and routinely circumvent therapeutic intervention through mutational escape. Error-prone genome replication generates heterogeneous viral populations that rapidly adapt to new selection pressures, leading to resistance that emerges with treatment. However, population heterogeneity bears a cost: when multiple viral variants replicate within a cell, they can potentially interfere with each other, lowering viral fitness. This genetic interference can be exploited for antiviral strategies, either by taking advantage of a virus's inherent genetic diversity or through generating de novo interference by engineering a competing genome. Here, we discuss two such antiviral strategies, dominant drug targeting and therapeutic interfering particles. Both strategies harness the power of genetic interference to surmount two particularly vexing obstacles-the evolution of drug resistance and targeting therapy to high-risk populations-both of which impede treatment in resource-poor settings.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a conceptual review discussing genetic interference as an antiviral strategy without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: RNA-Free and Ribonucleoprotein-Associated Influenza Virus Polymerases Directly Bind the Serine-5-Phosphorylated Carboxyl-Terminal Domain of Host RNA Polymerase II.
Abstract: Influenza viruses subvert the transcriptional machinery of their hosts to synthesize their own viral mRNA. Ongoing transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is required for viral mRNA synthesis. By a process known as cap snatching, the virus steals short 5' capped RNA fragments from host capped RNAs and uses them to prime viral transcription. An interaction between the influenza A virus RNA polymerase and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of Pol II has been established, but the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. We show here that the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex binds to the CTD of transcriptionally engaged Pol II. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the viral polymerase binds directly to the serine-5-phosphorylated form of the Pol II CTD, both in the presence and in the absence of viral RNA, and show that this interaction is conserved in evolutionarily distant influenza viruses. We propose a model in which direct binding of the viral RNA polymerase in the context of vRNPs to Pol II early in infection facilitates cap snatching, while we suggest that binding of free viral polymerase to Pol II late in infection may trigger Pol II degradation. Influenza viruses cause yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics that pose a threat to human health, as well as represent a large economic burden to health care systems globally. Existing vaccines are not always effective, as they may not exactly match the circulating viruses. Furthermore, there are a limited number of antivirals available, and development of resistance to these is a concern. New measures to combat influenza are needed, but before they can be developed, it is necessary to better understand the molecular interactions between influenza viruses and their host cells. By providing further insights into the molecular details of how influenza viruses hijack the host transcriptional machinery, we aim to uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on molecular interactions between influenza polymerase and host RNA polymerase II without explicit links between viral genotype variations and phenotypic traits.

Title: Crystal structure of the drug-resistant S31N influenza M2 proton channel.
Abstract: The M2 protein is a small proton channel found in the influenza A virus that is necessary for viral replication. The M2 channel is the target of a class of drugs called the adamantanes, which block the channel pore and prevent the virus from replicating. In recent decades mutations have arisen in M2 that prevent the adamantanes from binding to the channel pore, with the most prevalent of these mutations being S31N. Here we report the first crystal structure of the S31N mutant crystallized using lipidic cubic phase crystallization techniques and solved to 1.59 Å resolution. The Asn31 residues point directly into the center of the channel pore and form a hydrogen-bonded network that disrupts the drug-binding site. Ordered waters in the channel pore form a continuous hydrogen bonding network from Gly34 to His37.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a structural biology study describing the crystal structure of a drug-resistant M2 mutant without explicit links to phenotypic traits like virulence or transmissibility.

Title: Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in primary care in the United Kingdom: 2015/16 mid-season results.
Abstract: In 2015/16, the influenza season in the United Kingdom was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation. Virus characterisation indicated the emergence of genetic clusters, with the majority antigenically similar to the current influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain. Mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates show an adjusted VE of 41.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-64.7) against influenza-confirmed primary care consultations and of 49.1% (95% CI: 9.3-71.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These estimates show levels of protection similar to the 2010/11 season, when this strain was first used in the seasonal vaccine.

Title: Two Outbreak Sources of Influenza A (H7N9) Viruses Have Been Established in China.
Abstract: Due to enzootic infections in poultry and persistent human infections in China, influenza A (H7N9) virus has remained a public health threat. The Yangtze River Delta region, which is located in eastern China, is well recognized as the original source for H7N9 outbreaks. Based on the evolutionary analysis of H7N9 viruses from all three outbreak waves since 2013, we identified the Pearl River Delta region as an additional H7N9 outbreak source. H7N9 viruses are repeatedly introduced from these two sources to the other areas, and the persistent circulation of H7N9 viruses occurs in poultry, causing continuous outbreak waves. Poultry movements may contribute to the geographic expansion of the virus. In addition, the AnH1 genotype, which was predominant during wave 1, was replaced by JS537, JS18828, and AnH1887 genotypes during waves 2 and 3. The establishment of a new source and the continuous evolution of the virus hamper the elimination of H7N9 viruses, thus posing a long-term threat of H7N9 infection in humans. Therefore, both surveillance of H7N9 viruses in humans and poultry and supervision of poultry movements should be strengthened. Since its occurrence in humans in eastern China in spring 2013, the avian H7N9 viruses have been demonstrating the continuing pandemic threat posed by the current influenza ecosystem in China. As the viruses are silently circulated in poultry, with potentially severe outcomes in humans, H7N9 virus activity in humans in China is very important to understand. In this study, we identified a newly emerged H7N9 outbreak source in the Pearl River Delta region. Both sources in the Yangtze River Delta region and the Pearl River Delta region have been established and found to be responsible for the H7N9 outbreaks in mainland China.

Abstract: H3N2 canine influenza virus emerged in South Korea in 2007 and subsequently spread to China and Thailand, causing epidemic or endemic respiratory diseases in dogs. Through intermammalian species transmission, the virus has also infected cats. However, no direct evidence of significant genetic evolution has been reported since its first emergence. Here, we describe in depth the genetic and molecular characteristics of the ancestral strain (i.e., the first virus isolate from South Korea) of the H3N2 canine influenza virus currently circulating in East Asia.

Title: Genetically Diverse Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza A Virus Subtypes Co-Circulate among Poultry in Bangladesh.
Abstract: Influenza virus surveillance, poultry outbreak investigations and genomic sequencing were assessed to understand the ecology and evolution of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2013. We analyzed 506 avian specimens collected from poultry in live bird markets and backyard flocks to identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation-positive specimens (n = 50) were subtyped and their coding-complete genomes were sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H9N2, H11N3, H4N6, and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or northern Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed over several geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number of viral subtypes suggesting extensive reassortment among these LPAI viruses. H9N2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes because genes from these viruses consistently clustered together, indicating this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses detected in Bangladesh representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, the circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were both phylogenetically and antigenically unrelated to H5 viruses identified previously in humans in Bangladesh and H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic poultry sold in live bird markets carried a wide range of LPAI virus subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes. These findings, combined with the seven year timeframe of sampling, indicate a continuous circulation of these viruses in the country.

Title: Prevalence of avian respiratory viruses in broiler flocks in Egypt.
Abstract: In this study, respiratory viral pathogens were screened using real-time RT-PCR in 86 broiler chicken flocks suffering from respiratory diseases problems in 4 Egyptian governorates between January 2012 and February 2014. The mortality rates in the investigated flocks ranged from 1 to 47%. Results showed that mixed infection represented 66.3% of the examined flocks. Mixed infectious bronchitis (IBV) and avian influenza (AI)-H9N2 viruses were the most common infection (41.7%). Lack of AI-H9N2 vaccination and high rates of mixed infections in which AI-H9N2 is involved indicate an early AI-H9N2 infection with a potential immunosuppressive effect that predisposes for other viral infections. High pathogenic AI-H5N1 and virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) infections were also detected (26.7% and 8.1%, respectively). Interestingly, co-infection of AI-H9N2 with either AIV-H5N1 or vNDV rarely resulted in high mortality. Partial cell-mediated immunity against similar internal AI genes, as well as virus interference between AI and vNDV, could be an explanation for this. Highly prevalent IBV and AI-H9N2 were isolated and were molecularly characterized based on S1 gene hypervariable region 3 ( HVR3: ) and hemagglutinin gene (HA) sequences, respectively. IBV strains were related to the variant group of IBV with multiple mutations in HVR3. Though AI-H9N2 viruses showed low rate of evolution in comparison to recent strains, few amino acid substitutions indicative of antibody selection pressure were observed in the HA gene. In conclusion, mixed viral infections, especially with IBV and AI-H9N2 viruses, are the predominant etiology of respiratory disease problems in broiler chickens in Egypt. Further investigations of the role of AI, IBV, and ND viruses' co-infections and interference in terms of altering the severity of clinical signs and lesions and/or generating novel reassortants within each virus are needed.

Title: Antigenic Drift of A/H3N2/Virus and Circulation of Influenza-Like Viruses During the 2014/2015 Influenza Season in Poland.
Abstract: Morbidity rates of influenza could be greatly reduced due to vaccination. However, the virus is able to evolve through genetic mutations, which is why vaccines with updated composition are necessary every season. Their effectiveness depends on whether there is a good antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. In Poland, the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic started in week 5 (January/February) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (April) of 2015. The influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influence-like illness at week 10/2015 (March). During that season, antigenic drift of influenza virus A/H3N2/ occurred causing higher rates of A/H3N2/ infections. Among the 2416 tested specimens, 22.6 % of influenza cases were positive for A/H3N2/, while A/H1N1/pdm09 constituted 14.6 % cases. Influenza A viruses were detected in co-circulation with influenza B viruses; the latter amounted to 34.1 % of all influenza detections. Other detected causes of influenza-like illness consisted of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), being predominant, and, sporadically, human coronavirus, parainfluenza 1-3, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. Despite low vaccine effectiveness of solely one component, A/H3N2/, the vaccine could mitigate or shorten the length of influenza infection and reduce the number of severe outcomes and mortality. Thus, vaccination against influenza remains the most effective way to prevent illness and possibly fatal outcomes.

Title: A "building block" approach to the new influenza A virus entry inhibitors with reduced cellular toxicities.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a severe worldwide threat to public health and economic development that results in the emergence of drug-resistant or highly virulent strains. Therefore, it is imperative to develop potent anti-IAV drugs with different modes of action to currently available drugs. Herein, we show a new class of antiviral peptides generated by conjugating two known short antiviral peptides: part-1 (named Jp with the sequence of ARLPR) and part-2 (named Hp with the sequence of KKWK). The new peptides were thus created by hybridization of these two domains at C- and N- termini, respectively. The anti-IAV screening results identified that C20-Jp-Hp was the most potent peptide with IC50 value of 0.53 μM against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) strain. Interestingly, these new peptides display lower toxicities toward mammalian cells and higher therapeutic indices than their prototypes. In addition, the mechanism of action of C20-Jp-Hp was extensively investigated.

Title: Tissue factor deficiency increases alveolar hemorrhage and death in influenza A virus-infected mice.
Abstract: Essentials H1N1 Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a hemostatic challenge for the lung. Tissue factor (TF) on lung epithelial cells maintains lung hemostasis after IAV infection. Reduced TF-dependent activation of coagulation leads to alveolar hemorrhage. Anticoagulation might increase the risk for hemorrhages into the lung during severe IAV infection. Background Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a common respiratory tract infection that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objective To investigate the effect of genetic deficiency of tissue factor (TF) in a mouse model of IAV infection. Methods Wild-type mice, low-TF (LTF) mice and mice with the TF gene deleted in different cell types were infected with a mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 strain of IAV. TF expression was measured in the lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to measure extracellular vesicle TF, activation of coagulation, alveolar hemorrhage, and inflammation. Results IAV infection of wild-type mice increased lung TF expression, activation of coagulation and inflammation in BALF, but also led to alveolar hemorrhage. LTF mice and mice with selective deficiency of TF in lung epithelial cells had low basal levels of TF and failed to increase TF expression after infection; these two strains of mice had more alveolar hemorrhage and death than controls. In contrast, deletion of TF in either myeloid cells or endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells did not increase alveolar hemorrhage or death after IAV infection. These results indicate that TF expression in the lung, particularly in epithelial cells, is required to maintain alveolar hemostasis after IAV infection. Conclusion Our study indicates that TF-dependent activation of coagulation is required to limit alveolar hemorrhage and death after IAV infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of tissue factor in host response to influenza infection in mice, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Emergence and development of H7N9 influenza viruses in China.
Abstract: The occurrence of human infections with avian H7N9 viruses since 2013 demonstrates the continuing pandemic threat posed by the current influenza ecosystem in China. Influenza surveillance and phylogenetic analyses showed that these viruses were generated by multiple interspecies transmissions and reassortments among the viruses resident in domestic ducks and the H9N2 viruses enzootic in chickens. A large population of domestic ducks hosting diverse influenza viruses provided the precondition for these events to occur, while acquiring internal genes from enzootic H9N2 influenza viruses in chickens promoted the spread of these viruses. Human infections effectively act as sentinels, reflecting the intensity of the activity of these viruses in poultry.

Title: Genotyping Influenza Virus by Next-Generation Deep Sequencing in Clinical Specimens.
Abstract: Rapid and accurate identification of an influenza outbreak is essential for patient care and treatment. We describe a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based, unbiased deep sequencing method in clinical specimens to investigate an influenza outbreak. Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients were collected for molecular epidemiological analysis. Total RNA was sequenced by using the NGS technology as paired-end 250 bp reads. Total of 7 to 12 million reads were obtained. After mapping to the human reference genome, we analyzed the 3-4% of reads that originated from a non-human source. A BLAST search of the contigs reconstructed de novo revealed high sequence similarity with that of the pandemic H1N1 virus. In the phylogenetic analysis, the HA gene of our samples clustered closely with that of A/Senegal/VR785/2010(H1N1), A/Wisconsin/11/2013(H1N1), and A/Korea/01/2009(H1N1), and the NA gene of our samples clustered closely with A/Wisconsin/11/2013(H1N1). This study suggests that NGS-based unbiased sequencing can be effectively applied to investigate molecular characteristics of nosocomial influenza outbreak by using clinical specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs.

Title: Cross-reactivity between avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and divergent H7 subtypic- and heterosubtypic influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The number of human avian H7N9 influenza infections has been increasing in China. Understanding their antigenic and serologic relationships is crucial for developing diagnostic tools and vaccines. Here, we evaluated the cross-reactivities and neutralizing activities among H7 subtype influenza viruses and between H7N9 and heterosubtype influenza A viruses. We found strong cross-reactivities between H7N9 and divergent H7 subtypic viruses, including H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7. Antisera against H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7 could also effectively neutralize two distinct H7N9 strains. Two-way cross-reactivities exist within group 2, including H3 and H4, whereas one-way cross-reactivities were found across other groups, including H1, H10, H9, and H13. Our data indicate that the hemaglutinins from divergent H7 subtypes may facilitate the development of vaccines for distinct H7N9 infections. Moreover, serologic diagnoses for H7N9 infections need to consider possible interference from the cross-reactivity of H7N9 with other subtype influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on serologic cross-reactivity among influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: Influenza Activity--United States, October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016.
Abstract: From October through mid-December 2015, influenza activity remained low in most regions of the United States. Activity began to increase in late December 2015 and continued to increase slowly through early February 2016. Influenza A viruses have been most frequently identified, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating during October until early December, and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating from mid-December until early February. Most of the influenza viruses characterized during that time are antigenically similar to vaccine virus strains recommended for inclusion in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 4, 2015-February 6, 2016, and updates the previous summary (1).

Title: Host immunity and pathogen diversity: A computational study.
Abstract: The distinctive features of human influenza A phylogeny have inspired many mathematical and computational studies of viral infections spreading in a host population, but our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the coupled evolution of host immunity, disease incidence and viral antigenic properties is far from complete. In this paper we explore the epidemiology and the phylogeny of a rapidly mutating pathogen in a host population with a weak immune response, that allows re-infection by the same strain and provides little cross-immunity. We find that mutation generates explosive diversity and that, as diversity grows, the system is driven to a very high prevalence level. This is in stark contrast with the behavior of similar models where mutation gives rise to a large epidemic followed by disease extinction, under the assumption that infection with a strain provides lifelong immunity. For low mutation rates, the behavior of the system shows the main qualitative features of influenza evolution. Our results highlight the importance of heterogeneity in the human immune response for understanding influenza A phenomenology. They are meant as a first step toward computationally affordable, individual based models including more complex host-pathogen interactions.

Reason: This is a computational modeling study of host immunity and viral diversity without explicit experimental or observational links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Serological evidence of H9N2 avian influenza virus exposure among poultry workers from Fars province of Iran.
Abstract: Since the 1990s, influenza A viruses of the H9N2 subtype have been causing infections in the poultry population around the globe. This influenza subtype is widely circulating in poultry and human cases of AI H9N2 have been sporadically reported in countries where this virus is endemic in domestic birds. The wide circulation of H9N2 viruses throughout Europe and Asia along with their ability to cause direct infection in mammals and humans, raises public health concerns. H9N2 AI was reported for the first time in Iran in 1998 and at present it is endemic in poultry. This study was carried out to evaluate the exposure to H9N2 AI viruses among poultry workers from the Fars province. 100 poultry workers and 100 healthy individuals with no professional exposure to poultry took part in this study. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against two distinct H9N2 avian influenza viruses, which showed different phylogenetic clustering and important molecular differences, such as at the amino acid (aa) position 226 (Q/L) (H3 numbering), using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. Results showed that 17 % of the poultry workers were positive for the A/chicken/Iran/10VIR/854-5/2008 virus in MN test and 12 % in HI test using the titer ≥40 as positive cut-off value. Only 2 % of the poultry workers were positive for the A/chicken/Iran/12VIR/9630/1998 virus. Seroprevalence of non exposed individuals for both H9N2 strains was below 3 % by both tests. Statistical analyses models showed that exposure to poultry significantly increases the risk of infection with H9N2 virus. The results have demonstrated that exposure to avian H9N2 viruses had occurred among poultry workers in the Fars province of Iran. Continuous surveillance programmes should be implemented to monitor the presence of avian influenza infections in humans and to evaluate their potential threat to poultry workers and public health.

Reason: This is a seroepidemiological study assessing exposure to H9N2 viruses; it does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Genetic Diversity of Influenza A Viruses in Wild Birds in Peru.
Abstract: Our understanding of the global ecology of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) is impeded by historically low levels of viral surveillance in Latin America. Through sampling and whole-genome sequencing of 31 AIVs from wild birds in Peru, we identified 10 HA subtypes (H1-H4, H6-H7, H10-H13) and 8 NA subtypes (N1-N3, N5-N9). The majority of Peruvian AIVs were closely related to AIVs found in North America. However, unusual reassortants, including a H13 virus containing a PA segment related to extremely divergent Argentinian viruses, suggest that substantial AIV diversity circulates undetected throughout South America.
Relevant: False

Title: Influenza viruses received and tested by the Melbourne WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza annual report, 2014.
Abstract: The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne is part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In 2014 the Centre received a total of 5,374 influenza samples from laboratories primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Viruses were characterised by their antigenic, genetic and antiviral drug resistance properties. Of the viruses successfully analysed 52% were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The majority of these were antigenically and genetically similar to the WHO recommended reference strain for the 2014 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Results for A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses suggested that circulating viruses of this subtype and lineage, respectively, had undergone antigenic and/or genetic changes, consistent with the decision by WHO to change recommended strains for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. A small number of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses had highly reduced inhibition to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The Centre also undertook primary isolation of vaccine candidate viruses directly into eggs. A total of 38 viruses were successfully isolated in eggs, of which 1 (B/Phuket/3073/2013) was included in the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: Discovery of Influenza A Virus Sequence Pairs and Their Combinations for Simultaneous Heterosubtypic Targeting that Hedge against Antiviral Resistance.
Abstract: The multiple circulating human influenza A virus subtypes coupled with the perpetual genomic mutations and segment reassortment events challenge the development of effective therapeutics. The capacity to drug most RNAs motivates the investigation on viral RNA targets. 123,060 segment sequences from 35,938 strains of the most prevalent subtypes also infecting humans-H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9, were used to identify 1,183 conserved RNA target sequences (≥15-mer) in the internal segments. 100% theoretical coverage in simultaneous heterosubtypic targeting is achieved by pairing specific sequences from the same segment ("Duals") or from two segments ("Doubles"); 1,662 Duals and 28,463 Doubles identified. By combining specific Duals and/or Doubles to form a target graph wherein an edge connecting two vertices (target sequences) represents a Dual or Double, it is possible to hedge against antiviral resistance besides maintaining 100% heterosubtypic coverage. To evaluate the hedging potential, we define the hedge-factor as the minimum number of resistant target sequences that will render the graph to become resistant i.e. eliminate all the edges therein; a target sequence or a graph is considered resistant when it cannot achieve 100% heterosubtypic coverage. In an n-vertices graph (n ≥ 3), the hedge-factor is maximal (= n- 1) when it is a complete graph i.e. every distinct pair in a graph is either a Dual or Double. Computational analyses uncover an extensive number of complete graphs of different sizes. Monte Carlo simulations show that the mutation counts and time elapsed for a target graph to become resistant increase with the hedge-factor. Incidentally, target sequences which were reported to reduce virus titre in experiments are included in our target graphs. The identity of target sequence pairs for heterosubtypic targeting and their combinations for hedging antiviral resistance are useful toolkits to construct target graphs for different therapeutic objectives.

Reason: This is a computational study identifying conserved RNA target sequences for antiviral targeting, without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Uncovering the Potential Pan Proteomes Encoded by Genomic Strand RNAs of Influenza A Viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A virus genomes are composed of eight negative sense RNAs. In total, 16 proteins encoded by eight positive sense RNAs were identified. One putative protein coding sequence (PCS) encoded by genomic strand RNA of segment 8 has been previously proposed. In this study, 95,608, 123,965 and 35,699 genomic strand RNA sequences from influenza A viruses from avian, human and mammalian hosts, respectively, were used to identify PCSs encoded by the genomic strand RNAs. In total, 326,069 PCSs with lengths equal to or longer than 80 amino acids were identified and clustered into 270 PCS groups. Twenty of the 270 PCS groups which have greater than 10% proportion in influenza A viruses from avian, human or mammalian hosts were selected for detailed study. Maps of the 20 PCSGs in the influenza A virus genomes were constructed. The proportions of the 20 PCSGs in influenza A viruses from different hosts and serotypes were analyzed. One secretory and five membrane proteins predicted from the PCS groups encoded by genomic strand RNAs of segments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 were identified. These results suggest the possibility of the ambisense nature of the influenza A virus genomic RNAs and a potential coding sequence reservoir encoding potential pan proteomes of influenza A viruses.

Title: [Development of a real-time RT-PCR for detection of equine influenza virus].
Abstract: Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease in horses caused by influenza A viruses. In this work a real-time RT-PCR for fast and sensitive diagnosis of equine influenza viruses (EIV) targeting a highly conserved region of the matrix gene was developed. In addition two RT-PCR methods for the amplification of large parts of the matrix- and HA gene were adapted for molecular-epidemiological characterization of viruses. The primers of the real-time RT-PCR had homologies of 99.4% to EIV- and 97.7% to all influenza A viral sequences, whereas the minor groove binder (MGB) probe showed homologies of 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. These high values allow application of the assay for influenza viruses in other species. Using 20 equine, 11 porcine and 2 avian samples, diagnostic suitability of the assay was confirmed. High specificity for influenza viruses was shown both experimentally and by software simulation. The assay analytical sensitivity was at 10(2)-10(3) copies of RNA and 10(0)-10(1) copies of DNA, respectively. This allows virus detection also in circumstances of minor viral shedding. All amplified EIV sequences were classified phylogenetically within the known lineages.

Title: Epidemiology of human coronavirus NL63 infection among hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Taiwan.
Abstract: Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 is recognized in association with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010-2011. Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16-25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains. Understanding epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan provides an insight for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: This epidemiological study reports prevalence and clinical features of HCoV-NL63 infection but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A systematic review of reported reassortant viral lineages of influenza A.
Abstract: Most previous evolutionary studies of influenza A have focussed on genetic drift, or reassortment of specific gene segments, hosts or subtypes. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify reported claimed reassortant influenza A lineages with genomic data available in GenBank, to obtain 646 unique first-report isolates out of a possible 20,781 open-access genomes. After adjusting for correlations, only: swine as host, China, Europe, Japan and years between 1997 and 2002; remained as significant risk factors for the reporting of reassortant viral lineages. For swine H1, more reassortants were observed in the North American H1 clade compared with the Eurasian avian-like H1N1 clade. Conversely, for avian H5 isolates, a higher number of reported reassortants were observed in the European H5N2/H3N2 clade compared with the H5N2 North American clade. Despite unavoidable biases (publication, database choice and upload propensity) these results synthesize a large majority of the current literature on novel reported influenza A reassortants and are a potentially useful prerequisite to inform further algorithmic studies.

Title: Epidemic Reconstruction in a Phylogenetics Framework: Transmission Trees as Partitions of the Node Set.
Abstract: The use of genetic data to reconstruct the transmission tree of infectious disease epidemics and outbreaks has been the subject of an increasing number of studies, but previous approaches have usually either made assumptions that are not fully compatible with phylogenetic inference, or, where they have based inference on a phylogeny, have employed a procedure that requires this tree to be fixed. At the same time, the coalescent-based models of the pathogen population that are employed in the methods usually used for time-resolved phylogeny reconstruction are a considerable simplification of epidemic process, as they assume that pathogen lineages mix freely. Here, we contribute a new method that is simultaneously a phylogeny reconstruction method for isolates taken from an epidemic, and a procedure for transmission tree reconstruction. We observe that, if one or more samples is taken from each host in an epidemic or outbreak and these are used to build a phylogeny, a transmission tree is equivalent to a partition of the set of nodes of this phylogeny, such that each partition element is a set of nodes that is connected in the full tree and contains all the tips corresponding to samples taken from one and only one host. We then implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure for simultaneous sampling from the spaces of both trees, utilising a newly-designed set of phylogenetic tree proposals that also respect node partitions. We calculate the posterior probability of these partitioned trees based on a model that acknowledges the population structure of an epidemic by employing an individual-based disease transmission model and a coalescent process taking place within each host. We demonstrate our method, first using simulated data, and then with sequences taken from the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak that occurred in the Netherlands in 2003. We show that it is superior to established coalescent methods for reconstructing the topology and node heights of the phylogeny and performs well for transmission tree reconstruction when the phylogeny is well-resolved by the genetic data, but caution that this will often not be the case in practice and that existing genetic and epidemiological data should be used to configure such analyses whenever possible. This method is available for use by the research community as part of BEAST, one of the most widely-used packages for reconstruction of dated phylogenies.

Reason: This methodological paper develops a phylogenetic framework for reconstructing transmission trees from genetic data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Virus evolution and transmission in an ever more connected world.
Abstract: The frequency and global impact of infectious disease outbreaks, particularly those caused by emerging viruses, demonstrate the need for a better understanding of how spatial ecology and pathogen evolution jointly shape epidemic dynamics. Advances in computational techniques and the increasing availability of genetic and geospatial data are helping to address this problem, particularly when both information sources are combined. Here, we review research at the intersection of evolutionary biology, human geography and epidemiology that is working towards an integrated view of spatial incidence, host mobility and viral genetic diversity. We first discuss how empirical studies have combined viral spatial and genetic data, focusing particularly on the contribution of evolutionary analyses to epidemiology and disease control. Second, we explore the interplay between virus evolution and global dispersal in more depth for two pathogens: human influenza A virus and chikungunya virus. We discuss the opportunities for future research arising from new analyses of human transportation and trade networks, as well as the associated challenges in accessing and sharing relevant spatial and genetic data.

Title: Design and testing of multiplex RT-PCR primers for the rapid detection of influenza A virus genomic segments: Application to equine influenza virus.
Abstract: The avian influenza A virus causes respiratory infections in animal species. It can undergo genomic recombination with newly obtained genetic material through an interspecies transmission. However, the process is an unpredictable event, making it difficult to predict the emergence of a new pandemic virus and distinguish its origin, especially when the virus is the result of multiple infections. Therefore, identifying a novel influenza is entirely dependent on sequencing its whole genome. Occasionally, however, it can be time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive when sequencing many influenza viruses. To compensate for the difficulty, we developed a rapid, cost-effective, and simple multiplex RT-PCR to identify the viral genomic segments. As an example to evaluate its performance, H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) was studied for the purpose. In developing this protocol to amplify the EIV eight-segments, a series of processes, including phylogenetic analysis based on different influenza hosts, in silico analyses to estimate primer specificity, coverage, and variation scores, and investigation of host-specific amino acids, were progressively conducted to reduce or eliminate the negative factors that might affect PCR amplification. Selectively, EIV specific primers were synthesized with dual priming oligonucleotides (DPO) system to increase primer specificity. As a result, 16 primer pairs were selected to screen the dominantly circulating H3N8 EIV 8 genome segments: PA (3), PB2 (1), PA (3), NP (3), NA8 (2), HA3 (1), NS (1), and M (2). The diagnostic performance of the primers was evaluated with eight sets composing of four segment combinations using viral samples from various influenza hosts. The PCR results suggest that the multiplex RT-PCR has a wide range of applications in detection and diagnosis of newly emerging EIVs. Further, the proposed procedures of designing multiplex primers are expected to be used for detecting other animal influenza A viruses.

Title: Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011.
Abstract: Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses phylogenetic analyses to investigate transmission chains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fast Dating Using Least-Squares Criteria and Algorithms.
Abstract: Phylogenies provide a useful way to understand the evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such data. However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here, we present very fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related to the Langley-Fitch molecular-clock model. We show that this model is robust to uncorrelated violations of the molecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the close relationships between least-squares and linear algebra. We distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large input trees (>10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and transformed into time-scaled trees. We compare these algorithms to standard methods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley-Fitch method, and BEAST). Using simulated data, we show that their estimation accuracy is similar to that of the most sophisticated methods, while their computing time is much faster. We apply these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results show that these algorithms provide a very fast alternative with results similar to those of other computer programs. These algorithms are implemented in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can be downloaded from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all our data sets and detailed results. An Online Appendix, providing additional algorithm descriptions, tables, and figures can be found in the Supplementary Material available on Dryad at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.968t3.

Title: Phylogenetic network analysis as a parsimony optimization problem.
Abstract: Many problems in comparative biology are, or are thought to be, best expressed as phylogenetic "networks" as opposed to trees. In trees, vertices may have only a single parent (ancestor), while networks allow for multiple parent vertices. There are two main interpretive types of networks, "softwired" and "hardwired." The parsimony cost of hardwired networks is based on all changes over all edges, hence must be greater than or equal to the best tree cost contained ("displayed") by the network. This is in contrast to softwired, where each character follows the lowest parsimony cost tree displayed by the network, resulting in costs which are less than or equal to the best display tree. Neither situation is ideal since hard-wired networks are not generally biologically attractive (since individual heritable characters can have more than one parent) and softwired networks can be trivially optimized (containing the best tree for each character). Furthermore, given the alternate cost scenarios of trees and these two flavors of networks, hypothesis testing among these explanatory scenarios is impossible. A network cost adjustment (penalty) is proposed to allow phylogenetic trees and soft-wired phylogenetic networks to compete equally on a parsimony optimality basis. This cost is demonstrated for several real and simulated datasets. In each case, the favored graph representation (tree or network) matched expectation or simulation scenario. The softwired network cost regime proposed here presents a quantitative criterion for an optimality-based search procedure where trees and networks can participate in hypothesis testing simultaneously.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses were descended from viruses of the second wave of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections during 2013. These viruses can be divided into 2 branches.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and lineage classification of H7N9 viruses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Detection of influenza A(H3N2) virus in children with suspected mumps during winter 2014/15 in England.
Abstract: Influenza A(H3N2) virus was detected in oral fluid from 16/107 children (aged 2 to 12 years) with a clinical diagnosis of mumps, who were sampled between December 2014 and February 2015 in England, during the peak of the 2014/15 influenza season. Sequence analysis of an A(H3N2) virus from a child with suspected mumps showed the virus was similar to other circulating A(H3N2) viruses detected in winter 2014/15, which were antigenically drifted from the A(H3N2) vaccine strain.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports detection and sequence similarity of H3N2 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypic variations to phenotypic traits.

Title: The Reemergent 1977 H1N1 Strain and the Gain-of-Function Debate.
Abstract: The 1977-1978 influenza epidemic was probably not a natural event, as the genetic sequence of the virus was nearly identical to the sequences of decades-old strains. While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review and discussion of the origin of the 1977 H1N1 strain and gain-of-function debate, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: New Routes to Phylogeography: A Bayesian Structured Coalescent Approximation.
Abstract: Phylogeographic methods aim to infer migration trends and the history of sampled lineages from genetic data. Applications of phylogeography are broad, and in the context of pathogens include the reconstruction of transmission histories and the origin and emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference based on bottom-up population genetics models is computationally expensive, and as a result faster alternatives based on the evolution of discrete traits have become popular. In this paper, we show that inference of migration rates and root locations based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA (BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent with the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few populations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers that successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled non-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly concludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an increasingly prominent role informing the control and prevention of infectious diseases, it will be vital that phylogeographic inference provides robust insights into transmission history.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogeographic methods and inference of migration and transmission history without explicit genotype-phenotype associations.

Title: Phylogenetic and Molecular Analysis of an H7N7 Avian Influenza Virus Isolated in East Dongting Lake in 2012.
Abstract: In March 2012, an H7N7 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) named A/wild goose/Dongting/PC0360/2012 (H7N7) (DT/PC0360) was recovered from a wild goose in East Dongting Lake. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the isolate, and analyzed the phylogenetic and molecular characterization. RNA was extracted from environment samples (including fecal samples from wild bird or domestic ducks, and water samples) for detecting the presence of Influenza A Virus targeting Matrix gene, using realtime RT-PCR assay. The positive samples were performed virus isolation with embryonated eggs. The subtype of the isolates were identified by RT-PCR assay with the H1-H16 and N1-N9 primer set. The whole-genome sequencing of isolates were performed. Phylogenetic and molecular characterizations of the eight genes of the isolates were analyzed. Our results suggested that all the eight gene segments of DT/PC0360 belonged to the Eurasian gene pool, and the HA gene were belonged to distinct sublineage with H7N9 AIV which caused outbreaks in Mainland China in 2013. The hemagglutinin cleavage site of HA of DT/PC0360 showed characterization of low pathogenic avian influenza virus. Strengthening the surveillance of AIVs of wild waterfowl and poultry in this region is vital for our knowledge of the ecology and mechanism of transmission to prevent an influenza pandemic.

Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic and molecular characterization of an H7N7 avian influenza virus isolate, describing gene segment origins and pathogenicity markers, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: SNPGenie: estimating evolutionary parameters to detect natural selection using pooled next-generation sequencing data.
Abstract: New applications of next-generation sequencing technologies use pools of DNA from multiple individuals to estimate population genetic parameters. However, no publicly available tools exist to analyse single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling results directly for evolutionary parameters important in detecting natural selection, including nucleotide diversity and gene diversity. We have developed SNPGenie to fill this gap. The user submits a FASTA reference sequence(s), a Gene Transfer Format (.GTF) file with CDS information and a SNP report(s) in an increasing selection of formats. The program estimates nucleotide diversity, distance from the reference and gene diversity. Sites are flagged for multiple overlapping reading frames, and are categorized by polymorphism type: nonsynonymous, synonymous, or ambiguous. The results allow single nucleotide, single codon, sliding window, whole gene and whole genome/population analyses that aid in the detection of positive and purifying natural selection in the source population. SNPGenie version 1.2 is a Perl program with no additional dependencies. It is free, open-source, and available for download at https://github.com/hugheslab/snpgenie. nelsoncw@email.sc.edu or austin@biol.sc.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Relevant: False
Reason: SNPGenie is a computational tool for estimating evolutionary parameters from sequencing data; it does not itself present explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The CCR5Δ32 (rs333) polymorphism is not a predisposing factor for severe pandemic influenza in the Brazilian admixed population.
Abstract: Recent studies have tried to identify host genetic variants that could explain severe cases and deaths in infection with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, especially among children and young adults. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response. A deletion mutation (Δ32) in this gene interferes with the response of immune cells, impairing viral clearance. We evaluated the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism (rs333) in individuals of the Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. A total of 330 subjects with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010, were genotyped for the Δ32 deletion (rs333). The cases were classified according to the progression of infection into a group of hospitalized patients (n = 156) and a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 174). No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism were observed between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and p = 0.431, respectively). The Δ32 deletion in the CCR5 gene is not associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Brazilian admixed population.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates a host genetic polymorphism (CCR5Δ32) for association with severe influenza outcomes but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Establishment of a High-Throughput Assay to Monitor Influenza A Virus RNA Transcription and Replication.
Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) poses significant threats to public health because of the recent emergence of highly pathogenic strains and wide-spread resistance to available anti-influenza drugs. Therefore, new antiviral targets and new drugs to fight influenza virus infections are needed. Although IAV RNA transcription/replication represents a promising target for antiviral drug development, no assay ideal for high-throughput screening (HTS) application is currently available to identify inhibitors targeting these processes. In this work, we developed a novel HTS assay to analyze the transcription and replication of IAV RNA using an A549 cell line stably expressing IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, NP and a viral mini-genomic RNA. Both secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and blasticidin resistance gene (Bsd) were encoded in the viral minigenome and expressed under the control of IAV RdRp. Gluc serves as a reporter to monitor the activity of IAV RdRp, and Bsd is used to maintain the expression of all foreign genes. Biochemical studies and the statistical analysis presented herein demonstrate the high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay. This work provides an ideal HTS assay for the identification of inhibitors targeting the function of IAV RdRp and a convenient reporting system for mechanism study of IAV RNA transcription / replication.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes development of a high-throughput assay to monitor influenza virus RNA transcription and replication but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Surveillance of Influenza A Virus and Its Subtypes in Migratory Wild Birds of Nepal.
Abstract: Nepal boarders India and China and all three countries lie within the Central Asian Flyway for migratory birds. Novel influenza A H7N9 caused human fatalities in China in 2013. Subclinical infections of influenza A H7N9 in birds and the potential for virus dispersal by migratory birds prompted this study to assess avian H7N9 viral intrusion into Nepal. Surveillance of influenza A virus in migratory birds was implemented in early 2014 with assistance from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Of 1811 environmental fecal samples collected from seven wetland migratory bird roosting areas, influenza A H9N2 was found in one sample from a ruddy shelduck in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve located in southern Nepal. Avian H7N9 and other highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were not detected. This study provides baseline data on the status of avian influenza virus in migratory bird populations in Nepal.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and detection of influenza A virus subtypes in migratory birds without linking specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Novel Ranking System for Identifying Efficacious Anti-Influenza Virus PB2 Inhibitors.
Abstract: Through antigenic drift and shifts, influenza virus infections continue to be an annual cause of morbidity in healthy populations and of death among elderly and at-risk patients. The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9 and the rapid spread of the swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 demonstrate the continued need for effective therapeutic agents for influenza. While several neuraminidase inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of influenza virus infections, these have shown a limited window for treatment initiation, and resistant variants have been noted in the population. In addition, an older class of antiviral drugs for influenza, the adamantanes, are no longer recommended for treatment due to widespread resistance. There remains a need for new influenza therapeutic agents with improved efficacy as well as an expanded window for the initiation of treatment. Azaindole compounds targeting the influenza A virus PB2 protein and demonstrating excellent in vitro and in vivo properties have been identified. To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of these PB2 inhibitors, we utilized a mouse influenza A virus infection model. In addition to traditional endpoints, i.e., death, morbidity, and body weight loss, we measured lung function using whole-body plethysmography, and we used these data to develop a composite efficacy score that takes compound exposure into account. This model allowed the rapid identification and ranking of molecules relative to each other and to oseltamivir. The ability to identify compounds with enhanced preclinical properties provides an opportunity to develop more-effective treatments for influenza in patients.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper evaluates efficacy of PB2 inhibitors in vivo but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Abundance and specificity of influenza reactive circulating memory follicular helper and non-follicular helper CD4 T cells in healthy adults.
Abstract: CD4 T-cell responses are functionally complex and regulate many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. Follicular helper (Tfh) cells are CD4 T cells specialized to support B-cell production of isotype-switched, high-affinity antibody. So far, studies of Tfh cells in humans have focused on their differentiation requirements, with little research devoted to their antigen specificity. Here, after separating circulating human memory CD4 T cells based on expression of CXCR5, a signature marker of Tfh, we have quantified and assayed the influenza protein antigen specificity of blood Tfh cells and CD4 T cells lacking this marker. Through the use of peptide pools derived from nucleoprotein (NP) or haemagglutinin (HA) and a panel of human donors, we have discovered that circulating Tfh cells preferentially recognize peptide epitopes from HA while cells lacking CXCR5 are enriched for specificity toward NP. These studies suggest that reactive CD4 T cells specific for distinct viral antigens may have generalized differences in their functional potential due to their previous stimulation history.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T cell responses to influenza antigens without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Low expression of activation marker CD69 and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 on memory T cells after 2009 H1N1 influenza A antigen stimulation in vitro following H1N1 vaccination of HIV-infected individuals.
Abstract: Unlike well-studied antibody responses to pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus vaccines in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) individuals, less well understood are cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to this antigen in this susceptible population. We investigated such influenza-specific CMI responses in 61 HIV+ individuals and in 20 HIV-negative (HIV-) healthy controls. Each was vaccinated with a single licensed dose of inactivated, split-virion vaccine comprised of the influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus-like strain. Cells collected just prior to vaccination and at 1 and 3 months afterwards were stimulated in vitro with dialyzed vaccine antigen and assayed by flow cytometry for cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-10, for degranulation marker CD107a, as well as phenotypes of memory T-cell subpopulations. Comparable increases of cytokine-producing and CD107a-expressing T cells were observed in both HIV+ subjects and healthy HIV-controls. However, by 3 months post-vaccination, in vitro antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced greater expansion in controls of both CD4 and CD8 central memory and effector memory T cells, as well as higher expression of the activation marker CD69 and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 than in HIV+ subjects. We concluded CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells produce cytokines at comparable levels in both groups, whereas the expression after in vitro stimulation of molecules critical for cell migration to infection sites are lower in the HIV+ than in comparable controls. Further immunization strategies against influenza are needed to improve the CMI responses in people living with HIV.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates immune responses in HIV-infected individuals post-vaccination without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Role of Human Transportation Networks in Mediating the Genetic Structure of Seasonal Influenza in the United States.
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for human mobility networks when modeling epidemics in order to accurately predict spatial dynamics. However, little is known about the impact these movement networks have on the genetic structure of pathogen populations and whether these effects are scale-dependent. We investigated how human movement along the aviation and commuter networks contributed to intra-seasonal genetic structure of influenza A epidemics in the continental United States using spatially-referenced hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences collected from 2003-2013 for both the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes. Comparative analysis of these transportation networks revealed that the commuter network is highly spatially-organized and more heavily traveled than the aviation network, which instead is characterized by high connectivity between all state pairs. We found that genetic distance between sequences often correlated with distance based on interstate commuter network connectivity for the H1N1 subtype, and that this correlation was not as prevalent when geographic distance or aviation network connectivity distance was assessed against genetic distance. However, these patterns were not as apparent for the H3N2 subtype at the scale of the continental United States. Finally, although sequences were spatially referenced at the level of the US state of collection, a community analysis based on county to county commuter connections revealed that commuting communities did not consistently align with state geographic boundaries, emphasizing the need for the greater availability of more specific sequence location data. Our results highlight the importance of utilizing host movement data in characterizing the underlying genetic structure of pathogen populations and demonstrate a need for a greater understanding of the differential effects of host movement networks on pathogen transmission at various spatial scales.

Title: High Inter-Individual Diversity of Point Mutations, Insertions, and Deletions in Human Influenza Virus Nucleoprotein-Specific Memory B Cells.
Abstract: The diversity of virus-specific antibodies and of B cells among different individuals is unknown. Using single-cell cloning of antibody genes, we generated recombinant human monoclonal antibodies from influenza nucleoprotein-specific memory B cells in four adult humans with and without preceding influenza vaccination. We examined the diversity of the antibody repertoires and found that NP-specific B cells used numerous immunoglobulin genes. The heavy chains (HCs) originated from 26 and the kappa light chains (LCs) from 19 different germ line genes. Matching HC and LC chains gave rise to 43 genetically distinct antibodies that bound influenza NP. The median lengths of the CDR3 of the HC, kappa and lambda LC were 14, 9 and 11 amino acids, respectively. We identified changes at 13.6% of the amino acid positions in the V gene of the antibody heavy chain, at 8.4% in the kappa and at 10.6 % in the lambda V gene. We identified somatic insertions or deletions in 8.1% of the variable genes. We also found several small groups of clonal relatives that were highly diversified. Our findings demonstrate broadly diverse memory B cell repertoires for the influenza nucleoprotein. We found extensive variation within individuals with a high number of point mutations, insertions, and deletions, and extensive clonal diversification. Thus, structurally conserved proteins can elicit broadly diverse and highly mutated B-cell responses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes diversity of memory B cell antibodies against influenza nucleoprotein without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiology, Evolution, and Recent Outbreaks of Avian Influenza Virus in China.
Abstract: Novel reassortants of H7N9, H10N8, and H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are currently circulating in China's poultry flocks, occasionally infecting humans and other mammals. Combined with the sometimes enzootic H5N1 and H9N2 strains, this cauldron of genetically diverse AIVs pose significant risks to public health. Here, we review the epidemiology, evolution, and recent outbreaks of AIVs in China, discuss reasons behind the recent increase in the emergence of novel AIVs, and identify warning signs which may point to the emergence of a potentially virulent and highly transmissible AIV to humans. This review will be useful to authorities who consider options for the detection and control of AIV transmission in animals and humans, with the goal of preventing future epidemics and pandemics.

Title: Global circulation patterns of seasonal influenza viruses vary with antigenic drift.
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and circulation of new human seasonal influenza virus variants is a key scientific and public health challenge. The global circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2 viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2012. Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East and Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses persisted across several seasons and exhibited complex global dynamics with East and Southeast Asia playing a limited role in disseminating new variants. The less frequent global movement of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less frequent epidemics compared to A/H3N2 viruses. Detailed epidemic models support differences in age of infection, combined with the less frequent travel of children, as probable drivers of the differences in the patterns of global circulation, suggesting a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology, and human behaviour.

Reason: The paper analyzes global circulation patterns and antigenic drift based on sequence data but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Fatal H5N6 Avian Influenza Virus Infection in a Domestic Cat and Wild Birds in China.
Abstract: H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) may pose a potential human risk as suggested by the first documented naturally-acquired human H5N6 virus infection in 2014. Here, we report the first cases of fatal H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in a domestic cat and wild birds. These cases followed human H5N6 infections in China and preceded an H5N6 outbreak in chickens. The extensive migration routes of wild birds may contribute to the geographic spread of H5N6 AIVs and pose a risk to humans and susceptible domesticated animals, and the H5N6 AIVs may spread from southern China to northern China by wild birds. Additional surveillance is required to better understand the threat of zoonotic transmission of AIVs.

Title: Influenza A virus on oceanic islands: host and viral diversity in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean.
Abstract: Ducks and seabirds are natural hosts for influenza A viruses (IAV). On oceanic islands, the ecology of IAV could be affected by the relative diversity, abundance and density of seabirds and ducks. Seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the Western Indian Ocean and, in this region, oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential IAV host species. Based on serological assays, we assessed the host range of IAV and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes). We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns. We discuss the role of tern migrations in the spread of viruses to and between oceanic islands, in particular for the H2 and H9 IAV subtypes.
Relevant: False

Title: Nomenclature updates resulting from the evolution of avian influenza A(H5) virus clades 2.1.3.2a, 2.2.1, and 2.3.4 during 2013-2014.
Abstract: The A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like hemagglutinin (HA) genes of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses have continued to rapidly evolve since the most recent update to the H5 clade nomenclature by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group. New clades diverging beyond established boundaries need to be identified and designated accordingly. Hemagglutinin sequences deposited in publicly accessible databases up to December 31, 2014, were analyzed by phylogenetic and average pairwise distance methods to identify new clades that merit nomenclature changes. Three new clade designations were recommended based on division of clade 2·1·3·2a (Indonesia), 2·2·1 (Egypt), and 2·3·4 (widespread detection in Asia, Europe, and North America) that includes newly emergent HPAI virus subtypes H5N2, H5N3, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. Continued global surveillance for HPAI A(H5) viruses in all host species and timely reporting of sequence data will be critical to quickly identify new clades and assess their potential impact on human and animal health.

Title: Serological evidence of influenza A viruses in frugivorous bats from Africa.
Abstract: Bats are likely natural hosts for a range of zoonotic viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, Rabies, as well as for various Corona- and Paramyxoviruses. In 2009/10, researchers discovered RNA of two novel influenza virus subtypes--H17N10 and H18N11--in Central and South American fruit bats. The identification of bats as possible additional reservoir for influenza A viruses raises questions about the role of this mammalian taxon in influenza A virus ecology and possible public health relevance. As molecular testing can be limited by a short time window in which the virus is present, serological testing provides information about past infections and virus spread in populations after the virus has been cleared. This study aimed at screening available sera from 100 free-ranging, frugivorous bats (Eidolon helvum) sampled in 2009/10 in Ghana, for the presence of antibodies against the complete panel of influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) types ranging from H1 to H18 by means of a protein microarray platform. This technique enables simultaneous serological testing against multiple recombinant HA-types in 5 μl of serum. Preliminary results indicate serological evidence against avian influenza subtype H9 in about 30% of the animals screened, with low-level cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related subtypes H8 and H12. To our knowledge, this is the first report of serological evidence of influenza A viruses other than H17 and H18 in bats. As avian influenza subtype H9 is associated with human infections, the implications of our findings from a public health context remain to be investigated.
Relevant: False

Title: Computational Characterization of Transient Strain-Transcending Immunity against Influenza A.
Abstract: The enigmatic observation that the rapidly evolving influenza A (H3N2) virus exhibits, at any given time, a limited standing genetic diversity has been an impetus for much research. One of the first generative computational models to successfully recapitulate this pattern of consistently constrained diversity posits the existence of a strong and short-lived strain-transcending immunity. Building on that model, we explored a much broader set of scenarios (parameterizations) of a transient strain-transcending immunity, ran long-term simulations of each such scenario, and assessed its plausibility with respect to a set of known or estimated influenza empirical measures. We evaluated simulated outcomes using a variety of measures, both epidemiological (annual attack rate, epidemic duration, reproductive number, and peak weekly incidence), and evolutionary (pairwise antigenic diversity, fixation rate, most recent common ancestor, and kappa, which quantifies the potential for antigenic evolution). Taking cumulative support from all these measures, we show which parameterizations of strain-transcending immunity are plausible with respect to the set of empirically derived target values. We conclude that strain-transcending immunity which is milder and longer lasting than previously suggested is more congruent with the observed short- and long-term behavior of influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a computational modeling study of immunity and influenza evolution, not directly linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A virus evolution and spatio-temporal dynamics in Eurasian wild birds: a phylogenetic and phylogeographical study of whole-genome sequence data.
Abstract: Low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a natural host reservoir in wild waterbirds and the potential to spread to other host species. Here, we investigated the evolutionary, spatial and temporal dynamics of avian IAVs in Eurasian wild birds. We used whole-genome sequences collected as part of an intensive long-term Eurasian wild bird surveillance study, and combined this genetic data with temporal and spatial information to explore the virus evolutionary dynamics. Frequent reassortment and co-circulating lineages were observed for all eight genomic RNA segments over time. There was no apparent species-specific effect on the diversity of the avian IAVs. There was a spatial and temporal relationship between the Eurasian sequences and significant viral migration of avian IAVs from West Eurasia towards Central Eurasia. The observed viral migration patterns differed between segments. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced when analysing these surveillance and sequence data, and the caveats to be borne in mind when drawing conclusions from the apparent results of such analyses.
Relevant: False

Abstract: Genetic sequences of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) virus in England have high homology to those detected in mainland Europe and Asia during 2014. Genetic characterization suggests this virus is an avian-adapted virus without specific affinity for zoonoses. Spatio-temporal detections of H5N8 imply a role for wild birds in virus spread.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper provides genetic characterization of H5N8 virus but does not explicitly link genotype to phenotype.

Title: Full-Genome Sequence of Influenza A(H5N8) Virus in Poultry Linked to Sequences of Strains from Asia, the Netherlands, 2014.
Abstract: Genetic analyses of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) virus from the Netherlands, and comparison with strains from Europe, South Korea, and Japan, showed a close relation. Data suggest the strains were probably carried to the Netherlands by migratory wild birds from Asia, possibly through overlapping flyways and common breeding sites in Siberia.

Title: Respiratory viruses and torque teno virus in adults with acute respiratory infections.
Abstract: To define the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in adult patients. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from all adult patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), or severe ARI (SARI) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia, between March 2010 and April 2011 and analyzed for 19 respiratory viruses and for torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV). Respiratory viruses were detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes A1 and A2, the influenza B virus, human adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively. This study highlights the need to perform routine detection of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalized with ARI, asthma exacerbation, and/or pneumonia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on detection and epidemiology of respiratory viruses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza H9N2 seroprevalence among pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, China.
Abstract: Shandong province of China has a large number of pig farms with the semi-enclosed houses, allowing crowds of wild birds to seek food in the pig houses. As the carriers of avian influenza virus (AIV), these wild birds can easily pass the viruses to the pigs and even the occupational swine-exposed workers. However, thus far, serological investigation concerning H9N2 AIV in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong is sparse. To better understand the prevalence of H9N2 AIV in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, the serum samples of pigs and occupational pig-exposed workers were collected and tested for the antibodies for H9N2 AIV by both hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and micro-neutralization (MN) assays. When using the antibody titers ≥40 as cut-off value, 106 (HI: 106/2176, 4.87%) and 84 (MN: 84/2176, 3.86%) serum samples of pigs were tested positive, respectively; 6 (HI: 6/287, 2.09%) and 4 (MN: 4/287, 1.39%) serum samples of the pig farm staff were positive, respectively; however, serum samples from the control humans were tested negative in both HI and MN assays. These findings revealed that there were H9N2 AIV infections in pig population and pig farm staff in Shandong, China. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to conduct the long-term surveillance of AIV in pig population and the pig farm staff.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies in pigs and humans but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A Broad Anti-influenza Hybrid Small Molecule That Potently Disrupts the Interaction of Polymerase Acidic Protein-Basic Protein 1 (PA-PB1) Subunits.
Abstract: In continuing our efforts to identify small molecules able to disrupt the interaction of the polymerase acidic protein-basic protein 1 (PA-PB1) subunits of influenza virus (Flu) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, this paper is devoted to the optimization of a dihydrotriazolopyrimidine derivative, previously identified through structure-based drug discovery. The structure modifications performed around the bicyclic core led to the identification of compounds endowed with both the ability to disrupt PA-PB1 subunits interaction and anti-Flu activity with no cytotoxicity. Very interesting results were obtained with the hybrid molecules 36 and 37, designed by merging some peculiar structural features known to impart PA-PB1 interaction inhibition, with compound 36 that emerged as the most potent PA-PB1 interaction inhibitor (IC50 = 1.1 μM) among all the small molecules reported so far. Calculations showed a very favored H-bonding between the 2-amidic carbonyl of 36 and Q408, which seems to justify its potent ability to interfere with the interaction of the polymerase subunits.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on small molecule inhibitors targeting viral polymerase protein interactions without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Electrochemical assay to detect influenza viruses and measure drug susceptibility.
Abstract: An electrochemical assay has been designed to rapidly diagnose influenza viruses. Exposure of a glucose-bearing substrate to influenza viruses or its enzyme, neuraminidase (NA), releases glucose, which was detected amperometrically. Two methods were used to detect released glucose. First, we used a standard glucose blood meter to detect two viral NAs and three influenza strains. We also demonstrated drug susceptibility of two antivirals, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir, using the assay. Finally, we used disposable test strips to detect nineteen H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains using this assay in one hour. The limit and range of detection of this first generation assay is 10(2) and 10(2)-10(8) plaque forming units (pfu), respectively. Current user-friendly glucose meters can be repurposed to detect influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on an electrochemical assay for detecting influenza viruses and measuring drug susceptibility, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: In vivo therapeutic protection against influenza A (H1N1) oseltamivir-sensitive and resistant viruses by the iminosugar UV-4.
Abstract: Our lead iminosugar analog called UV-4 or N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin inhibits activity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) α-glucosidases I and II and is a potent, host-targeted antiviral candidate. The mechanism of action for the antiviral activity of iminosugars is proposed to be inhibition of ER α-glucosidases leading to misfolding of critical viral glycoproteins. These misfolded glycoproteins would then be incorporated into defective virus particles or targeted for degradation resulting in a reduction of infectious progeny virions. UV-4, and its hydrochloride salt known as UV-4B, is highly potent against dengue virus in vitro and promotes complete survival in a lethal dengue virus mouse model. In the current studies, UV-4 was shown to be highly efficacious via oral gavage against both oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant influenza A (H1N1) infections in mice even if treatment was initiated as late as 48-72 hours after infection. The minimal effective dose was found to be 80-100 mg/kg when administered orally thrice daily. UV-4 treatment did not affect the development of protective antibody responses after either influenza infection or vaccination. Therefore, UV-4 is a promising candidate for further development as a therapeutic intervention against influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on antiviral efficacy of a host-targeted drug without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Construction and heterologous expression of a truncated Haemagglutinin (HA) protein from the avian influenza virus H5N1 in Escherichia coli.
Abstract: Malaysia first reported H5N1 poultry case in 2004 and subsequently outbreak in poultry population in 2007. Here, a recombinant gene encoding of peptide epitopes, consisting fragments of HA1, HA2 and a polybasic cleavage site of H5N1 strain Malaysia, was amplified and cloned into pET-47b(+) bacterial expression vector. DNA sequencing and alignment analysis confirmed that the gene had no alteration and in-frame to the vector. Then, His-tagged truncated HA protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under 1 mM IPTG induction. The protein expression was optimized under a time-course induction study and further purified using Ni-NTA agarose under reducing condition. Migration size of protein was detected at 15 kDa by Western blot using anti-His tag monoclonal antibody and demonstrated no discrepancy compared to its calculated molecular weight.
Relevant: False

Title: A new method to cluster DNA sequences using Fourier power spectrum.
Abstract: A novel clustering method is proposed to classify genes and genomes. For a given DNA sequence, a binary indicator sequence of each nucleotide is constructed, and Discrete Fourier Transform is applied on these four sequences to attain respective power spectra. Mathematical moments are built from these spectra, and multidimensional vectors of real numbers are constructed from these moments. Cluster analysis is then performed in order to determine the evolutionary relationship between DNA sequences. The novelty of this method is that sequences with different lengths can be compared easily via the use of power spectra and moments. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method provides an efficient tool to classify genes and genomes. It not only gives comparable results but also is remarkably faster than other multiple sequence alignment and alignment-free methods.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on a novel clustering method for DNA sequences using Fourier power spectrum without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Extracting transmission networks from phylogeographic data for epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio in Nigeria.
Abstract: Phylogeography improves our understanding of spatial epidemiology. However, application to practical problems requires choices among computational tools to balance statistical rigor, computational complexity, sensitivity to sampling strategy and interpretability. We introduce a fast, heuristic algorithm to reconstruct partially-observed transmission networks (POTN) that combines features of phylogenetic and transmission tree approaches. We compare the transmission network generated by POTN with existing algorithms (BEAST and SeqTrack), and discuss the benefits and challenges of phylogeographic analysis on examples of epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus, H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio. For the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola virus outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, all three methods provide similarly plausible transmission histories but differ in detail. For polio in northern Nigeria, we discuss performance trade-offs between the POTN and discrete phylogeography in BEAST and conclude that spatial history reconstruction is limited by under-sampling. POTN is complementary to available tools on densely-sampled data, fails gracefully on under-sampled data and is scalable to accommodate larger datasets. We provide further evidence for the utility of phylogeography for understanding transmission networks of rapidly evolving epidemics. We propose simple heuristic criteria to identify how sampling rates and disease dynamics interact to determine fundamental limitations of phylogeographic inference.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on computational methods to reconstruct transmission networks from phylogeographic data without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Nothing to sneeze at: a dynamic and integrative computational model of an influenza A virion.
Abstract: The influenza virus is surrounded by an envelope composed of a lipid bilayer and integral membrane proteins. Understanding the structural dynamics of the membrane envelope provides biophysical insights into aspects of viral function, such as the wide-ranging survival times of the virion in different environments. We have combined experimental data from X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and lipidomics to build a model of the intact influenza A virion. This is the basis of microsecond-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the virion, providing simulations at different temperatures and with varying lipid compositions. The presence of the Forssman glycolipid alters a number of biophysical properties of the virion, resulting in reduced mobility of bilayer lipid and protein species. Reduced mobility in the virion membrane may confer physical robustness to changes in environmental conditions. Our simulations indicate that viral spike proteins do not aggregate and thus are competent for multivalent immunoglobulin G interactions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents a computational model of influenza A virion structure and dynamics without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Effectiveness and knowledge, attitudes and practices of seasonal influenza vaccine in primary healthcare settings in South Africa, 2010-2013.
Abstract: Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and coverage data for sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. Using a test-negative case-control design, we estimated influenza VE annually among individuals with influenza-like illness presenting to an outpatient sentinel surveillance programme in South Africa from 2010 to 2013. A knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) influenza vaccine survey of programme clinicians was conducted in 2013. In total, 9420 patients were enrolled in surveillance of whom 5344 (56.7%) were included in the VE analysis: 2678 (50.1%) were classified as controls (influenza test-negative) and 2666 (49.9%) as cases (influenza test-positive). Mean annual influenza vaccine coverage among controls was 4.5% for the four years. Annual VE estimates adjusted for age, underlying medical conditions and seasonality for 2010-2013 were 54.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-78.6%), 57.1% (95% CI: 15.5-78.2%), 38.4% (95% CI: -71.7-78.1%) and 87.2% (95% CI: 67.2-95.0%), respectively. The KAP survey showed that >90% of clinicians were familiar with the indications for and the benefits of influenza vaccination. Our study showed that the vaccine was significantly protective in 2010, 2011 and 2013, but not in 2012 when the circulating A(H3N2) strain showed genetic drift. Vaccine coverage was low despite good clinician knowledge of vaccination indications. Further studies are needed to investigate the reason for the low uptake of influenza vaccine.

Title: Cross-species transmission and emergence of novel viruses from birds.
Abstract: Birds, the only living member of the Dinosauria clade, are flying warm-blooded vertebrates displaying high species biodiversity, roosting and migratory behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system. Birds provide the natural reservoir for numerous viral species and therefore gene source for evolution, emergence and dissemination of novel viruses. The intrusions of human into natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and the increasing poultry consumption by human have facilitated avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel adenovirus was exclusively found in birds causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans. Instead of being the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human, a novel avian virus can be an augmenter of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of birds' evolutionary dynamics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a general review of avian viruses and their cross-species transmission without explicit links between specific viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Efficient generation of recombinant influenza A viruses employing a new approach to overcome the genetic instability of HA segments.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are the most relevant and continual source of severe infectious respiratory complications in humans and different animal species, especially poultry. Therefore, an efficient vaccination that elicits protective and neutralizing antibodies against the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) is an important strategy to counter annual epidemics or occasional pandemics. With the help of plasmid-based reverse genetics technology, it is possible that IAV vaccine strains (IVVS) are rapidly generated. However, the genetic instability of some cloned HA-cDNAs after transformation into competent bacteria represents a major obstacle. Herein, we report efficient cloning strategies of different genetically volatile HA segments (H5- and H9-subtypes) employing either a newly constructed vector for reverse genetics (pMKPccdB) or by the use of the Escherichia coli strain HB101. Both approaches represent improved and generalizable strategies to establish functional reverse genetics systems preventing genetic changes to the cloned (HA) segments of IAV facilitating more efficient rescue of recombinant IAV for basic research and vaccine development.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on cloning strategies and genetic stability of HA segments for reverse genetics, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The energy sensor AMPK regulates T cell metabolic adaptation and effector responses in vivo.
Abstract: Naive T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands of effector T cell function. However, how nutrient availability influences T cell metabolism and function remains poorly understood. Here we report plasticity in effector T cell metabolism in response to changing nutrient availability. Activated T cells were found to possess a glucose-sensitive metabolic checkpoint controlled by the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that regulated mRNA translation and glutamine-dependent mitochondrial metabolism to maintain T cell bioenergetics and viability. T cells lacking AMPKα1 displayed reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular ATP in response to glucose limitation in vitro or pathogenic challenge in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that AMPKα1 is essential for T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell development and primary T cell responses to viral and bacterial infections in vivo. Our data highlight AMPK-dependent regulation of metabolic homeostasis as a key regulator of T cell-mediated adaptive immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T cell metabolic adaptation and immune responses regulated by AMPK, without explicit links between viral genotypes and viral phenotypes.

Title: Validation of normal human bronchial epithelial cells as a model for influenza A infections in human distal trachea.
Abstract: Primary normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells, derived from the distal-most aspect of the trachea at the bifurcation, have been used for a number of studies in respiratory disease research. Differences between the source tissue and the differentiated primary cells may impact infection studies based on this model. Therefore, we examined how well-differentiated NHBE cells compared with their source tissue, the human distal trachea, as well as the ramifications of these differences on influenza A viral pathogenesis research using this model. We employed a histological analysis including morphological measurements, electron microscopy, multi-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, lectin histochemistry, and microarray expression analysis to compare differentiated NHBEs to human distal tracheal epithelium. Pseudostratified epithelial height, cell type variety and distribution varied significantly. Electron microscopy confirmed differences in cellular attachment and paracellular junctions. Influenza receptor lectin histochemistry revealed that α2,3 sialic acids were rarely present on the apical aspect of the differentiated NHBE cells, but were present in low numbers in the distal trachea. We bound fluorochrome bioconjugated virus to respiratory tissue and NHBE cells and infected NHBE cells with human influenza A viruses. Both indicated that the pattern of infection progression in these cells correlated with autopsy studies of fatal cases from the 2009 pandemic.

Title: Gene expression signatures as a therapeutic target for severe H7N9 influenza - what do we know so far?
Abstract: A novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China in early 2013 causing > 450 cases of respiratory illness and 175 deaths within a 20-month period. Though avian viruses infect humans infrequently, the lack of human immunity to these viruses raises the possibility of a pandemic if they were to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently. Despite the fact that IAV pathogenicity results from the cytopathic effects and tissue damage caused by both viral replication and an overly robust immune response, current IAV therapeutics only target the viral proteins. This has led to the emergence of drug resistance due to the high mutation rates of viruses. The growing obsolescence of our current influenza therapeutics underscores the need for alternative treatment strategies. One promising area of research is the use of drugs that target the host response to IAV infection. This article describes how gene expression profiling can be used to predict drugs that reverse the destructive effects of the host response to H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The article discusses host gene expression signatures and therapeutic targets for H7N9 influenza but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Reverse zoonosis of influenza to swine: new perspectives on the human-animal interface.
Abstract: The origins of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in swine are unknown, highlighting gaps in our understanding of influenza A virus (IAV) ecology and evolution. We review how recently strengthened influenza virus surveillance in pigs has revealed that influenza virus transmission from humans to swine is far more frequent than swine-to-human zoonosis, and is central in seeding swine globally with new viral diversity. The scale of global human-to-swine transmission represents the largest 'reverse zoonosis' of a pathogen documented to date. Overcoming the bias towards perceiving swine as sources of human viruses, rather than recipients, is key to understanding how the bidirectional nature of the human-animal interface produces influenza threats to both hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing influenza virus transmission between humans and swine, focusing on ecology and evolution without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: Avian influenza H5N1 viral and bird migration networks in Asia.
Abstract: The spatial spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and its long-term persistence in Asia have resulted in avian influenza panzootics and enormous economic losses in the poultry sector. However, an understanding of the regional long-distance transmission and seasonal patterns of the virus is still lacking. In this study, we present a phylogeographic approach to reconstruct the viral migration network. We show that within each wild fowl migratory flyway, the timing of H5N1 outbreaks and viral migrations are closely associated, but little viral transmission was observed between the flyways. The bird migration network is shown to better reflect the observed viral gene sequence data than other networks and contributes to seasonal H5N1 epidemics in local regions and its large-scale transmission along flyways. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences, improving our understanding of how bird migration drives the periodic reemergence of H5N1 in Asia.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogeographic and migration network analyses of H5N1 virus spread, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Inferring epidemiological dynamics with Bayesian coalescent inference: the merits of deterministic and stochastic models.
Abstract: Estimation of epidemiological and population parameters from molecular sequence data has become central to the understanding of infectious disease dynamics. Various models have been proposed to infer details of the dynamics that describe epidemic progression. These include inference approaches derived from Kingman's coalescent theory. Here, we use recently described coalescent theory for epidemic dynamics to develop stochastic and deterministic coalescent susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) tree priors. We implement these in a Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework to permit joint estimation of SIR epidemic parameters and the sample genealogy. We assess the performance of the two coalescent models and also juxtapose results obtained with a recently published birth-death-sampling model for epidemic inference. Comparisons are made by analyzing sets of genealogies simulated under precisely known epidemiological parameters. Additionally, we analyze influenza A (H1N1) sequence data sampled in the Canterbury region of New Zealand and HIV-1 sequence data obtained from known United Kingdom infection clusters. We show that both coalescent SIR models are effective at estimating epidemiological parameters from data with large fundamental reproductive number [Formula: see text] and large population size [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, we find that the stochastic variant generally outperforms its deterministic counterpart in terms of error, bias, and highest posterior density coverage, particularly for smaller [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. However, each of these inference models is shown to have undesirable properties in certain circumstances, especially for epidemic outbreaks with [Formula: see text] close to one or with small effective susceptible populations.

Reason: This is a methodological paper on Bayesian coalescent inference for epidemiological dynamics, not directly linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogeography of Avian influenza A H9N2 in China.
Abstract: During the past two decades, avian influenza A H9N2 viruses have spread geographically and ecologically in China. Other than its current role in causing outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections by direct transmission, H9N2 virus could also serve as an progenitor for novel human avian influenza viruses including H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8. Hence, H9N2 virus is becoming a notable threat to public health. However, despite multiple lineages and genotypes that were detected by previous studies, the migration dynamics of the H9N2 virus in China is unclear. Increasing such knowledge would help us better prevent and control H9N2 as well as other future potentially threatening viruses from spreading across China. The objectives of this study were to determine the source, migration patterns, and the demography history of avian influenza A H9N2 virus that circulated in China. Using Bayesian phylogeography framework, we showed that the H9N2 virus in mainland China may have originated from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). Southern China, most likely the Guangdong province acts as the primary epicentre for multiple H9N2 strains spreading across the whole country, and eastern China, most likely the Jiangsu province, acts as an important secondary source to seed outbreaks. Our demography inference suggests that during the long-term migration process, H9N2 evolved into multiple diverse lineages and then experienced a selective sweep, which reduced its genetic diversity. Importantly, such a selective sweep may pose a greater threat to public health because novel strains confer higher fitness advantages than strains being replaced and could generate new viruses through reassortment. Our analyses indicate that migratory birds, poultry trade and transportation have all contributed to the spreading of the H9N2 virus in China. The ongoing migration and evolution of H9N2, which poses a constant threat to the human population, highlights the need for a more comprehensive surveillance of wild birds and for the enhancement of biosafety for China's poultry industry.

Abstract: The 1957 A/H2N2 influenza virus caused an estimated 2 million fatalities during the pandemic. Since viruses of the H2 subtype continue to infect avian species and pigs, the threat of reintroduction into humans remains. To determine factors involved in the zoonotic origin of the 1957 pandemic, we performed analyses on genetic sequences of 175 newly sequenced human and avian H2N2 virus isolates and all publicly available influenza virus genomes.

Title: Genetic diversity of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in Saudi Arabia.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally in the spring of 2009. Saudi Arabia also witnessed a severe H1N1 pandemic virus epidemic with considerable morbidity and mortality in different parts of the kingdom beginning in June 2009. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in samples collected between May 2009 and November 2010 from Makkah region. This study provides data on the viral diagnosis and genetic diversity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus from Saudi Arabia. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 100 clinically infected patients in the peak of the outbreak were collected from Makkah region and processed for viral diagnosis by viral culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HA and NA genes of 10 selected samples were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 100 samples were collected; only 10 samples were found to be positive for influenza A virus infection by real-time PCR. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA and NA genes of influenza A (H1N1) from Saudi Arabia showed significant similarities with selected isolates. The phylogenetic tree constructed for both HA and NA genes formed close clusters with selected reference isolates. Nucleotide sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships of the HA and NA genes of influenza A (H1N1) virus from Saudi Arabia with selected reference isolates indicates that they were genetically close and most probably originated from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Title: Molecular characterization of an influenza A virus (H4N2) isolated from waterfowl habitats in the State of Mexico.
Abstract: Wild waterfowl and their habitats are the main reservoirs of influenza A virus (IAV) mainly during the breeding season and prior to migration. This study describes the molecular characterization of an IAV isolated from 240 water samples of a small wetland during non-breeding season of migratory wild ducks in the State of Mexico, Mexico. The results showed that the virus belongs to the H4N2 subtype and each of its eight segments of the viral genome has similarity to IAV isolated from ducks in North America. This study suggests that IAV can be isolated from small wetland during non-breeding season of migrating waterfowl.

Title: Temporal dynamics, diversity, and interplay in three components of the virodiversity of a Mallard population: influenza A virus, avian paramyxovirus and avian coronavirus.
Abstract: Multiple infections, or simultaneous infection of a host with multiple parasites, are the rule rather than the exception. Interactions between co-occurring pathogens in a population may be mutualistic, competitive or facilitative. For some pathogen combinations, these interrelated effects will have epidemiological consequences; however this is as yet poorly incorporated into practical disease ecology. For example, screening of Mallards for influenza A viruses (IAV) have repeatedly revealed high prevalence and large subtype diversity in the Northern Hemisphere. Other studies have identified avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) and coronaviruses (CoVs) in Mallards, but without making inferences on the larger viral assemblage. In this study we followed 144 wild Mallards across an autumn season in a natural stopover site and constructed infection histories of IAV, APMV-1 and CoV. There was a high prevalence of IAV, comprising of 27 subtype combinations, while APMV-1 had a comparatively low prevalence (with a peak of 2%) and limited strain variation, similar to previous findings. Avian CoVs were common, with prevalence up to 12%, and sequence analysis identified different putative genetic lineages. An investigation of the dynamics of co-infections revealed a synergistic effect between CoV and IAV, whereby CoV prevalence was higher given that the birds were co-infected with IAV. There were no interactive effects between IAV and APMV-1. Disease dynamics are the result of an interplay between parasites, host immune responses, and resources; and is imperative that we begin to include all factors to better understand infectious disease risk.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies co-infection dynamics and viral diversity in Mallards but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza A(H10N7) virus involvement in mass mortality of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in Sweden, March through October 2014.
Abstract: We provide the first scientific report of influenza A virus involvement in a mass mortality event among harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) off the west coast of Sweden. Avian influenza A (H10N7) virus was detected in the lungs of two affected animals. This subtype has not been reported in seals to date, nor has influenza A-associated mortality been reported in seals in Europe. Circulation of avian influenza viruses in mammals may have implications for public health.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports detection of avian influenza A(H10N7) virus in seals and discusses epidemiology but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Equine influenza A(H3N8) virus isolated from Bactrian camel, Mongolia.
Abstract: Because little is known about the ecology of influenza viruses in camels, 460 nasal swab specimens were collected from healthy (no overt illness) Bactrian camels in Mongolia during 2012. One specimen was positive for influenza A virus (A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012[H3N8]), which is phylogenetically related to equine influenza A(H3N8) viruses and probably represents natural horse-to-camel transmission.
Relevant: False

Abstract: After multiple discrete introductions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus into Sri Lanka, the virus was transmitted among humans, then swine. The spread of virus between geographically distant swine farms is consistent with virus dispersal associated with a vehicle used for swine transportation, although this remains unproven.

Title: Antibody landscapes after influenza virus infection or vaccination.
Abstract: We introduce the antibody landscape, a method for the quantitative analysis of antibody-mediated immunity to antigenically variable pathogens, achieved by accounting for antigenic variation among pathogen strains. We generated antibody landscapes to study immune profiles covering 43 years of influenza A/H3N2 virus evolution for 69 individuals monitored for infection over 6 years and for 225 individuals pre- and postvaccination. Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters. These results indicate that preemptive vaccine updates may improve influenza vaccine efficacy in previously exposed individuals.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper introduces antibody landscapes to analyze immune responses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Predicting evolution from the shape of genealogical trees.
Abstract: Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population, can one predict its evolutionary future? Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains. Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds by accumulation of small effect mutations, does not require species specific input and can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure. We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus. We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30% of cases and make informative predictions in 16 out of 19 years. Beyond providing a tool for prediction, our ability to make informative predictions implies persistent fitness variation among circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses.
Relevant: False

Title: Serologic screenings for H7N9 from three sources among high-risk groups in the early stage of H7N9 circulation in Guangdong Province, China.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the novel avian influenza A virus (H7N9) in three high risk groups. The groups were divided into those exposed through infected individuals, those exposed through poultry and those individuals exposed through the external environment, in the early stage of the epidemic in Guangdong Province, which is located in the southern region of China. Serologic studies were conducted among samples collected from individuals who had close contact with the first H7N9 infected patient reported in Guangdong Province, those who were most likely exposed to the first group of H7N9 infected poultry, and those who might have been exposed to H7N9 in the environmental settings, namely hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralizaiton(MN) assays using three viruses as antigens. The alignment results of the viral sequences indicated the similarity of the HA gene sequence among viruses from exposure to infected poultry, infected humans and contaminated environments were highly conserved. Seven samples of individuals exposed to contaminated environments were positive in the HI assay and one sample among them was positive in the MN assay using poultry H7N9 virus as the antigen. One sample was positive against human H7N9 virus and 3 samples were positive against environmental H7N9 among those that were in contact with infected patients in HI assay. None of these were positive in MN assay. All HI titers of the 240 samples from those individuals in contact with infected poultry were less than 40 aganist the antigens from three viruses. The results suggest that when the H7N9 virus was in the early stages of circulation in Guangdong Province, the antigenic sites of the HA proteins of the H7N9 strain isolated from different hosts were highly conserved. The risk of new infection is low in individuals who have contact with the infected patients, poultry or a contaminated environment in the early stages of the circulation of the H7N9 virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper conducts serologic screenings and assesses antigenic conservation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Family clusters of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection in Guangdong Province, China.
Abstract: Since its first identification, the epizootic avian influenza A H7N9 virus has continued to cause infections in China. Two waves were observed during this outbreak. No cases were reported from Guangdong Province during the first wave, but this province became one of the prime outbreak sites during the second wave. In order to identify the transmission potential of this continuously evolving infectious virus, our research group monitored all clusters of H7N9 infections during the second wave of the epidemic in Guangdong Province. Epidemiological, clinical, and virological data on these patients were collected and analyzed. Three family clusters including six cases of H7N9 infection were recorded. The virus caused severe disease in two adult patients but only mild symptoms for all four pediatric patients. All patients reported direct poultry or poultry market exposure history. Relevant environment samples collected according to their reported exposures tested H7N9 positive. Virus isolates from patients in the same cluster shared high sequence similarities. In conclusion, although continually evolving, the currently circulating H7N9 viruses in Guangdong Province have not yet demonstrated the capacity for efficient and sustained person-to-person transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiological, clinical, and virological data of H7N9 infections and transmission potential, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus (H11N9) in migratory shorebirds wintering in the Amazon Region, Brazil.
Abstract: Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIV). Habitats in Brazil provide stopover and wintering sites for water birds that migrate between North and South America. The current study was conducted to elucidate the possibility of the transport of influenza A viruses by birds that migrate annually between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In total, 556 orotracheal/cloacal swab samples were collected for influenza A virus screening using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The influenza A virus-positive samples were subjected to viral isolation. Four samples were positive for the influenza A matrix gene by rRT-PCR. From these samples, three viruses were isolated, sequenced and characterized. All positive samples originated from a single bird species, the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), that was caught in the Amazon region at Caeté Bay, Northeast Pará, at Ilha de Canelas. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of H11N9 in the ruddy turnstone in South America.

Title: Improving pandemic influenza risk assessment.
Abstract: Assessing the pandemic risk posed by specific non-human influenza A viruses is an important goal in public health research. As influenza virus genome sequencing becomes cheaper, faster, and more readily available, the ability to predict pandemic potential from sequence data could transform pandemic influenza risk assessment capabilities. However, the complexities of the relationships between virus genotype and phenotype make such predictions extremely difficult. The integration of experimental work, computational tool development, and analysis of evolutionary pathways, together with refinements to influenza surveillance, has the potential to transform our ability to assess the risks posed to humans by non-human influenza viruses and lead to improved pandemic preparedness and response.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses challenges and approaches in pandemic risk assessment from genotype to phenotype but does not present explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Determining the phylogenetic and phylogeographic origin of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N3) in Mexico.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza virus (AIV) H7N3 outbreaks occurred 3 times in the Americas in the past 10 years and caused severe economic loss in the affected regions. In June/July 2012, new HP H7N3 outbreaks occurred at commercial farms in Jalisco, Mexico. Outbreaks continued to be identified in neighbouring states in Mexico till August 2013. To explore the origin of this outbreak, time resolved phylogenetic trees were generated from the eight segments of full-length AIV sequences in North America using BEAST. Location, subtype, avian host species and pathogenicity were modelled as discrete traits upon the trees using continuous time Markov chains. A further joint analysis among segments was performed using a hierarchical phylogenetic model (HPM) which allowed trait rates (location, subtype, host species) to be jointly inferred across different segments. The complete spatial diffusion process was visualised through virtual globe software. Our result indicated the Mexico HP H7N3 originated from the large North America low pathogenicity AIV pool through complicated reassortment events. Different segments were contributed by wild waterfowl from different N. American flyways. Five of the eight segments (HA, NA, NP, M, NS) were introduced from wild birds migrating along the central North American flyway, and PB2, PB1 and PA were introduced via the western North American flyway. These results highlight a potential role for Mexico as a hotspot of virus reassortment as it is where wild birds from different migration routes mix during the winter.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic and phylogeographic origins of H7N3 outbreaks without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The interferon-induced gene Ifi27l2a is active in lung macrophages and lymphocytes after influenza A infection but deletion of Ifi27l2a in mice does not increase susceptibility to infection.
Abstract: Interferons represent one of the first and essential host defense mechanisms after infection, and the activation of the IFN-pathway results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. The alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2A (Ifi27l2a) gene (human synonym: ISG12) is strongly up-regulated in the lung after influenza A infection in mice and has been shown in gene expression studies to be highly correlated to other activated genes. Therefore, we investigated the role of Ifi27l2a for the host defense to influenza A infections in more detail. RT-PCR analyses in non-infected mice demonstrated that Ifi27l2a was expressed in several tissues, including the lung. Detailed analyses of reporter gene expression in lungs from Ifi27l2a-LacZ mice revealed that Ifi27l2a was expressed in macrophages and lymphocytes but not in alveolar cells or bronchiolar epithelium cells. The number of macrophages and lymphocyte strongly increased in the lung after infection, but no significant increase in expression levels of the LacZ reporter gene was found within individual immune cells. Also, no reporter gene expression was found in bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar cells or infiltrating neutrophils after infection. Thus, up-regulation of Ifi27l2a in infected lungs is mainly due to the infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. Most surprisingly, deletion of Ifi27l2a in mouse knock-out lines did not result in increased susceptibility to infections with H1N1 or H7N7 influenza A virus compared to wild type C57BL/6N mice, suggesting a less important role of the gene for the host response to influenza infections than for bacterial infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host gene Ifi27l2a expression and its role in host defense, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of influenza A H7N9 virus.
Abstract: Recently, human infections with the novel avian-origin influenza A H7N9 virus have been reported from various provinces in China. Human infections with avian influenza A viruses are rare and may cause a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. This is the first time that human infection with a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus has been associated with a fatal outcome. Here, a phylogenetic and positive selective pressure analysis of haemagglutin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein (MP) genes of the novel reassortant H7N9 virus was carried out. The analysis showed that both structural genes of this reassortant virus likely originated from Euro-Asiatic birds, while NA was more likely to have originated from South Korean birds. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the MP showed a main clade and an outside cluster including four sequences from China. The United States and Guatemala classical H7N9-isolates appeared homogeneous and clustered together, although they are distinct from other classical Euro-Asiatic and novel H7N9 viruses. Selective pressure analysis did not reveal any site under statistically significant positive selective pressure in any of the three genes analyzed. Unknown certain intermediate hosts involved might be implicated, so extensive global surveillance and bird-to-person transmission should be closely considered in the future.

Title: Labeling of influenza viruses with synthetic fluorescent and biotin-labeled lipids.
Abstract: Direct labeling of virus particles is a powerful tool for the visualization of virus-cell interaction events. However, this technique involves the chemical modification of viral proteins that affects viral biological properties. Here we describe an alternative approach of influenza virus labeling that utilizes Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs that can be gently inserted into the virus membrane. We assessed whether labeling with fluorescent (fluo-Ad-DOPE) or biotin-labeled (biot-CMG2-DOPE) probes has any deleterious effect on influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) receptor specificity, neuraminidase (NA) activity, or replicative ability in vitro. Our data clearly show that neither construct significantly affected influenza virus infectivity or viral affinity to sialyl receptors. Neither construct influenced the NA activities of the influenza viruses tested, except the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) strain. Our data indicate that lipid labeling provides a powerful tool to analyze influenza virus infection in vitro.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a method for labeling influenza viruses without affecting viral properties, but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Adaptive evolution and environmental durability jointly structure phylodynamic patterns in avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been pivotal to the origination of human pandemic strains. Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses-a manifestation of the "storage effect"-highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.

Reason: The paper presents phylodynamic analyses and ecological factors influencing avian influenza virus evolution but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Multiplex evaluation of influenza neutralizing antibodies with potential applicability to in-field serological studies.
Abstract: The increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 LPAI and HPAI viruses in poultry has major public and animal health implications. The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. We propose that this robust assay may have practical utility for in-field serosurveillance and vaccine studies in resource-limited regions worldwide.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on evaluating neutralizing antibodies against influenza subtypes using pseudotypes, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The CCR5Δ32 allele is not a major predisposing factor for severe H1N1pdm09 infection.
Abstract: Host genetic factors are thought to modulated the severity of disease caused by infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm09). The human CCR5 gene encodes a cytokine receptor important for cell-mediated immune response against H1N1pdm09. A 32-bp polymorphic deletion in the coding sequence of CCR5, the so-called CCR5Δ32 allele, segregates in populations of European ancestry with a frequency of 8-15%. A high proportion of CCR5Δ32 heterozygotes was reported in a sample of white Canadian critically-ill H1N1pdm09 infected subjects, suggesting an association with disease severity. We recruited 29 H1N1pdm09 infected subjects from Southern Europe (mostly Italians) with a wide clinical spectrum of disease symptoms; the sample included 7 subjects who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The CCR5Δ32 variant was genotyped in all subjects. The CCR5Δ32 allele was found in one single subject, who developed a very mild form and was not hospitalized. The CCR5Δ32 allele was not found to be associated with the risk of H1N1pdm09 infection or with a severe disease course.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study investigates host genetic factors (CCR5Δ32 allele) and their association with disease severity, not viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Development and clinical testing of a simple, low-density gel element array for influenza identification, subtyping, and H275Y detection.
Abstract: The objectives of this study were to develop a user-friendly, gel element microarray test for influenza virus detection, subtyping, and neuraminidase inhibitor resistance detection, assess the performance characteristics of the assay, and perform a clinical evaluation on retrospective nasopharyngeal swab specimens. A streamlined microarray workflow enabled a single user to run up to 24 tests in an 8h shift. The most sensitive components of the test were the primers and probes targeting the A/H1 pdm09 HA gene with an analytical limit of detection (LoD) <100 gene copies (gc) per reaction. LoDs for all targets in nasopharyngeal swab samples were ≤1000 gc, with the exception of one target in the seasonal A/H1N1 subtype. Seasonal H275Y variants were detectable in a mixed population when present at >5% with wild type virus, while the 2009 pandemic H1N1 H275Y variant was detectable at ≤1% in a mixture with pandemic wild type virus. Influenza typing and subtyping results concurred with those obtained with real-time RT-PCR assays on more than 97% of the samples tested. The results demonstrate that a large panel of single-plex, real-time RT-PCR tests can be translated to an easy-to-use, sensitive, and specific microarray test for potential diagnostic use.

Title: Influenza virus-glycan interactions.
Abstract: It has been known for many years that influenza viruses bind by their hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein to sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) on the surface of the host cell, and that avian viruses most commonly bind to sialic acid linked α2-3 to galactose while most human viruses bind to sialic acid in the α2-6 configuration. Over the past few years there has been a large increase in data on this binding due to technological advances in glycan binding assays, reverse genetic systems for influenza and in X-ray crystallography. The results show some surprising changes in binding specificity that do not appear to affect the ability of the virus to infect host cells.

Title: Global update on the susceptibility of human influenza viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors, 2012-2013.
Abstract: Emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) is sporadic, often follows exposure to NAIs, but occasionally occurs in the absence of NAI pressure. The emergence and global spread in 2007/2008 of A(H1N1) influenza viruses showing clinical resistance to oseltamivir due to neuraminidase (NA) H275Y substitution, in the absence of drug pressure, warrants continued vigilance and monitoring for similar viruses. Four World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and one WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza (WHO CCs) tested 11,387 viruses collected by WHO-recognized National Influenza Centres (NIC) between May 2012 and May 2013 to determine 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) data for oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir. The data were evaluated using normalized IC50 fold-changes rather than raw IC50 data. Nearly 90% of the 11,387 viruses were from three WHO regions: Western Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Only 0.2% (n=27) showed highly reduced inhibition (HRI) against at least one of the four NAIs, usually oseltamivir, while 0.3% (n=39) showed reduced inhibition (RI). NA sequence data, available from the WHO CCs and from sequence databases (n=3661), were screened for amino acid substitutions associated with reduced NAI susceptibility. Those showing HRI were A(H1N1)pdm09 with NA H275Y (n=18), A(H3N2) with NA E119V (n=3) or NA R292K (n=1) and B/Victoria-lineage with NA H273Y (n=2); amino acid position numbering is A subtype and B type specific. Overall, approximately 99% of circulating viruses tested during the 2012-2013 period were sensitive to all four NAIs. Consequently, these drugs remain an appropriate choice for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports surveillance data on neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility without detailed genotype-phenotype functional analysis.

Title: Secondary structure of a conserved domain in an intron of influenza A M1 mRNA.
Abstract: Influenza A virus utilizes RNA throughout infection. Little is known, however, about the roles of RNA structures. A previous bioinformatics survey predicted multiple regions of influenza A virus that are likely to generate evolutionarily conserved and stable RNA structures. One predicted conserved structure is in the pre-mRNA coding for essential proteins, M1 and M2. This structure starts 79 nucleotides downstream of the M2 mRNA 5' splice site. Here, a combination of biochemical structural mapping, mutagenesis, and NMR confirms the predicted three-way multibranch structure of this RNA. Imino proton NMR spectra reveal no change in secondary structure when 80 mM KCl is supplemented with 4 mM MgCl2. Optical melting curves in 1 M NaCl and in 100 mM KCl with 10 mM MgCl2 are very similar, with melting temperatures ∼14 °C higher than that for 100 mM KCl alone. These results provide a firm basis for designing experiments and potential therapeutics to test for function in cell culture.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on RNA secondary structure of an influenza mRNA domain without linking viral genotype changes to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of H7N9 avian influenza virus based on a novel mathematical descriptor.
Abstract: A new mathematical descriptor was proposed based on 3D graphical representation. Using the method, we construct the phylogenetic trees of nine proteins of H7N9 influenza virus to analyze the originated source of H7N9. The results show that the evolution route of H7N9 avian influenza is from America through Europe to Asia. Furthermore, two samples collected from environment in Nanjing and Zhejiang and one sample collected from chicken are the sources of H7N9 influenza virus that infected human in China.

Title: Persistent detection of avian influenza A/H7N9 virus among poultry in Huzhou City, China, in the summer of 2013.
Abstract: In eastern China, live poultry markets were successively re-opened in the summer of 2013 following their closure in April 2013. We detected influenza A/H7N9 RNA with positive rates from 4% to 22.2% among poultry samples in targeted markets in Huzhou City, China, from August 6 to September 24, 2013. Phylogenetic analyses of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes confirmed that the strain prevalent among poultry in Huzhou City in the summer of 2013 belonged to the same genotype as those capable of infecting humans. These results raise concern for a further outbreak of H7N9 in the cooler season.

Abstract: We have developed a panel of synthetic glycans as receptor mimics for the specific capture of influenza viruses. The glycans were printed onto commercial glass slides using a free amine at the end of a spacer to generate a small focused microarray. The microarray was evaluated for its ability to capture three different strains of influenza A virus, two H1N1, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and one H3N2, A/Aichi/2/1968. We observed an excellent detection ability with some compounds exhibiting clinically relevant (10(1) plaque forming units) limit of detection. We also tested the drug susceptibility of current antivirals, Zanamivir and Ostelamivir using this microarray and could determine antiviral resistance for these strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes the development of a glycan microarray for virus detection and drug susceptibility testing but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Limited human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, Shanghai, China, March to April 2013.
Abstract: In April 2013, two members of one family were successively confirmed as cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in Shanghai, China. Respiratory specimens from the two cases and their close contacts were tested using real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR. Paired serum specimens from contacts were tested by haemagglutination inhibition assay and microneutralisation test. The index patient developed severe pneumonia. Her husband presented with pneumonia shortly thereafter. Both cases had highly similar clinical features and infection with A(H7N9) virus was confirmed in both cases by genetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high level of similarity between the sequences from the two patients and environmental samples collected from wet markets in Minhang and Changning districts. Six samples from the Changning wet market were confirmed as A(H7N9) positive. Of 27 close contacts, one developed mild respiratory symptoms and another tested positive for A(H7N9) antibodies, but both were negative by real-time RT-PCR. The other 25 close contacts of both cases were A(H7N9) negative. Limited human-to-human transmission of the virus most likely occurred in the family cluster. However, other close contacts did not test positive for the virus, suggesting limited potential for extensive human-to-human transmission of the virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports limited human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus with genetic analysis confirming infection but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from father to child: a report of limited person-to-person transmission, Guangzhou, China, January 2014.
Abstract: We investigated a possible person-to-person transmission within a family cluster of two confirmed influenza A(H7N9) patients in Guangzhou, China. The index case, a man in his late twenties, worked in a wet market that was confirmed to be contaminated by the influenza A(H7N9) virus. He developed a consistent fever and severe pneumonia after 4 January 2014. In contrast, the second case, his five-year-old child, who only developed a mild disease 10 days after disease onset of the index case, did not have any contact with poultry and birds but had unprotected and very close contact with the index case. The sequences of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of the virus stains isolated from the two cases were 100% identical. These findings strongly suggest that the second case might have acquired the infection via transmission of the virus from the sick father. Fortunately, all 40 close contacts, including the other four family members who also had unprotected and very close contact with the cases, did not acquire influenza A(H7N9) virus infection, indicating that the person-to-person transmissibility of the virus remained limited. Our finding underlines the importance of carefully, thoroughly and punctually following-up close contacts of influenza A(H7N9) cases to allow detection of any secondary cases, as these may constitute an early warning signal of the virus's increasing ability to transmit from person-to-person.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates a family cluster of H7N9 infection and genetic similarity of virus strains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: The evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and B viruses in the tropical city of Managua, Nicaragua.
Abstract: Despite mounting evidence of the high disease burden of influenza in tropical regions, relatively little viral sequence data is available from tropical countries in the Western hemisphere. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and B viruses in Managua, Nicaragua, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 1956 influenza viruses, including 335 collected for this study during 2007-2010 from a population-based cohort in Managua. North America was consistently identified as the most significant source of influenza virus diversity in Managua, although South America and Mexico were important viral sources during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The low number of viral introductions of Central American origin may reflect differences in the seasonality of influenza in Nicaragua versus neighboring countries, and underscores the need for additional data in this understudied region.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in Managua, Nicaragua, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiology and viral etiology of the influenza-like illness in corsica during the 2012-2013 Winter: an analysis of several sentinel surveillance systems.
Abstract: Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is important to identify circulating and emerging/reemerging strains and unusual epidemiological trends. The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (<15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes surveillance data and genetic drift in hemagglutinin genes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Influence of elastin-like polypeptide and hydrophobin on recombinant hemagglutinin accumulations in transgenic tobacco plants.
Abstract: Fusion protein strategies are useful tools to enhance expression and to support the development of purification technologies. The capacity of fusion protein strategies to enhance expression was explored in tobacco leaves and seeds. C-terminal fusion of elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) to influenza hemagglutinin under the control of either the constitutive CaMV 35S or the seed-specific USP promoter resulted in increased accumulation in both leaves and seeds compared to the unfused hemagglutinin. The addition of a hydrophobin to the C-terminal end of hemagglutinin did not significantly increase the expression level. We show here that, depending on the target protein, both hydrophobin fusion and ELPylation combined with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting induced protein bodies in leaves as well as in seeds. The N-glycosylation pattern indicated that KDEL sequence-mediated retention of leaf-derived hemagglutinins and hemagglutinin-hydrophobin fusions were not completely retained in the ER. In contrast, hemagglutinin-ELP from leaves contained only the oligomannose form, suggesting complete ER retention. In seeds, ER retention seems to be nearly complete for all three constructs. An easy and scalable purification method for ELPylated proteins using membrane-based inverse transition cycling could be applied to both leaf- and seed-expressed hemagglutinins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on fusion protein strategies to enhance hemagglutinin expression in plants, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Diffusion of influenza viruses among migratory birds with a focus on the Southwest United States.
Abstract: The Southwest United States, including Arizona and New Mexico, has a diverse climate and is home to many different avian species. We sequenced the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of twenty influenza specimens for the years 2007-2009. This included four from Arizona, and sixteen from New Mexico. We analyzed the sequences and determined the following HA subtypes: H3, H4, H6, H8, and H11. For each subtype, we combined our virus sequences with those from a public database, and inferred phylogeographic models of influenza diffusion. Statistical phylogeography indicated that overall evolutionary diffusion of avian influenza viruses is geographically structured (p<0.05). In addition, we found that diffusion to the Southwest was often from nearby states including California. For H3, H4 and H6, the intra-flyway gene flow rates were significantly (p<0.001) higher than those of inter-flyway. Such rate difference was also observed in H8 and H11, yet, without statistical significance (p=0.132, p=0.190, respectively). Excluding any one flyway from the calculation generated similar results, suggesting that such barrier effect on gene flow rates is not exclusively produced by any single flyway. We also calculated the Bayes factor test for the significant non-zero rates between states and identified significant routes both within and across flyways. Such inter-flyway spread of influenza was probably the result of birds from four flyways co-mingling on breeding grounds in northern regions or marshaling on staging areas post breeding in Canada or Alaska, before moving south each fall. This study provides an initial analysis of evolutionary diffusion of avian influenza virus to and from the Southwest United States. However, more sequences from this region need to be generated to determine the role of host migration and other factors on influenza diffusion.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes phylogeographic diffusion of influenza viruses among migratory birds based on HA gene sequences but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Pathological and immunohistochemical findings of natural highly pathogenic avian influenza infection in tufted ducks during 2010-2011 outbreaks in Japan.
Abstract: In the winter of 2010-2011, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection occurred in wild and domestic birds in Japan. Tufted ducks were found dead in an urban area of Toyota City, Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture. Two tufted ducks were examined histopathologically, immunohistochemically and molecularly. Gross findings included marked dark-red clotted blood in the pectoral muscles and multifocal hemorrhages on the serous membranes. Microscopically, non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, multifocal to coalescing pancreatic necrosis and severe pulmonary congestion were observed. HPAIV antigen was detected in the malacic areas, neuronal, glial and ependymal cells, pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and epithelium of pulmonary bronchioles, necrotic pancreatic acini and degenerated cardiac myocytes. The HPAIV isolate was genetically classified into clade 2.3.2.1 group A. The broad distribution of virus antigen in brain and pulmonary tissues associated with HPAIV spontaneous infection in tufted ducks might be useful in understanding its pathogenesis in nature.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports pathological and immunohistochemical findings of natural HPAI infection in tufted ducks without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: An ENU-induced splicing mutation reveals a role for Unc93b1 in early immune cell activation following influenza A H1N1 infection.
Abstract: Genetic and immunological analysis of host-pathogen interactions can reveal fundamental mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to infection. Modeling human infectious diseases among inbred mouse strains is a proven approach but is limited by naturally occurring genetic diversity. Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we created a recessive loss-of-function point mutation in Unc93b1 (unc-93 homolog B1 (C. elegans)), a chaperone for endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR9, which we termed Letr for 'loss of endosomal TLR response'. We used Unc93b1(Letr/Letr) mice to study the role of Unc93b1 in the immune response to influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), an important global respiratory pathogen. During the early phase of infection, Unc93b1(Letr/Letr) mice had fewer activated exudate macrophages and decreased expression of CXCL10, interferon (IFN)-γ and type I IFN. Mutation of Unc93b1 also led to reduced expression of the CD69 activation marker and a concomitant increase in the CD62L naive marker on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in infected lungs. Finally, loss of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in delayed viral clearance that coincided with increased tissue pathology during infection. Taken together, these findings establish a role for Unc93b1 and endosomal TLRs in the activation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells during the innate immune response to influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on a host gene mutation (Unc93b1) affecting immune response to influenza A H1N1 infection, not on viral genotypes or their phenotypes.

Title: Shotgun glycomics of pig lung identifies natural endogenous receptors for influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza viruses bind to host cell surface glycans containing terminal sialic acids, but as studies on influenza binding become more sophisticated, it is becoming evident that although sialic acid may be necessary, it is not sufficient for productive binding. To better define endogenous glycans that serve as viral receptors, we have explored glycan recognition in the pig lung, because influenza is broadly disseminated in swine, and swine have been postulated as an intermediary host for the emergence of pandemic strains. For these studies, we used the technology of "shotgun glycomics" to identify natural receptor glycans. The total released N- and O-glycans from pig lung glycoproteins and glycolipid-derived glycans were fluorescently tagged and separated by multidimensional HPLC, and individual glycans were covalently printed to generate pig lung shotgun glycan microarrays. All viruses tested interacted with one or more sialylated N-glycans but not O-glycans or glycolipid-derived glycans, and each virus demonstrated novel and unexpected differences in endogenous N-glycan recognition. The results illustrate the repertoire of specific, endogenous N-glycans of pig lung glycoproteins for virus recognition and offer a new direction for studying endogenous glycan functions in viral pathogenesis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies host glycan receptors for influenza viruses but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Continuing reassortment leads to the genetic diversity of influenza virus H7N9 in Guangdong, China.
Abstract: On 30 March 2013, a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus causing severe human respiratory infections was identified in China. Preliminary sequence analyses have shown that the virus is a reassortant of H7N9 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. In this study, we conducted enhanced surveillance for H7N9 virus in Guangdong, China, from April to August 2013. We isolated two H7N9 viral strains from environmental samples associated with poultry markets and one from a clinical patient. Sequence analyses showed that the Guangdong H7N9 virus isolated from April to May shared high sequence similarity with other strains from eastern China. The A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9) virus isolated from the Guangdong patient on 10 August 2013 was divergent from previously sequenced H7N9 viruses and more closely related to local circulating H9N2 viruses in the NS and NP genes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that four internal genes of the A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9) virus-the NS, NP, PB1, and PB2 genes-were in clusters different from those for H7N9 viruses identified previously in other provinces of China. The discovery presented here suggests that continuing reassortment led to the emergence of the A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9) virus as a novel H7N9 virus in Guangdong, China, and that viral adaptation to avian and human hosts must be assessed. In this study, we isolated and characterized the avian influenza A H7N9 virus in Guangdong, China, from April to August 2013. We show that the viruses isolated from Guangdong environmental samples and chickens from April to May 2013 were highly similar to other H7N9 strains found in eastern China. The H7N9 virus isolated from the clinical patient in Guangdong in August 2013 was divergent from previously identified H7N9 viruses, with the NS and NP genes originating from recent H9N2 viruses circulating in the province. This study provides direct evidence that continuing reassortment occurred and led to the emergence of a novel H7N9 influenza virus in Guangdong, China. These results also shed light on how the H7N9 virus evolved, which is critically important for future monitoring and tracing of viral transmission.

Title: Mucosal immunization with integrase-defective lentiviral vectors protects against influenza virus challenge in mice.
Abstract: Recent reports highlight the potential for integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) to be developed as vaccines due to their ability to elicit cell-mediated and humoral immune responses after intramuscular administration. Differently from their integrase-competent counterpart, whose utility for vaccine development is limited by the potential for insertional mutagenesis, IDLV possess a mutation in their integrase gene that prevents genomic integration. Instead, they are maintained as episomal DNA circles that retain the ability to stably express functional proteins. Despite their favorable profile, it is unknown whether IDLV elicit immune responses after intranasal administration, a route that could be advantageous in the case of infection with a respiratory agent. Using influenza as a model, we constructed IDLV expressing the influenza virus nucleoprotein (IDLV-NP), and tested their ability to generate NP-specific immune responses and protect from challenge in vivo. We found that administration of IDLV-NP elicited NP-specific T cell and antibody responses in BALB/c mice. Importantly, IDLV-NP was protective against homologous and heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge only when given by the intranasal route. This is the first report demonstrating that IDLV can induce protective immunity after intranasal administration, and suggests that IDLV may represent a promising vaccine platform against infectious agents.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates immune responses and protection induced by lentiviral vectors expressing influenza nucleoprotein, focusing on host immunity rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Detection of evolutionarily distinct avian influenza a viruses in antarctica.
Abstract: ABSTRACT Distinct lineages of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are harbored by spatially segregated birds, yet significant surveillance gaps exist around the globe. Virtually nothing is known from the Antarctic. Using virus culture, molecular analysis, full genome sequencing, and serology of samples from Adélie penguins in Antarctica, we confirmed infection by H11N2 subtype AIVs. Their genetic segments were distinct from all known contemporary influenza viruses, including South American AIVs, suggesting spatial separation from other lineages. Only in the matrix and polymerase acidic gene phylogenies did the Antarctic sequences form a sister relationship to South American AIVs, whereas distant phylogenetic relationships were evident in all other gene segments. Interestingly, their neuraminidase genes formed a distant relationship to all avian and human influenza lineages, and the polymerase basic 1 and polymerase acidic formed a sister relationship to the equine H3N8 influenza virus lineage that emerged during 1963 and whose avian origins were previously unknown. We also estimated that each gene segment had diverged for 49 to 80 years from its most closely related sequences, highlighting a significant gap in our AIV knowledge in the region. We also show that the receptor binding properties of the H11N2 viruses are predominantly avian and that they were unable to replicate efficiently in experimentally inoculated ferrets, suggesting their continuous evolution in avian hosts. These findings add substantially to our understanding of both the ecology and the intra- and intercontinental movement of Antarctic AIVs and highlight the potential risk of an incursion of highly pathogenic AIVs into this fragile environment. IMPORTANCE Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are typically maintained and spread by migratory birds, resulting in the existence of distinctly different viruses around the world. However, AIVs have not previously been detected in Antarctica. In this study, we characterized H11N2 viruses sampled from Adélie penguins from two geographically different sites in Antarctica and show that the segmented AIV genome diverged between 49 and 80 years ago from other AIVs, with several genes showing similarity and shared ancestry with H3N8 equine influenza viruses. This study provides the first insight into the ecology of AIVs in Antarctica and highlights the potential risk of an introduction of highly pathogenic AIVs into the continent.

Reason: The paper reports genetic characterization and evolutionary relationships of Antarctic avian influenza viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Efficient Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent.
Abstract: Population structure significantly affects evolutionary dynamics. Such structure may be due to spatial segregation, but may also reflect any other gene-flow-limiting aspect of a model. In combination with the structured coalescent, this fact can be used to inform phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as to infer parameters such as migration rates and subpopulation sizes from annotated sequence data. However, conducting Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent is impeded by the difficulty of constructing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms (samplers) capable of efficiently exploring the state space. In this article, we present a new MCMC sampler capable of sampling from posterior distributions over structured trees: timed phylogenetic trees in which lineages are associated with the distinct subpopulation in which they lie. The sampler includes a set of MCMC proposal functions that offer significant mixing improvements over a previously published method. Furthermore, its implementation as a BEAST 2 package ensures maximum flexibility with respect to model and prior specification. We demonstrate the usefulness of this new sampler by using it to infer migration rates and effective population sizes of H3N2 influenza between New Zealand, New York and Hong Kong from publicly available hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences under the structured coalescent. The sampler has been implemented as a publicly available BEAST 2 package that is distributed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License at http://compevol.github.io/MultiTypeTree.

Title: Deletion of the complement C5a receptor alleviates the severity of acute pneumococcal otitis media following influenza A virus infection in mice.
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that influenza A virus (IAV) promotes adherence, colonization, and superinfection by S. pneumoniae (Spn) and contributes to the pathogenesis of otitis media (OM). The complement system is a critical innate immune defense against both pathogens. To assess the role of the complement system in the host defense and the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection, we employed a well-established transtympanically-induced mouse model of acute pneumococcal OM. We found that antecedent IAV infection enhanced the severity of acute pneumococcal OM. Mice deficient in complement C1qa (C1qa-/-) or factor B (Bf -/-) exhibited delayed viral and bacterial clearance from the middle ear and developed significant mucosal damage in the eustachian tube and middle ear. This indicates that both the classical and alternative complement pathways are critical for the oto-immune defense against acute pneumococcal OM following influenza infection. We also found that Spn increased complement activation following IAV infection. This was characterized by sustained increased levels of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a in serum and middle ear lavage samples. In contrast, mice deficient in the complement C5a receptor (C5aR) demonstrated enhanced bacterial clearance and reduced severity of OM. Our data support the concept that C5a-C5aR interactions play a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection. It is possible that targeting the C5a-C5aR axis might prove useful in attenuating acute pneumococcal OM in patients with influenza infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host immune response and complement system roles in pneumococcal otitis media following influenza infection, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Prevention of influenza by targeting host receptors using engineered proteins.
Abstract: There is a need for new approaches for the control of influenza given the burden caused by annual seasonal outbreaks, the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential, and the development of resistance to current antiviral drugs. We show that multivalent biologics, engineered using carbohydrate-binding modules specific for sialic acid, mask the cell-surface receptor recognized by the influenza virus and protect mice from a lethal challenge with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The most promising biologic protects mice when given as a single 1-μg intranasal dose 7 d in advance of viral challenge. There also is sufficient virus replication to establish an immune response, potentially protecting the animal from future exposure to the virus. Furthermore, the biologics appear to stimulate inflammatory mediators, and this stimulation may contribute to their protective ability. Our results suggest that this host-targeted approach could provide a front-line prophylactic that has the potential to protect against any current and future influenza virus and possibly against other respiratory pathogens that use sialic acid as a receptor.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes engineered proteins targeting host receptors to prevent influenza infection, focusing on host-pathogen interaction rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-2 genetic variant rs708035 increases NF-κB activity through promoting TRAF6 ubiquitination.
Abstract: The IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are key regulators of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 signaling, which are critical regulators of mammalian inflammation and innate immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IRAK genes have been discovered recently. However, the functions of these IRAK SNPs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the non-synonymous IRAK2 variant rs708035 (coding D431E) increases NF-κB activity and leads to more expression of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines compared with IRAK2 wild type. Moreover, when IRAK2 knockdown cells reconstituted with siRNA-resistant WT-IRAK2 or D431E-IRAK2 were infected with influenza virus, a more obvious induction of IL-6 and a stronger anti-apoptosis effect were observed in D431E-IRAK2 expressing cells. Notably, we also found that the levels of proinflammatory cytokine-IL-6 were indeed higher in people carrying D431E-IRAK2 than those carrying WT-IRAK2. Further study demonstrated that elevated NF-κB activation mediated by the IRAK2 variant was due to increased TRAF6 ubiquitination and faster IκBα degradation. Our study provides important insight of IRAK2 SNP in the regulation of NF-κB activation and indicates that IRAK2 rs708035 might be associated with human diseases caused by hyper-activation of NF-κB.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies a human host genetic variant (IRAK2) affecting NF-κB activity and immune response to influenza virus infection, focusing on host genetics rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Construction of recombinant Marek's disease virus (rMDV) co-expressing AIV-H9N2-NA and NDV-F genes under control of MDV's own bi-directional promoter.
Abstract: To qualitatively analyze and evaluate a bi-directional promoter transcriptional function in both transient and transgenic systems, several different plasmids were constructed and recombinant MDV type 1 strain GX0101 was developed to co-express a Neuraminidase (NA) gene from Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 strain and a Fusion (F) gene from the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The two foreign genes, NDV-F gene and AIV-NA gene, were inserted in the plasmid driven in each direction by the bi-directional promoter. To test whether the expression of pp38/pp24 heterodimers are the required activators for the expression of the foreign genes, the recombinant plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F containing expression cassette for the two foreign genes was co-transfected with a pp38/pp24 expression plasmid, pBud-pp38-pp24, in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Alternatively, plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F was transfected in GX0101-infected CEFs where the viral endogenous pp38/pp24 were expressed via virus infection. The expression of both foreign genes was activated by pp38/pp24 dimers either via virus infection, or co-expression. The CEFs transfected with pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F alone had no expression. We chose to insert the expression cassette of Ppp38-NA/1.8kb-F in the non-essential region of GX0101ΔMeq US2 gene, and formed a new rMDV named MZC13NA/F through homologous recombination. Indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) test, ELISA and Western blot analyses indicated that F and NA genes were expressed simultaneously under control of the bi-directional promoter, but in opposite directions. The data also indicated the activity of the promoter in the 1.8-kb mRNA transcript direction was higher than that in the direction for the pp38 gene. The expression of pp38/pp24 dimers either via co-tranfection of the pBud-pp38-pp24 plasmid, or by GX0101 virus infection were critical to activate the bi-directional promoter for expression of two foreign genes in both directions. Therefore, the confirmed function of the bi-directional promoter provides better feasibilities to insert multiple foreign genes in MDV genome based vectors.

Title: Suppression of immunodominant antitumor and antiviral CD8+ T cell responses by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
Abstract: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan-degrading enzyme known to suppress antitumor CD8(+) T cells (TCD8). The role of IDO in regulation of antiviral TCD8 responses is far less clear. In addition, whether IDO controls both immunodominant and subdominant TCD8 is not fully understood. This is an important question because the dominance status of tumor- and virus-specific TCD8 may determine their significance in protective immunity and in vaccine design. We evaluated the magnitude and breadth of cross-primed TCD8 responses to simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen as well as primary and recall TCD8 responses to influenza A virus (IAV) in the absence or presence of IDO. IDO(-/-) mice and wild-type mice treated with 1-methyl-D-tryptophan, a pharmacological inhibitor of IDO, exhibited augmented responses to immunodominant epitopes encoded by T antigen and IAV. IDO-mediated suppression of these responses was independent of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, which remained numerically and functionally intact in IDO(-/-) mice. Treatment with L-kynurenine failed to inhibit TCD8 responses, indicating that tryptophan metabolites are not responsible for the suppressive effect of IDO in our models. Immunodominant T antigen-specific TCD8 from IDO(-/-) mice showed increased Ki-67 expression, suggesting that they may have acquired a more vigorous proliferative capacity in vivo. In conclusion, IDO suppresses immunodominant TCD8 responses to tumor and viral antigens. Our work also demonstrates that systemic primary and recall TCD8 responses to IAV are controlled by IDO. Inhibition of IDO thus represents an attractive adjuvant strategy in boosting anticancer and antiviral TCD8 targeting highly immunogenic antigens.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host immune responses and the role of IDO in T cell suppression, not direct viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Unifying viral genetics and human transportation data to predict the global transmission dynamics of human influenza H3N2.
Abstract: Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper integrates viral genetic data with human mobility data to model spatial spread but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The development and survival but not function of follicular B cells is dependent on IL-7Rα Tyr449 signaling.
Abstract: IL-7 is a critical cytokine for lymphocyte development. Recent work has highlighted critical roles for IL-7 signaling in mature T cell homeostasis and function, but its role in B cells is less well characterized. Using a knock-in mouse possessing a Tyr to Phe mutation at position 449 (IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mice) within the cytoplasmic SH2-binding motif of IL-7Rα, we evaluated the role of IL-7Rα Y449 motif in spleen B cells. IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mice had reduced numbers and increased death of follicular B cells compared to WT, but had significantly more follicular cells than IL-7Rα(-/-). The death of IL-7Rα(449F/449F) follicular cells was not due to a failure to respond to BAFF or lower levels of BAFF, a critical B cell survival factor. Marginal zone B cells were unaffected by the IL-7Rα(449F/449F) mutation. Any role for TSLP was ruled out, as TSLPR(-/-) mice had an identical B cell phenotype to wild-type mice. Bone marrow chimeras and the absence of IL-7Rα on B cells suggested that IL-7 did not directly regulate mature B cells, but that an IL-7-responsive cell was influencing B cells. IL-7 was also critical at the checkpoint between the T1 and T2 stages in the spleen. IL-7Rα(-/-) mice fail to develop T2 cells, but IL-7Rα(449F/449F) show a reduction compared to WT but not complete absence of T2 cells. We also tested the functional responses of IL-7Rα(449F/449F) to antigens and infection and found no difference in antibody responses to T-dependent or T-independent antigens, or to Influenza/A. IL-7 was important for generation of antibody responses to the intestinal worm H. polygyrus and for naive levels of IgA. Taken together, this suggests that IL-7 regulates follicular B cell numbers and survival in a cell-extrinsic manner, via a bone-marrow derived cell, but is not critical for antibody production outside the gut.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on IL-7 receptor signaling in B cells and immune function, not viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Prospective surveillance and molecular characterization of seasonal influenza in a university cohort in Singapore.
Abstract: Southeast Asia is believed to be a potential locus for the emergence of novel influenza strains, and therefore accurate sentinel surveillance in the region is critical. Limited information exists on sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in young adults in Singapore in a University campus setting. The objective of the present study was to determine the proportion of ILI caused by influenza A and B viruses in a university cohort in Singapore. We conducted a prospective surveillance study from May through October 2007, at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Basic demographic information and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from students and staff with ILI. Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation were employed to detect influenza viruses. Sequencing of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of some representative isolates was also performed. Overall proportions of influenza A and B virus infections were 47/266 (18%) and 9/266 (3%) respectively. The predominant subtype was A/H3N2 (55%) and the rest were A/H1N1 (45%). The overall sensitivity difference for detection of influenza A viruses using RT-PCR and viral isolation was 53%. Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA gene sequences of Singapore strains showed identities higher than 98% within both the genes. The strains were more similar to strains included in the WHO vaccine recommendation for the following year (2008). Genetic markers of oseltamivir resistance were not detected in any of the sequenced Singapore isolates. HA and NA gene sequences of Singapore strains were similar to vaccine strains for the upcoming influenza season. No drug resistance was found. Sentinel surveillance on university campuses should make use of molecular methods to better detect emerging and re-emerging influenza viral threats.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on surveillance, detection, and phylogenetic analysis of influenza viruses without explicit investigation or linking of viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Preliminary success in the characterization and management of a sudden breakout of a novel H7N9 influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza has always been one of the major threats to human health. The Spanish influenza in 1918, the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 2009, and the avian influenza A/H5N1 have brought about great disasters or losses to mankind. More recently, a novel avian influenza A/H7N9 broke out in China and until December 2, 2013, it had caused 139 cases of infection, including 45 deaths. Its risk and pandemic potential attract worldwide attention. In this article, we summarize epidemiology, virology characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis methods, clinical treatment and preventive measures about the avian influenza A/H7N9 virus infection to provide a reference for a possible next wave of flu outbreak.
Relevant: False

Title: Genetic structure of avian influenza viruses from ducks of the Atlantic flyway of North America.
Abstract: Wild birds, including waterfowl such as ducks, are reservoir hosts of influenza A viruses. Despite the increased number of avian influenza virus (AIV) genome sequences available, our understanding of AIV genetic structure and transmission through space and time in waterfowl in North America is still limited. In particular, AIVs in ducks of the Atlantic flyway of North America have not been thoroughly investigated. To begin to address this gap, we analyzed 109 AIV genome sequences from ducks in the Atlantic flyway to determine their genetic structure and to document the extent of gene flow in the context of sequences from other locations and other avian and mammalian host groups. The analyses included 25 AIVs from ducks from Newfoundland, Canada, from 2008-2011 and 84 available reference duck AIVs from the Atlantic flyway from 2006-2011. A vast diversity of viral genes and genomes was identified in the 109 viruses. The genetic structure differed amongst the 8 viral segments with predominant single lineages found for the PB2, PB1 and M segments, increased diversity found for the PA, NP and NS segments (2, 3 and 3 lineages, respectively), and the highest diversity found for the HA and NA segments (12 and 9 lineages, respectively). Identification of inter-hemispheric transmissions was rare with only 2% of the genes of Eurasian origin. Virus transmission between ducks and other bird groups was investigated, with 57.3% of the genes having highly similar (≥99% nucleotide identity) genes detected in birds other than ducks. Transmission between North American flyways has been frequent and 75.8% of the genes were highly similar to genes found in other North American flyways. However, the duck AIV genes did display spatial distribution bias, which was demonstrated by the different population sizes of specific viral genes in one or two neighbouring flyways compared to more distant flyways.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes genetic structure and gene flow of avian influenza viruses in ducks but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Revised and updated nomenclature for highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses.
Abstract: The divergence of the hemagglutinin gene of A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-lineage H5N1 viruses during 2011 and 2012 (807 new sequences collected through December 31, 2012) was analyzed by phylogenetic and p-distance methods to define new clades using the pre-established nomenclature system. Eight new clade designations were recommended based on division of clade 1·1 (Mekong River Delta), 2·1·3·2 (Indonesia), 2·2·2 (India/Bangladesh), 2·2·1·1 (Egypt/Israel), and 2·3·2·1 (Asia). A simplification to the previously defined criteria, which adds a letter rather than number to the right-most digit of fifth-order clades, was proposed to facilitate this and future updates.

Title: LABEL: fast and accurate lineage assignment with assessment of H5N1 and H9N2 influenza A hemagglutinins.
Abstract: The evolutionary classification of influenza genes into lineages is a first step in understanding their molecular epidemiology and can inform the subsequent implementation of control measures. We introduce a novel approach called Lineage Assignment By Extended Learning (LABEL) to rapidly determine cladistic information for any number of genes without the need for time-consuming sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, or manual annotation. Instead, LABEL relies on hidden Markov model profiles and support vector machine training to hierarchically classify gene sequences by their similarity to pre-defined lineages. We assessed LABEL by analyzing the annotated hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic (H5N1) and low pathogenicity (H9N2) avian influenza A viruses. Using the WHO/FAO/OIE H5N1 evolution working group nomenclature, the LABEL pipeline quickly and accurately identified the H5 lineages of uncharacterized sequences. Moreover, we developed an updated clade nomenclature for the H9 hemagglutinin gene and show a similarly fast and reliable phylogenetic assessment with LABEL. While this study was focused on hemagglutinin sequences, LABEL could be applied to the analysis of any gene and shows great potential to guide molecular epidemiology activities, accelerate database annotation, and provide a data sorting tool for other large-scale bioinformatic studies.

Title: Multiyear persistence of 2 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus lineages in West Africa.
Abstract: Our understanding of the global ecology of influenza viruses is impeded by historically low levels of viral surveillance in Africa. Increased genetic sequencing of African A/H1N1 pandemic influenza viruses during 2009-2013 revealed multiyear persistence of 2 viral lineages within West Africa, raising questions about the roles of reduced air traffic and the asynchrony of seasonal influenza epidemics among West African countries in the evolution of independent lineages. The potential for novel influenza virus lineages to evolve within Africa warrants intensified influenza surveillance in Africa and other understudied areas.

Title: ClassyFlu: classification of influenza A viruses with Discriminatively trained profile-HMMs.
Abstract: Accurate and rapid characterization of influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences with respect to subtype and clade is at the basis of extended diagnostic services and implicit to molecular epidemiologic studies. ClassyFlu is a new tool and web service for the classification of IAV sequences of the HA and NA gene into subtypes and phylogenetic clades using discriminatively trained profile hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for each subtype or clade. ClassyFlu merely requires as input unaligned, full-length or partial HA or NA DNA sequences. It enables rapid and highly accurate assignment of HA sequences to subtypes H1-H17 but particularly focusses on the finer grained assignment of sequences of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 according to the cladistics proposed by the H5N1 Evolution Working Group. NA sequences are classified into subtypes N1-N10. ClassyFlu was compared to semiautomatic classification approaches using BLAST and phylogenetics and additionally for H5 sequences to the new "Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Clade Classification Tool" (IRD-CT) proposed by the Influenza Research Database. Our results show that both web tools (ClassyFlu and IRD-CT), although based on different methods, are nearly equivalent in performance and both are more accurate and faster than semiautomatic classification. A retraining of ClassyFlu to altered cladistics as well as an extension of ClassyFlu to other IAV genome segments or fragments thereof is undemanding. This is exemplified by unambiguous assignment to a distinct cluster within subtype H7 of sequences of H7N9 viruses which emerged in China early in 2013 and caused more than 130 human infections. http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/ClassyFlu is a free web service. For local execution, the ClassyFlu source code in PERL is freely available.

Title: A historical perspective of influenza A(H1N2) virus.
Abstract: The emergence and transition to pandemic status of the influenza A(H1N1)A(H1N1)pdm09) virus in 2009 illustrated the potential for previously circulating human viruses to re-emerge in humans and cause a pandemic after decades of circulating among animals. Within a short time of the initial emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, novel reassortants were isolated from swine. In late 2011, a variant (v) H3N2 subtype was isolated from humans, and by 2012, the number of persons infected began to increase with limited person-to-person transmission. During 2012 in the United States, an A(H1N2)v virus was transmitted to humans from swine. During the same year, Australia recorded its first H1N2 subtype infection among swine. The A(H3N2)v and A(H1N2)v viruses contained the matrix protein from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, raising the possibility of increased transmissibility among humans and underscoring the potential for influenza pandemics of novel swine-origin viruses. We report on the differing histories of A(H1N2) viruses among humans and animals.

Title: Impact of viral drift on vaccination dynamics and patterns of seasonal influenza.
Abstract: Much research has been devoted to the determination of optimal vaccination strategies for seasonal influenza epidemics. However, less attention has been paid to whether this optimization can be achieved within the context of viral drift. We developed a mathematical model that links different intra-seasonal dynamics of vaccination and infection to investigate the effect of viral drift on optimal vaccination for minimizing the total number of infections. The model was computationally implemented using a seasonal force of infection, with estimated parameters from the published literature. Simulation results show that the pattern of large seasonal epidemics is strongly correlated with the duration of specific cross-protection immunity induced by natural infection. Considering a random vaccination, our simulations suggest that the effect of vaccination on epidemic patterns is largely influenced by the duration of protection induced by strain-specific vaccination. We found that the protection efficacy (i.e., reduction of susceptibility to infection) of vaccine is a parameter that could influence these patterns, particularly when the duration of vaccine-induced cross-protection is lengthened. Given the uncertainty in the timing and nature of antigenically drifted variants, the findings highlight the difficulty in determining optimal vaccination dynamics for seasonal epidemics. Our study suggests that the short- and long-term impacts of vaccination on seasonal epidemics should be evaluated within the context of population-pathogen landscape for influenza evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on mathematical modeling of vaccination dynamics and viral drift effects on epidemic patterns, without direct experimental or observational links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The macrophage galactose-type lectin can function as an attachment and entry receptor for influenza virus.
Abstract: Specific protein receptors that mediate internalization and entry of influenza A virus (IAV) have not been identified for any cell type. Sialic acid (SIA), the primary attachment factor for IAV hemagglutinin, is expressed by numerous cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, confounding efforts to identify specific receptors involved in virus infection. Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) epithelial cells express cell surface SIA and bind IAV yet are largely resistant to infection. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the murine macrophage galactose-type lectin 1 (MGL1) by Lec1 cells enhanced Ca(2+)-dependent IAV binding and restored permissivity to infection. Lec1 cells expressing MGL1 were infected in the presence or absence of cell surface SIA, indicating that MGL1 can act as a primary receptor or as a coreceptor with SIA. Lec1 cells expressing endocytosis-deficient MGL1 mediated Ca(2+)-dependent IAV binding but were less sensitive to IAV infection, indicating that direct internalization via MGL1 can result in cellular infection. Together, these studies identify MGL1 as a cell surface glycoprotein that can act as an authentic receptor for both attachment and infectious entry of IAV.

Title: Molecular epidemiology of influenza A virus infection in Cyprus in four consecutive seasons (2009 pandemic-2013).
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of influenza A virus infection in Cyprus from the 2009 pandemic until 2013. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus infections outnumbered infections with other respiratory viruses until the end of 2009. The pandemic virus was also the prevalent influenza strain during influenza season 2010-2011; however, it was completely replaced by H3N2 subtype in the next season. During the most recent influenza season, 2012-2013, the pandemic strain was once again the only influenza A virus circulating in Cyprus. Full-length neuraminidase gene sequencing revealed mutations that had previously been identified as permissive. No significant difference in the expression of the IFN-inducible genes OAS and IFIT1 were observed. The phylogenetic analysis of the neuraminidase gene sequences revealed a picture of continuous importation of influenza strains in the island of Cyprus with local circulation playing only a minor role in determining the prevalent strain of the next influenza season.

Reason: The study focuses on molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of influenza A virus strains in Cyprus, with no explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Population susceptibility to North American and Eurasian swine influenza viruses in England, at three time points between 2004 and 2011.
Abstract: Age-stratified sera collected in 2004, 2008 and 2010 in England were evaluated for antibody to swine influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses from the United States or Europe as a measure of population susceptibility to the emergence of novel viruses. Children under 11 years of age had little or no measurable antibody to recent swine H3N2 viruses despite their high levels of antibody to recent H3N2 seasonal human strains. Adolescents and young adults (born 1968–1999) had higher antibody levels to swine H3N2 viruses. Antibody levels to swine H3N2 influenza show little correlation with exposure to recent seasonal H3N2 (A/Perth/16/2009) strains, but with antibody to older H3N2 strains represented by A/Wuhan/359/1995. Children had the highest seropositivity to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and young adults had the lowest antibody levels to A/Perth/16/2009. No age group showed substantial antibody levels to A/Aragon/RR3218/2008, a European swine H1N1 virus belonging to the Eurasian lineage. After vaccination with contemporary trivalent vaccine we observed evidence of boosted reactivity to swine H3N2 viruses in children and adults, while only a limited boosting effect on antibody levels to A/Aragon/RR3218/2008 was observed in both groups. Overall, our results suggest that different vaccination strategies may be necessary according to age if swine viruses emerge as a significant pandemic threat.

Title: Effectiveness of influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza, in the late 2011-2012 season in Spain, among population targeted for vaccination.
Abstract: In Spain, the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated in the last three seasons using the observational study cycEVA conducted in the frame of the existing Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System. The objective of the study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) among the target groups for vaccination in Spain in the 2011-2012 season. We also studied influenza VE in the early (weeks 52/2011-7/2012) and late (weeks 8-14/2012) phases of the epidemic and according to time since vaccination. Medically attended patients with ILI were systematically swabbed to collect information on exposure, laboratory outcome and confounding factors. Patients belonging to target groups for vaccination and who were swabbed <8 days after symptom onset were included. Cases tested positive for influenza and controls tested negative for any influenza virus. To examine the effect of a late season, analyses were performed according to the phase of the season and according to the time between vaccination and symptoms onset. The overall adjusted influenza VE against A(H3N2) was 45% (95% CI, 0-69). The estimated influenza VE was 52% (95% CI, -3 to 78), 40% (95% CI, -40 to 74) and 22% (95% CI, -135 to 74) at 3.5 months, 3.5-4 months, and >4 months, respectively, since vaccination. A decrease in VE with time since vaccination was only observed in individuals aged ≥ 65 years. Regarding the phase of the season, decreasing point estimates were only observed in the early phase, whereas very low or null estimates were obtained in the late phase for the shortest time interval. The 2011-2012 influenza vaccine showed a low-to-moderate protective effect against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in the target groups for vaccination, in a late season and with a limited match between the vaccine and circulating strains. The suggested decrease in influenza VE with time since vaccination was mostly observed in the elderly population. The decreasing protective effect of the vaccine in the late part of the season could be related to waning vaccine protection because no viral changes were identified throughout the season.

Title: Evaluation of three influenza neuraminidase inhibition assays for use in a public health laboratory setting during the 2011-2012 influenza season.
Abstract: We evaluated the implementation of three commercially available neuraminidase inhibition assays in a public health laboratory (PHL) setting. We also described the drug susceptibility patterns of human influenza A and B circulating in Maryland during the 2011-2012 influenza season. From January to May 2012, 169 influenza virus isolates were tested for phenotypic susceptibility to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir using NA-Fluor(TM), NA-Star®, and NA-XTD(TM) concurrently. A 50% neuraminidase inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated to determine drug susceptibility. We used the standard deviation based on the median absolute deviation of the median analysis to determine the potential for reduced drug susceptibility. We evaluated each assay for the use of resources in high- and low-volume testing scenarios. One of the 25 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic isolates tested was resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir, and sensitive to zanamivir, on all three platforms. Eighty-two influenza A (H3N2) and 62 B isolates were sensitive to all three drugs in all three assays. For a low-volume scenario, NA-Star and NA-XTD took 120 minutes to complete, while NA-Fluor required 300 minutes to complete. The lowest relative cost favored NA-Star. In a high-volume scenario, NA-Fluor had the highest throughput. Reagent use was most efficient when maximizing throughput. Cost efficiency from low- to high-volume testing improved the most for NA-Star. Our evaluation showed that both chemiluminescent and fluorescent neuraminidase inhibition assays can be successfully implemented in a PHL setting to screen circulating influenza strains for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. For improved PHL influenza surveillance, it may be essential to develop guidelines for phenotypic drug-resistance testing that take into consideration a PHL's workload and available resources.

Title: Decrease of virus receptors during highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection in humans and other mammals.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus causes a severe, often fatal, pneumonia in humans. The tropism and pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus can partly be explained by the presence of H5N1 virus receptors in the human alveoli, which are the site of inflammation during pneumonia. Although studies on the distribution of influenza virus receptors in normal respiratory tract tissues have provided significant insights into the cell tropism and pathogenesis of influenza viruses, the distribution of influenza virus receptors have not been studied during influenza virus infection. Therefore, we studied the distribution of H5N1 virus receptors, by virus and lectin histochemistry, during highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection in alveolar tissues of humans, macaques, ferrets, and cats. In all species, we observed a decrease of H5N1 virus receptors in influenza virus-infected and neighboring cells. The observed decrease of H5N1 virus receptors was associated with the presence of MxA, a known marker for interferon activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the decrease of H5N1 virus receptors might be part of a defense mechanism that limits viral replication in the lower respiratory tract.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of influenza virus co-infections in humans and changes in the genetic variability of A(H3N2) virus strains in southern Italy from 1999 to 2009. A partial sequence of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene by human influenza H3N2 strains identified in oropharyngeal swabs from patients with influenza-like illness was analysed by DNA sequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. During the seasons 1999-2000, 2002-2003, 2004-2005 and 2008-2009, the influenza viruses circulating belonged to subtype H3N2. However, A(H1N1) subtype virus and B type were respectively prevalent during the 2000-2001, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006 seasons. The HA sequences appeared to be closely related to the sequence of the influenza A vaccine strain. Only the 2002-2003 season was characterized by co-circulation of two viral lineages: A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like virus of the previous season and A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like virus, a new H3 variant. In this study, over the decade analysed, no significant change was seen in the sequences of the HA gene of H3 viruses isolated.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) virus in poultry workers, Mexico, 2012.
Abstract: We identified 2 poultry workers with conjunctivitis caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) viruses in Jalisco, Mexico. Genomic and antigenic analyses of 1 isolate indicated relatedness to poultry and wild bird subtype H7N3 viruses from North America. This isolate had a multibasic cleavage site that might have been derived from recombination with host rRNA.

Title: Antigen-activated dendritic cells ameliorate influenza A infections.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need for alternative or adjunct therapies, as resistance to currently used antiviral drugs is emerging rapidly. We tested ligand epitope antigen presentation system (LEAPS) technology as a new immune-based treatment for influenza virus infection in a mouse model. Influenza-J-LEAPS peptides were synthesized by conjugating the binding ligand derived from the β2-microglobulin chain of the human MHC class I molecule (J-LEAPS) with 15 to 30 amino acid-long peptides derived from influenza virus NP, M, or HA proteins. DCs were stimulated with influenza-J-LEAPS peptides (influenza-J-LEAPS) and injected intravenously into infected mice. Antigen-specific LEAPS-stimulated DCs were effective in reducing influenza virus replication in the lungs and enhancing survival of infected animals. Additionally, they augmented influenza-specific T cell responses in the lungs and reduced the severity of disease by limiting excessive cytokine responses, which are known to contribute to morbidity and mortality following influenza virus infection. Our data demonstrate that influenza-J-LEAPS-pulsed DCs reduce virus replication in the lungs, enhance survival, and modulate the protective immune responses that eliminate the virus while preventing excessive cytokines that could injure the host. This approach shows promise as an adjunct to antiviral treatment of influenza virus infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on immune therapy using dendritic cells and does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Epidemiology of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus during 2009-2010 in Taiwan.
Abstract: Outbreak of swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (pdmH1N1) occurred in 2009. Taiwanese authorities implemented nationwide vaccinations with pdmH1N1-specific inactivated vaccine as of November 2009. This study evaluates prevalence, HA phylogenetic relationship, and transmission dynamic of influenza A and B viruses in Taiwan in 2009-2010. Respiratory tract specimens were analyzed for influenza A and B viruses. The pdmH1N1 peaked in November 2009, was predominant from August 2009 to January 2010, then sharply dropped in February 2010. Significant prevalence peaks of influenza B in April-June of 2010 and H3N2 virus in July and August were observed. Highest percentage of pdmH1N1- and H3N2-positive cases appeared among 11-15-year-olds; influenza B-positive cases were dominant among those 6-10 years old. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees showed 11 unique clusters of pdmH1N1, seasonal H3N2 influenza A and B viruses, as well as transmission clusters and mixed infections of influenza strains in Taiwan. The 2009 pdmH1N1 virus was predominant in Taiwan from August 2009 to January 2010; seasonal H3N2 influenza A and B viruses exhibited small prevalence peaks after nationwide vaccinations. Phylogenetic evidence indicated transmission clusters and multiple independent clades of co-circulating influenza A and B strains in Taiwan.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on epidemiology, prevalence, and phylogenetic relationships without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Increased transmissibility explains the third wave of infection by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus in England.
Abstract: In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the United Kingdom experienced two waves of infection, the first in the late spring and the second in the autumn. Given the low level of susceptibility to the pandemic virus expected to be remaining in the population after the second wave, it was a surprise that a substantial third epidemic occurred in the UK population between November 2010 and February 2011, despite no evidence for any significant antigenic evolution of the pandemic virus. Here, we use a mathematical model of influenza transmission embedded within a Bayesian synthesis inferential framework to jointly analyze syndromic, virological, and serological surveillance data collected in England in 2009-2011 and thereby assess epidemiological mechanisms which might have generated the third wave. We find that substantially increased transmissibility of the H1N1pdm09 virus is required to reproduce the third wave, suggesting that the virus evolved and increased fitness in the human host by the end of 2010, or that the very cold weather experienced in the United Kingdom at that time enhanced transmission rates. We also find some evidence that the preexisting heterologous immunity which reduced attack rates in adults during 2009 had substantially decayed by the winter of 2010, thus increasing the susceptibility of the adult population to infection. Finally, our analysis suggests that a pandemic vaccination campaign targeting adults and school-age children could have mitigated or prevented the third wave even at moderate levels of coverage.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study uses mathematical modeling to explain epidemiological patterns without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza risk management: lessons learned from an A(H1N1) pdm09 outbreak investigation in an operational military setting.
Abstract: At the onset of an influenza pandemic, when the severity of a novel strain is still undetermined and there is a threat of introduction into a new environment, e.g., via the deployment of military troops, sensitive screening criteria and conservative isolation practices are generally recommended. In response to elevated rates of influenza-like illness among U.S. military base camps in Kuwait, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 partnered with local U.S. Army medical units to conduct an A(H1N1) pdm09 outbreak investigation. Initial clinical data and nasal specimens were collected via the existent passive surveillance system and active surveillance was conducted using a modified version of the World Health Organization/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness case definition [fever (T > 100.5˚F/38˚C) in addition to cough and/or sore throat in the previous 72 hours] as the screening criteria. Samples were tested via real-time reverse-transcription PCR and sequenced for comparison to global A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses from the same time period. The screening criteria used in Kuwait proved insensitive, capturing only 16% of A(H1N1) pdm09-positive individuals. While still not ideal, using cough as the sole screening criteria would have increased sensitivity to 73%. The results of and lessons learned from this outbreak investigation suggest that pandemic influenza risk management should be a dynamic process (as information becomes available regarding true attack rates and associated mortality, screening and isolation criteria should be re-evaluated and revised as appropriate), and that military operational environments present unique challenges to influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on outbreak investigation, surveillance, and screening criteria without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: A high diversity of Eurasian lineage low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses circulate among wild birds sampled in Egypt.
Abstract: Surveillance for influenza A viruses in wild birds has increased substantially as part of efforts to control the global movement of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Studies conducted in Egypt from 2003 to 2007 to monitor birds for H5N1 identified multiple subtypes of low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses isolated primarily from migratory waterfowl collected in the Nile Delta. Phylogenetic analysis of 28 viral genomes was performed to estimate their nearest ancestors and identify possible reassortants. Migratory flyway patterns were included in the analysis to assess gene flow between overlapping flyways. Overall, the viruses were most closely related to Eurasian, African and/or Central Asian lineage low pathogenicity viruses and belonged to 15 different subtypes. A subset of the internal genes seemed to originate from specific flyways (Black Sea-Mediterranean, East African-West Asian). The remaining genes were derived from a mixture of viruses broadly distributed across as many as 4 different flyways suggesting the importance of the Nile Delta for virus dispersal. Molecular clock date estimates suggested that the time to the nearest common ancestor of all viruses analyzed ranged from 5 to 10 years, indicating frequent genetic exchange with viruses sampled elsewhere. The intersection of multiple migratory bird flyways and the resulting diversity of influenza virus gene lineages in the Nile Delta create conditions favoring reassortment, as evident from the gene constellations identified by this study. In conclusion, we present for the first time a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating in Egypt, underscoring the significance of the region for viral reassortment and the potential emergence of novel avian influenza A viruses, as well as representing a highly diverse influenza A virus gene pool that merits continued monitoring.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study is a phylogenetic analysis of viral diversity and reassortment without explicit links between genotype and phenotype.

Title: Geographical distribution of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses of domestic poultry in Vietnam and their genetic relevance with Asian isolates.
Abstract: From the avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks and market surveillances in Vietnam during November 2011 and March 2012, a total of 196 AIV were isolated. Although H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was the most prevalent subtype in Vietnam, 57 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were identified from mainly domestic ducks and some chickens. Of note, various subtypes of LPAI viruses were isolated from domestic ducks in Vietnam: H3 (n = 16), H4 (n = 4), H6 (n = 24), H7 (n = 1), and H9 (n = 10). Geographically, the LPAI viruses were identified in different regions of Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes in LPAIV in Vietnam showed that some H3 (group I) and H4 subtypes AIV clustered with the viruses of several Asian isolates from domestic poultry and wild birds. However, the H6, H9, and some H3 (group II and III) subtypes AIV were closely related to isolates from domestic poultry in Southern China. In addition, whereas the N2 and N6 subtypes AIV belonged to the Eurasian lineage, the N8 subtype AIV was classified to be both of Eurasian and American lineage. These findings revealed that the regional trade and wild birds play a key role transmission of LPAIV in domestic ducks in Vietnam. Further surveillance at the intercountry level is needed to understand the epidemiology of these viruses and to cope with emergence of novel AIV types.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on geographic distribution and genetic relationships of viruses without explicit phenotype characterization.

Title: The recent establishment of North American H10 lineage influenza viruses in Australian wild waterfowl and the evolution of Australian avian influenza viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A H10N7 virus with a hemagglutinin gene of North American origin was detected in Australian chickens and poultry abattoir workers in New South Wales, Australia, in 2010 and in chickens in Queensland, Australia, on a mixed chicken and domestic duck farm in 2012. We investigated their genomic origins by sequencing full and partial genomes of H10 viruses isolated from wild aquatic birds and poultry in Australia and analyzed them with all available avian influenza virus sequences from Oceania and representative viruses from North America and Eurasia. Our analysis showed that the H10N7 viruses isolated from poultry were similar to those that have been circulating since 2009 in Australian aquatic birds and that their initial transmission into Australia occurred during 2007 and 2008. The H10 viruses that appear to have developed endemicity in Australian wild aquatic birds were derived from several viruses circulating in waterfowl along various flyways. Their hemagglutinin gene was derived from aquatic birds in the western states of the United States, whereas the neuraminidase was closely related to that from viruses previously detected in waterfowl in Japan. The remaining genes were derived from Eurasian avian influenza virus lineages. Our analysis of virological data spanning 40 years in Oceania indicates that the long-term evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses in Australia may be determined by climatic changes. The introduction and long-term persistence of avian influenza virus lineages were observed during periods with increased rainfall, whereas bottlenecks and extinction were observed during phases of widespread decreases in rainfall. These results extend our understanding of factors affecting the dynamics of avian influenza and provide important considerations for surveillance and disease control strategies.
Relevant: False

Title: Influenza viruses: breaking all the rules.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant pathogens able to repeatedly switch hosts to infect multiple avian and mammalian species, including humans. The unpredictability of IAV evolution and interspecies movement creates continual public health challenges, such as the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus from swine, as well as pandemic threats from the ongoing H5N1 and the recent H7N9 epizootics. In the last decade there has been increased concern about the "dual use" nature of microbiology, and a set of guidelines covering "dual use research of concern" includes seven categories of potentially problematic scientific experiments. In this Perspective, we consider how in nature IAV continually undergo "dual use experiments" as a matter of evolution and selection, and we conclude that studying these properties of IAV is critical for mitigating and preventing future epidemics and pandemics.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a perspective article discussing influenza virus evolution and research importance, without explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Characterization of the upper respiratory tract microbiomes of patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza.
Abstract: The upper respiratory tract microbiome has an important role in respiratory health. Influenza A is a common viral infection that challenges that health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia. Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics. We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60 universal target amplification and sequencing. Profiles were examined at the phylum and nearest neighbor "species" levels using the characteristics of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences. At the nearest neighbor "species" level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 "species" and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age. Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota. A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables. To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study. A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute bacterial quantification was observed. This study represents the first examination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome using a target other than the 16S rRNA gene and to our knowledge, the first thorough examination of this microbiome during a viral infection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes microbiomes in influenza patients without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: H7N9 avian influenza A virus and the perpetual challenge of potential human pandemicity.
Abstract: ABSTRACT The ongoing H7N9 influenza epizootic in China once again presents us questions about the origin of pandemics and how to recognize them in early stages of development. Over the past ~135 years, H7 influenza viruses have neither caused pandemics nor been recognized as having undergone human adaptation. Yet several unusual properties of these viruses, including their poultry epizootic potential, mammalian adaptation, and atypical clinical syndromes in rarely infected humans, suggest that they may be different from other avian influenza viruses, thus questioning any assurance that the likelihood of human adaptation is low. At the same time, the H7N9 epizootic provides an opportunity to learn more about the mammalian/human adaptational capabilities of avian influenza viruses and challenges us to integrate virologic and public health research and surveillance at the animal-human interface.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a review discussing potential human pandemicity of H7N9 viruses, focusing on general properties and surveillance rather than explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: Conjugation to polymeric chains of influenza drugs targeting M2 ion channels partially restores inhibition of drug-resistant mutants.
Abstract: By attaching multiple copies of the influenza M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine (1) and rimantadine (2) to polymeric chains, we endeavored to recover their potency in inhibiting drug-resistant influenza viruses. Depending on loading densities, as well as the nature of the drug, the polymer, and the spacer arm, polymer-conjugated drugs were up to 30-fold more potent inhibitors of drug-resistant strains than their monomeric parents. In particular, a 20% loading density and a short linker group on the negatively charged poly-l-glutamate resulted in one of the most potent inhibitors for 2's conjugates against drug-resistant influenza strains. Although full recovery of the inhibitory action against drug-resistant strains was not achieved, this study may be a step toward salvaging anti-influenza drugs that are no longer effective.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on drug conjugates to restore inhibition of drug-resistant mutants but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Palmitoylation on conserved and nonconserved cysteines of murine IFITM1 regulates its stability and anti-influenza A virus activity.
Abstract: The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infection by numerous viruses, yet the importance and regulation of individual isoforms remains unclear. Here, we report that murine IFITM1 (mIFITM1) is palmitoylated on one nonconserved cysteine and three conserved cysteines that are required for anti-influenza A virus activity. Additionally, palmitoylation of mIFITM1 regulates protein stability by preventing proteasomal degradation, and modification of the nonconserved cysteine at the mIFITM1 C terminus supports an intramembrane topology with mechanistic implications.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on palmitoylation of IFITM1 protein and its effect on anti-influenza activity, not on viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: [Phylogenetic analysis and genotyping of A/H3N2 Influenza viruses isolated from patients hospitalised with influenza-like illness symptoms in the na bulovce hospital in the season 2011/2012].
Abstract: Influenza A virus is an important cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Clinical manifestations of ARI vary from mild or moderate to life-threatening conditions requiring intensive care. Given the segmented genome, a large natural reservoir of other influenza virus subtypes, and antibody selection pressure in the population, the virus is variable and genetically unstable. The phylogenetic analysis and genotyping of A/H3N2 influenza viruses isolated from patients hospitalised with influenza-like illness symptoms in the Na Bulovce Hospital in the season 2011/2012 support the assumption that the pathogenicity is a polygenic trait modifiable by the host health status and seems not to be unambiguously associated with any specific mutations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports phylogenetic analysis and genotyping but concludes pathogenicity is polygenic and not unambiguously linked to specific mutations.

Title: A global model of avian influenza prediction in wild birds: the importance of northern regions.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is enzootic to wild birds, which are its natural reservoir. The virus exhibits a large degree of genetic diversity and most of the isolated strains are of low pathogenicity to poultry. Although AIV is nearly ubiquitous in wild bird populations, highly pathogenic H5N1 subtypes in poultry have been the focus of most modeling efforts. To better understand viral ecology of AIV, a predictive model should 1) include wild birds, 2) include all isolated subtypes, and 3) cover the host's natural range, unbounded by artificial country borders. As of this writing, there are few large-scale predictive models of AIV in wild birds. We used the Random Forests algorithm, an ensemble data-mining machine-learning method, to develop a global-scale predictive map of AIV, identify important predictors, and describe the environmental niche of AIV in wild bird populations. The model has an accuracy of 0.79 and identified northern areas as having the highest relative predicted risk of outbreak. The primary niche was described as regions of low annual rainfall and low temperatures. This study is the first global-scale model of low-pathogenicity avian influenza in wild birds and underscores the importance of largely unstudied northern regions in the persistence of AIV.

Reason: The paper presents a predictive ecological model of avian influenza occurrence in wild birds, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Intranasal immunization of baculovirus displayed hemagglutinin confers complete protection against mouse adapted highly pathogenic H7N7 reassortant influenza virus.
Abstract: Avian influenza A H7N7 virus poses a pandemic threat to human health because of its ability for direct transmission from domestic poultry to humans and from human to human. The wide zoonotic potential of H7N7 combined with an antiviral immunity inhibition similar to pandemic 1918 H1N1 and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses is disconcerting and increases the risk of a putative H7N7 pandemic in the future, underlining the urgent need for vaccine development against this virus. In this study, we developed a recombinant vaccine by expressing the H7N7-HA protein on the surface of baculovirus (Bac-HA). The protective efficacy of the live Bac-HA vaccine construct was evaluated in a mouse model by challenging mice immunized intranasally (i.n.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) with high pathogenic mouse adapted H7N7 reassorted strain. Although s.c. injection of live Bac-HA induced higher specific IgG than i.n. immunization, the later resulted in an elevated neutralization titer. Interestingly, 100% protection from the lethal viral challenge was only observed for the mice immunized intranasally with live Bac-HA, whereas no protection was achieved in any other s.c. or i.n. immunized mice groups. In addition, we also observed higher mucosal IgA as well as increased IFN-γ and IL-4 responses in the splenocytes of the surviving mice coupled with a reduced viral titer and diminished histopathological signs in the lungs. Our results indicated that protection from high pathogenic H7N7 (NL/219/03) virus requires both mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice. The balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines is also required for the protection against the H7N7 pathogen. Intranasal administration of live Bac-HA induced all these immune responses and protected the mice from lethal viral challenge. Therefore, live Bac-HA is an effective vaccine candidate against H7N7 viral infections.

Title: Influenza activity--United States, 2012-13 season and composition of the 2013-14 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2012-13 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity* increased through November and December before peaking in late December. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated overall, but influenza B viruses and, to a lesser extent, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) viruses also were reported in the United States. This influenza season was moderately severe, with a higher percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), higher rates of hospitalization, and more reported deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza compared with recent years. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2012-13 influenza season (September 30, 2012-May 18, 2013) as of June 7, 2013, and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2013-14 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: The autoimmune basis of narcolepsy.
Abstract: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagonic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed nocturnal sleep patterns. Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin (orexin)-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Evidence, such as a strong association with HLA DQB1*06:02, strongly suggests an autoimmune basis targeting hypocretin neurons. Genome-wide association studies have strengthened the association between narcolepsy and immune system gene polymorphisms, including the identification of polymorphisms in the T cell receptor alpha locus, TNFSF4 (also called OX40L), Cathepsin H (CTSH) the purinergic receptor P2RY11, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Recently, attention has been raised regarding a spike in cases of childhood narcolepsy in 2010 following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) in China and vaccination with Pandemrix, an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine that was used in Europe. How the immune system may be involved in disease initiation and/or progression remains a challenge to researchers. Potential immunological pathways that could lead to the specific elimination of hypocretin producing neurons include molecular mimicry or bystander activation, and are likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as upper airway infections.

Title: A plant extract of Ribes nigrum folium possesses anti-influenza virus activity in vitro and in vivo by preventing virus entry to host cells.
Abstract: Infections with influenza A viruses (IAV) are still amongst the major causes of highly contagious severe respiratory diseases not only bearing a devastating effect to human health, but also significantly impact the economy. Besides vaccination that represents the best option to protect from IAV infections, only two classes of anti-influenza drugs, inhibitors of the M2 ion channel and the neuraminidase, often causing resistant IAV variants have been approved. That is why the need for effective and amply available antivirals against IAV is of high priority. Here we introduce LADANIA067 from the leaves of the wild black currant (Ribes nigrum folium) as a potent compound against IAV infections in vitro and in vivo. LADANIA067 treatment resulted in a reduction of progeny virus titers in cell cultures infected with prototype avian and human influenza virus strains of different subtypes. At the effective dose of 100 µg/ml the extract did not exhibit apparent harming effects on cell viability, metabolism or proliferation. Further, viruses showed no tendency to develop resistance to LADANIA067 when compared to amantadine that resulted in the generation of resistant variants after only a few passages. On a molecular basis the protective effect of LADANIA067 appears to be mainly due to interference with virus internalisation. In the mouse infection model LADANIA067 treatment reduces progeny virus titers in the lung upon intranasal application. In conclusion, an extract from the leaves of the wild black currant might be a promising source for the development of new antiviral compounds to fight IAV infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: Focuses on antiviral activity of a plant extract against influenza virus, without explicit discussion of viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Influenza (H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were prevalent during 2004-2005 and 2009-2012, respectively. Genetic and epidemiologic analyses of human and swine influenza viruses indicated 2 events of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus spillover from humans to pigs.

Title: Towards multiscale modeling of influenza infection.
Abstract: Aided by recent advances in computational power, algorithms, and higher fidelity data, increasingly detailed theoretical models of infection with influenza A virus are being developed. We review single scale models as they describe influenza infection from intracellular to global scales, and, in particular, we consider those models that capture details specific to influenza and can be used to link different scales. We discuss the few multiscale models of influenza infection that have been developed in this emerging field. In addition to discussing modeling approaches, we also survey biological data on influenza infection and transmission that is relevant for constructing influenza infection models. We envision that, in the future, multiscale models that capitalize on technical advances in experimental biology and high performance computing could be used to describe the large spatial scale epidemiology of influenza infection, evolution of the virus, and transmission between hosts more accurately.

Title: Molecular assays for quantitative and qualitative detection of influenza virus and oseltamivir resistance mutations.
Abstract: Sensitive and reproducible molecular assays are essential for influenza virus diagnostics. This manuscript describes the design, validation, and evaluation of a set of real-time RT-PCR assays for quantification and subtyping of human influenza viruses from patient respiratory material. Four assays are included for detection of oseltamivir resistance mutations H275Y in prepandemic and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and E119V and R292K in influenza A/H3N2 neuraminidase. The lower limits of detection of the quantification assay were determined to be 1.7 log(10) virus particles per milliliter (vp/mL) for influenza A and 2.2 log(10) vp/mL for influenza B virus. The lower limits of quantification were 2.1 and 2.3 log(10) vp/mL, respectively. The RT-PCR efficiencies and lower limits of detection of the quantification assays were only marginally affected when tested on the most dissimilar target sequences found in the GenBank database. Finally, the resistance RT-PCR assays detected at least 5% mutant viruses present in mixtures containing both wild-type and mutant viruses with approximated limits of detection of 2.4 log(10) vp/mL. Overall, this set of RT-PCR assays is a powerful tool for enhanced influenza virus surveillance.

Title: Nox1 oxidase suppresses influenza a virus-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection is an ongoing clinical problem and thus, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms that regulate the lung inflammation in order to unravel novel generic pharmacological strategies. Evidence indicates that the Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase enzyme promotes influenza A virus-induced lung oxidative stress, inflammation and dysfunction via ROS generation. In addition, lung epithelial and endothelial cells express the Nox1 isoform of NADPH oxidase, placing this enzyme at key sites to regulate influenza A virus-induced lung inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Nox1 oxidase regulates the inflammatory response and the oxidative stress to influenza infection in vivo in mice. Male WT and Nox1-deficient (Nox1(-/y)) mice were infected with the moderately pathogenic HkX-31 (H3N2, 1×10(4) PFU) influenza A virus for analysis of bodyweight, airways inflammation, oxidative stress, viral titre, lung histopathology, and cytokine/chemokine expression at 3 and 7 days post infection. HkX-31 virus infection of Nox1(-/y) mice resulted in significantly greater: loss of bodyweight (Day 3); BALF neutrophilia, peri-bronchial, peri-vascular and alveolar inflammation; Nox2-dependent inflammatory cell ROS production and peri-bronchial, epithelial and endothelial oxidative stress. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, GM-CSF and TNF-α was higher in Nox1(-/y) lungs compared to WT mice at Day 3, however, the expression of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, IFN-γ and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were lower in lungs of Nox1(-/y) mice vs. WT mice at Day 7. Lung viral titre, and airways infiltration of active CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and of Tregs were similar between WT and Nox1(-/y) mice. In conclusion, Nox1 oxidase suppresses influenza A virus induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in mice particularly at the early phases of the infection. Nox1 and Nox2 oxidases appear to have opposing roles in the regulation of inflammation caused by influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host Nox1 oxidase effects on influenza-induced inflammation but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Molecular and epidemiological characterization of avian influenza viruses from gulls and dabbling ducks in Norway.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds constitute the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Separate Eurasian and American AIV gene pools exist. Here, the prevalence and diversity of AIVs in gulls and dabbling ducks in Norway were described. The influence of host species and temporal changes on AIV prevalence was examined. Five AIVs from Norway, including three from common gull (Larus canus), were analyzed along with 10 available AIV genomes from gulls in Eurasia to search for evidence of intracontinental and intercontinental reassortment of gene segments encoding the internal viral proteins. Swabs collected from 2417 dabbling ducks and gulls in the south-west of Norway during five ordinary hunting seasons (August-December) in the period 2005-2010 were analyzed for presence of AIV. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify associations between AIV prevalence, host species and sampling time. Five AIVs from mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (H3N8, H9N2) and common gull (H6N8, H13N2, H16N3) were full-length characterized and phylogenetically analyzed together with GenBank reference sequences. Low pathogenic AIVs were detected in 15.5% (CI: 14.1-17.0) of the samples. The overall AIV prevalence was lower in December compared to that found in August to November (p = 0.003). AIV was detected in 18.7% (CI: 16.8-20.6) of the dabbling ducks. A high AIV prevalence of 7.8% (CI; 5.9-10.0) was found in gulls. A similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence was found in both bird groups. Thirteen hemagglutinin and eight neuraminidase subtypes were detected. No evidence of intercontinental reassortment was found. Eurasian avian (non H13 and H16) PB2 or PA genes were identified in five reference Eurasian gull (H13 and H16) AIV genomes from GenBank. The NA gene from the Norwegian H13N2 gull isolate was of Eurasian avian origin. The similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence found in dabbling ducks and gulls, the relatively high virus prevalence detected in gulls and the evidence of intracontinental reassortment in AIVs from gulls indicate that gulls that interact with dabbling ducks are likely to be mixing vessels for AIVs from waterfowl and gulls. Our results support that intercontinental reassortment is rare in AIVs from gulls in Eurasia.

Title: Tools to detect influenza virus.
Abstract: In 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1 09) started to spread quickly in many countries. It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.

Reason: The paper reviews diagnostic tools for influenza virus detection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The role of polymorphisms in host immune genes in determining the severity of respiratory illness caused by pandemic H1N1 influenza.
Abstract: Following the influenza epidemics, it has become clear that severity of illness is not uniform. Comorbidities and immunocompromise account for only a fraction of severe cases and do not explain the differential severity among the otherwise healthy during pandemics. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a focus has been placed on better understanding of the determinants and pathogenesis of severe influenza infections. Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly within the H1N1 pandemic). The improved understanding of the cellular mechanisms and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of severe disease along with technological advances have allowed a more systematic approach to the exploration of the host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severe respiratory illness. By better defining the role of genetic variability in the immune responses to influenza, and identifying key polymorphisms that either protect against severe manifestation or those that impair the host immune response, it is possible to envision better methods to identify at-risk populations and new targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines. This review will summarize the accumulated literature examining the immunogenetic factors associated with propensity for the development of severe pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) manifestations. We will focus on novel and key insights gained through study of ethnic populations that appeared more vulnerable to severe disease during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Title: The differential antiviral activities of chicken interferon α (ChIFN-α) and ChIFN-β are related to distinct interferon-stimulated gene expression.
Abstract: Chicken interferon α (ChIFN-α) and ChIFN-β are type I IFNs that are important antiviral cytokines in the innate immune system. In the present study, we identified the virus-induced expression of ChIFN-α and ChIFN-β in chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells and systematically evaluated the antiviral activities of recombinant ChIFN-α and ChIFN-β by cytopathic-effect (CPE) inhibition assays. We found that ChIFN-α exhibited stronger antiviral activity than ChIFN-β in terms of inhibiting the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza virus, respectively. To elucidate the mechanism of differential antiviral activities between the two ChIFNs, we measured the relative mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in IFN-treated DF-1 cells by real-time PCR. ChIFN-α displayed greater induction potency than ChIFN-β on several ISGs encoding antiviral proteins and MHC-I, whereas ChIFN-α was less potent than ChIFN-β for inducing ISGs involved in signaling pathways. In conclusion, ChIFN-α and ChIFN-β presented differential induction potency on various sets of ISGs, and the stronger antiviral activity of ChIFN-α is likely attributed to the greater expression levels of downstream antiviral ISGs.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies differential antiviral activities of chicken interferons and related gene expression but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus surveillance in wild birds in Georgia: 2009-2011.
Abstract: The Caucasus, at the border of Europe and Asia, is important for migration and over-wintering of wild waterbirds. Three flyways, the Central Asian, East Africa-West Asia, and Mediterranean/Black Sea flyways, converge in the Caucasus region. Thus, the Caucasus region might act as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in the post-breeding, migrating and overwintering periods. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, using five sample areas geographically spread throughout suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh feces samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 orders of birds, of which 84 were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1.6%. We observed peak prevalence in large gulls during the autumn migration (5.3-9.8%), but peak prevalence in Black-headed Gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed increased AIV prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregations and migration stop-over period (6.3%) but at lower levels to those observed in other more northerly post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the overwintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of a breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive on arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and virologically negative for AIV throughout their time on the breeding grounds, in contrast to gull AIV data from other geographic regions. We show that close phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia are sourced from a wide geographic area throughout Western and Central Eurasia, and from areas that are represented by multiple different flyways, likely linking different host sub-populations.

Title: A subregional analysis of epidemiologic and genetic characteristics of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Africa: Senegal, Cape Verde, Mauritania, and Guinea, 2009-2010.
Abstract: During the pandemic 2009 episode, we conducted laboratory-based surveillance in four countries from West Africa: Senegal, Mauritania, Cape Verde, and Guinea. Specimens were obtained from 3,155 patients: 2,264 patients from Senegal, 498 patients from Cape Verde, 227 patients from Mauritania, and 166 patients from Guinea; 911 (28.9%) patients were positive for influenza, 826 (90.7%) patients were positive for influenza A, and 85 (9.3%) patients were positive for influenza B. Among the influenza A positives, 503 (60.9%) positives were H1N1pdm09, 314 (38.0%) positives were H3N2, and 9 (1.1%) positives were seasonal H1N1. The highest detection rate for seasonal influenza viruses (17.1%) occurred in the 5-14 years age group. However, for A(H1N1)pdm09, the detection rate was highest in the 15-24 years age group (35.8%). Based on the present study data, the timeline of detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in these four countries should be Cape Verde, Guinea, Mauritania, and finally, Senegal. Genetic and antigenic analyses were performed in some isolates.

Title: Expression and distribution of sialic acid influenza virus receptors in wild birds.
Abstract: Avian influenza (AI) viruses have been detected in more than 105 wild bird species from 12 different orders but species-related differences in susceptibility to AI viruses exist. Expression of α2,3-linked (avian-type) and α2,6-linked (human-type) sialic acid (SA) influenza virus receptors in tissues is considered one of the determinants of the host range and tissue tropism of influenza viruses. We investigated the expression of these SA receptors in 37 wild bird species from 11 different orders by lectin histochemistry. Two isoforms of Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectin, MAA1 and MAA2, were used to detect α2,3-linked SA, and Sambucus nigra lectin was used to detect α2,6-linked SA. All species evaluated expressed α2,3-linked and α2,6-linked SA receptors in endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. Both α2,3-linked and α-2,6-linked SA receptors were expressed in respiratory and intestinal tract tissues of aquatic and terrestrial wild bird species from different taxa, but differences in SA expression and in the predominant isoform of MAA lectin bound were observed. With a few possible exceptions, these observed differences were not generally predictive of reported species susceptibility to AI viruses based on published experimental and field data.

Title: Contrasting the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza spatial transmission.
Abstract: In the past decade, rapid increases in the availability of high-resolution molecular and epidemiological data, combined with developments in statistical and computational methods to simulate and infer migration patterns, have provided key insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza A viruses in humans. In this review, we contrast findings from epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission at different spatial scales. We show that findings are broadly consistent in large-scale studies of inter-regional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions, revealing intense epidemics associated with multiple viral introductions, followed by deep troughs driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, aspects of the global transmission dynamics of influenza viruses are still debated, especially with respect to the existence of tropical source populations experiencing high levels of genetic diversity and the extent of prolonged viral persistence between epidemics. At the scale of a country or community, epidemiological studies have revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, which were not identified in molecular studies. We discuss the role of sampling issues in generating these conflicting results, and suggest strategies for future research that may help to fully integrate the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus over space and time.

Reason: This is a review contrasting epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza spatial transmission, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A(H5N1) virus surveillance at live poultry markets, Cambodia, 2011.
Abstract: In Cambodia, influenza A(H5N1) virus surveillance at live poultry markets (LPMs) relies on virus isolation from poultry specimens; however, virus is rarely detected by this method.

Title: Antibody repertoire development in fetal and neonatal piglets. XVI. Influenza stimulates adaptive immunity, class switch and diversification of the IgG repertoire encoded by downstream Cγ genes.
Abstract: Infection of germ-free isolator piglets with swine influenza (S-FLU) that generates dsRNA during replication causes elevation of immunoglobulins in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage, a very weak response to trinitrophenyl conjugates but an immune response to S-FLU. The increased immunoglobulin levels result mainly from the polyclonal activation of B cells during the infection, but model antigen exposure may contribute. The 10-fold increase in local and serum IgG accompanies a 10-fold decrease in the transcription of IgG3 in the tracheal-bronchial lymph nodes and in the ileal Peyer's patches. Infection results in class switch recombination to downstream Cγ genes, which diversify their repertoire; both features are diagnostic of adaptive immunity. Meanwhile the repertoires of IgM and IgG3 remain undiversified suggesting that they encode innate, natural antibodies. Whereas IgG3 may play an initial protective role, antibodies encoded by downstream Cγ genes with diversified repertoires are predicted to be most important in long-term protection against S-FLU.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antibody repertoire development in piglets after influenza infection, describing immune response rather than direct viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenza--future perspectives.
Abstract: Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.

Title: Surveillance for antiviral resistance.
Abstract: In the 10 years since licensure of neuraminidase inhibitor drugs, their use has steadily increased, especially during the pandemic of 2009. Experience now indicates that factors which influence the emergence of high level resistance include the nature of drug binding to target, viral subtype, the use of post exposure prophylaxis and a lack of immunity in the host as seen in children and immunocompromised individuals. These factors point towards targetted surveillance programmes for the early identification of transmissible drug resistance.

Title: Categorical spectral analysis of periodicity in human and viral genomes.
Abstract: Periodicity in nucleotide sequences arises from regular repeating patterns which may reflect important structure and function. Although a three-base periodicity in coding regions has been known for some time and has provided the basis for powerful gene prediction algorithms, its origins are still not fully understood. Here, we show that, contrary to common belief, amino acid (AA) bias and codon usage bias are insufficient to create base-3 periodicity. This article applies the rigorous method of spectral envelope to systematically characterize the contributions of codon bias, AA bias and protein structural motifs to the three-base periodicity of coding sequences. The method is also used to classify CpG islands in the human genome. In addition, we show how spectral envelope can be used to trace the evolution of viral genomes and monitor global sequence changes without having to align to previously known genomes. This approach also detects reassortment events, such as those that led to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus.

Title: Phylogeography of swine influenza H3N2 in the United States: translational public health for zoonotic disease surveillance.
Abstract: The field of phylogeography has received a lot of attention for its application to molecular evolution and geographic migration of species. More recent work has included infectious diseases especially zoonotic RNA viruses like influenza and rabies. Phylogeography of viruses has the potential to advance surveillance at agencies such as public health departments, agriculture departments, and wildlife agencies. However, little is known about how these agencies could use phylogeography for applied surveillance and the integration of animal and human sequence data. Here, we highlight its potential to support 'translational public health' that could bring sequence data to the forefront of surveillance. We focus on swine influenza H3N2 because of the recent link to a variant form that has also infected humans. We discuss the implications to applied surveillance and the need for an integrated biomedical informatics approach for adoption at agencies of animal and public health.

Title: Live attenuated influenza viruses produced in a suspension process with avian AGE1.CR.pIX cells.
Abstract: Current influenza vaccines are trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated split or subunit vaccines administered intramuscularly, or live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) adapted to replicate at temperatures below body temperature and administered intranasally. Both vaccines are considered safe and efficient, but due to differences in specific properties may complement each other to ensure reliable vaccine coverage. By now, licensed LAIV are produced in embryonated chicken eggs. In the near future influenza vaccines for human use will also be available from adherent MDCK or Vero cell cultures, but a scalable suspension process may facilitate production and supply with vaccines. We evaluated the production of cold-adapted human influenza virus strains in the duck suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX using a chemically-defined medium. One cold-adapted A (H1N1) and one cold-adapted B virus strain was tested, as well as the reference strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). It is shown that a medium exchange is not required for infection and that maximum virus titers are obtained for 1 × 10⁻⁶ trypsin units per cell. 1 L bioreactor cultivations showed that 4 × 10⁶ cells/mL can be infected without a cell density effect achieving titers of 1 × 10⁸ virions/mL after 24 h. Overall, this study demonstrates that AGE1.CR.pIX cells support replication of LAIV strains in a chemically-defined medium using a simple process without medium exchanges. Moreover, the process is fast with peak titers obtained 24 h post infection and easily scalable to industrial volumes as neither microcarriers nor medium replacements are required.

Title: Fluorescence molecular painting of enveloped viruses.
Abstract: In this study, we describe a versatile, flexible, and quick method to label different families of enveloped viruses with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified green fluorescent protein, termed fluorescence molecular painting (FMP). As an example for a potential application, we investigated virus attachment by means of flow cytometry to determine if viral binding behavior may be analyzed after FMP of enveloped viruses. Virus attachment was inhibited by using either dextran sulfate or by blocking attachment sites with virus pre-treatment. Results from the FMP-flow cytometry approach were verified by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Since the modification strategy is applicable to a broad range of proteins and viruses, variations of this method may be useful in a range of research and applied applications from bio-distribution studies to vaccine development and targeted infection for gene delivery.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes a method for labeling enveloped viruses for various applications, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Humans with chronic granulomatous disease maintain humoral immunologic memory despite low frequencies of circulating memory B cells.
Abstract: CD27(+) memory B cells are reduced in the blood of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) for reasons and consequences that remain unclear. Here we confirm not only decreased CD27(+) but also IgG(+) B cells in the blood of CGD patients compared with healthy donors (HDs). However, among IgG(+) B cells, the ratio of CD27(-) to CD27(+) was significantly higher in CGD patients compared with HDs. Similar to conventional memory B cells, CD27(-)IgG(+) B cells of CGD patients expressed activation markers and had undergone somatic hypermutation, albeit at levels lower than their CD27(+) counterparts. Functional analyses revealed slight reductions in frequencies of total IgG but not influenza-specific memory B-cell responses, as measured by Elispot in CGD patients compared with HDs. Serum IgG levels and influenza-specific antibodies were also normal in these CGD patients. Finally, we provide evidence that influenza-specific memory B cells can be present within the CD27(-)IgG(+) B-cell compartment. Together, these findings show that, despite reduced circulating CD27(+) memory B cells, CGD patients maintain an intact humoral immunologic memory, with potential contribution from CD27(-) B cells.

Title: Structural insights into key sites of vulnerability on HIV-1 Env and influenza HA.
Abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are the surface glycoproteins responsible for viral entry into host cells, the first step in the virus life cycle necessary to initiate infection. These glycoproteins exhibit a high degree of sequence variability and glycosylation, which are used as strategies to escape host immune responses. Nonetheless, antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity against these viruses have been isolated that have managed to overcome these barriers. Here, we review recent advances in the structural characterization of these antibodies with their viral antigens that defines a few sites of vulnerability on these viral spikes. These broadly neutralizing antibodies tend to focus their recognition on the sites of similar function between the two viruses: the receptor-binding site and membrane fusion machinery. However, some sites of recognition are unique to the virus neutralized, such as the dense shield of oligomannose carbohydrates on HIV-1 Env. These observations are discussed in the context of structure-based design strategies to aid in vaccine design or development of antivirals.

Title: Genomic reassortment of influenza A virus in North American swine, 1998-2011.
Abstract: Revealing the frequency and determinants of reassortment among RNA genome segments is fundamental to understanding basic aspects of the biology and evolution of the influenza virus. To estimate the extent of genomic reassortment in influenza viruses circulating in North American swine, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 139 whole-genome viral sequences sampled during 1998-2011 and representing seven antigenically distinct viral lineages. The highest amounts of reassortment were detected between the H3 and the internal gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS), while the lowest reassortment frequencies were observed among the H1γ, H1pdm and neuraminidase segments, particularly N1. Less reassortment was observed among specific haemagglutinin-neuraminidase combinations that were more prevalent in swine, suggesting that some genome constellations may be evolutionarily more stable.

Title: Estimating reassortment rates in co-circulating Eurasian swine influenza viruses.
Abstract: Swine have often been considered as a mixing vessel for different influenza strains. In order to assess their role in more detail, we undertook a retrospective sequencing study to detect and characterize the reassortants present in European swine and to estimate the rate of reassortment between H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes with Eurasian (avian-like) internal protein-coding segments. We analysed 69 newly obtained whole genome sequences of subtypes H1N1-H3N2 from swine influenza viruses sampled between 1982 and 2008, using Illumina and 454 platforms. Analyses of these genomes, together with previously published genomes, revealed a large monophyletic clade of Eurasian swine-lineage polymerase segments containing H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes. We subsequently examined reassortments between the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase segments and estimated the reassortment rates between lineages using a recently developed evolutionary analysis method. High rates of reassortment between H1N2 and H1N1 Eurasian swine lineages were detected in European strains, with an average of one reassortment every 2-3 years. This rapid reassortment results from co-circulating lineages in swine, and in consequence we should expect further reassortments between currently circulating swine strains and the recent swine-origin H1N1v pandemic strain.

Title: High influenza a virus infection rates in Mallards bred for hunting in the Camargue, South of France.
Abstract: During the last decade, the role of wildlife in emerging pathogen transmission to domestic animals has often been pointed out. Conversely, far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of game restocking, which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the 2008/2009 nor the 2009/2010 hunting seasons. In 2010 infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions. Measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on infection rates and viral strain sequencing but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir: effects on resistance, immunization and stockpiling.
Abstract: In 2007 New Zealand (NZ) became the first country to make oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) available off-prescription. This study investigated the extent of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir over 5 years, including during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, and the impact of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir on influenza virus oseltamivir susceptibility, personal stockpiling and influenza vaccine uptake. Randomly selected community pharmacies in NZ reported oseltamivir provision by prescription and through pharmacist supply from 1 January 2007 to 15 September 2011. Oseltamivir resistance data on influenza viruses isolated during influenza surveillance from 2008 to 2011 were obtained, along with influenza vaccine uptake data from 2005 to 2011 and influenza detection data. Seventy of 85 eligible pharmacies completed the study (82% response rate). Most supplies of oseltamivir throughout the 5 years were dispensed against a prescription rather than pharmacist supplied, with pharmacist supply responsible for 11% of supplies during the pandemic years (2009-10) versus 27% and 31% during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Pharmacist-supplied oseltamivir did not appear to be associated with the development of resistance, with identified likely stockpiling or with a decline in influenza immunization. Pharmacist supplies largely matched the timing of influenza in the community and peaked in June 2009, as did prescription supplies. Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir in NZ has resulted in no significant change in the development of resistance or rates of influenza immunization. Supplies remained modest and significant consumer stockpiling through pharmacist supply has not occurred, even during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009 and 2010. Pharmacists could be better utilized in ensuring fast distribution of antivirals to influenza sufferers during a pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates oseltamivir use and resistance development at a population level without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Epidemiological dynamics and phylogeography of influenza virus in southern China.
Abstract: Understanding the epidemiological dynamics of influenza virus is central to surveillance and vaccine strain selection. It has been suggested that tropical and subtropical regions represent the global source of influenza epidemics. However, our understanding of the epidemiological dynamics of influenza virus in these regions is limited by a relative lack of long-term data. We analyzed epidemiological and virological data on influenza recorded over a period of 15 years from the metropolitan city of Shenzhen in subtropical southern China. We used wavelet analysis to determine the periodicity of influenza epidemics and molecular phylogeographic analysis to investigate the role of Shenzhen and southern China in the global evolution of influenza virus. We show that southern China is unlikely to represent an epicenter of global influenza activity, because activity in Shenzhen is characterized by significant annual cycles, multiple viral introductions every year, limited persistence across epidemic seasons, and viruses that generally are not positioned on the trunk of the global influenza virus phylogeny. We propose that novel influenza viruses emerge and evolve in multiple geographic localities and that the global evolution of influenza virus is complex and does not simply originate from a southern Chinese epicenter.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes epidemiological and phylogeographic data without explicit genotype-phenotype associations.

Title: WHO recommendations for the viruses to be used in the 2012 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine: epidemiology, antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B influenza viruses collected from February to September 2011.
Abstract: In February and September each year the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends influenza viruses to be included in influenza vaccines for the forthcoming winters in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres respectively. These recommendations are based on data collected by National Influenza Centres (NIC) through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and a more detailed analysis of representative and potential antigenically variant influenza viruses from the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza (WHO CCs) and Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs). This article provides a detailed summary of the antigenic and genetic properties of viruses and additional background data used by WHO experts during development of the recommendations for the 2012 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine composition.

Title: Design and synthesis of a novel ganglioside ligand for influenza A viruses.
Abstract: A novel ganglioside bearing Neua2-3Gal and Neua2-6Gal structures as distal sequences was designed as a ligand for influenza A viruses. The efficient synthesis of the designed ganglioside was accomplished by employing the cassette coupling approach as a key reaction, which was executed between the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide and the cyclic glucosylceramide moiety. Examination of its binding activity to influenza A viruses revealed that the new ligand is recognized by Neua2-3 and 2-6 type viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the design and synthesis of a ganglioside ligand and its binding activity to influenza viruses, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Cross-reactive responses to modified M1₅₈-₆₆ peptides by CD8⁺ T cells that use noncanonical BV genes can describe unknown repertoires.
Abstract: Memory T-cell repertoires are populated by clonotypes selected by an individual's history of antigen exposures. Our previous analysis of middle-age CD8(+) T-cell memory repertoires to the influenza-derived epitope M1(58-66) , described a network of highly cross-reactive BV19 clonotypes responding to M1(58-66) and at least one peptide with a conservative amino acid substitution at either of two TCR contact positions. Here, we report that some substitutions abrogate BV19 responses and favor responses with different BV. Cross-reactive T cells using seven other BV families responded to 12 of 13 peptides tested. BV12 clonotypes define the most extensive cross-reactive network that encompasses seven peptides. We generated 3D networks based on the peptides recognized and BV family used and observed a cluster of five peptides that includes M1(58-66) and another cluster of five peptides that does not include M1(58-66) . The first cluster represents peptides structurally similar to M1(58-66) , and the second represents peptides with more considerable changes in epitope recognition surface. We hypothesize that the second cluster represents the cross-reactive network around another unknown epitope or epitopes. This data supports a model of stable CD8(+) T-cell memory networks that include a substantial contribution from cross-reactive T cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on T-cell receptor cross-reactivity and immune repertoire, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Isolation of a reassortant H13N2 virus from a mallard fecal sample in South Korea.
Abstract: Virus subtype H13N2, A/mallard/Kr/SH38-45/2010 (H13N2), was first isolated from a mallard fecal sample in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes revealed that this virus emerged by genetic mixing between Eurasian and North American gene pools, and possibly between wild ducks and gulls. The H13 and N2 surface genes clustered together in a group with Eurasian isolates from gulls and wild birds, respectively. The PB2, PA, NP, M and NS segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage, whereas the PB1 gene clustered in the North American lineage. Furthermore, they showed a bird-dependent pattern in phylogenetic analysis: the M gene was similar to subtype H13 viruses within gulls, whereas other segments were similar to avian influenza viruses of other subtypes from wild ducks. The data suggests that the novel reassortant H13N2 virus isolated in South Korea might have emerged by genetic reassortment between intercontinental and interspecies transmission in wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and genetic reassortment of viral genes but does not explicitly link these genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Evolutionary history and phylodynamics of influenza A and B neuraminidase (NA) genes inferred from large-scale sequence analyses.
Abstract: Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important surface glycoprotein and plays a vital role in viral replication and drug development. The NA is found in influenza A and B viruses, with nine subtypes classified in influenza A. The complete knowledge of influenza NA evolutionary history and phylodynamics, although critical for the prevention and control of influenza epidemics and pandemics, remains lacking. Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of influenza NA sequences using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods demonstrated that the divergence of influenza viruses into types A and B occurred earlier than the divergence of influenza A NA subtypes. Twenty-three lineages were identified within influenza A, two lineages were classified within influenza B, and most lineages were specific to host, subtype or geographical location. Interestingly, evolutionary rates vary not only among lineages but also among branches within lineages. The estimated tMRCAs of influenza lineages suggest that the viruses of different lineages emerge several months or even years before their initial detection. The d(N)/d(S) ratios ranged from 0.062 to 0.313 for influenza A lineages, and 0.257 to 0.259 for influenza B lineages. Structural analyses revealed that all positively selected sites are at the surface of the NA protein, with a number of sites found to be important for host antibody and drug binding. The divergence into influenza type A and B from a putative ancestral NA was followed by the divergence of type A into nine NA subtypes, of which 23 lineages subsequently diverged. This study provides a better understanding of influenza NA lineages and their evolutionary dynamics, which may facilitate early detection of newly emerging influenza viruses and thus improve influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on evolutionary history and phylogenetics of neuraminidase genes without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: Global transmission of influenza viruses from humans to swine.
Abstract: To determine the extent to which influenza viruses jump between human and swine hosts, we undertook a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of pandemic A/H1N1/09 (H1N1pdm09) influenza virus genome sequence data. From this, we identified at least 49 human-to-swine transmission events that occurred globally during 2009-2011, thereby highlighting the ability of the H1N1pdm09 virus to transmit repeatedly from humans to swine, even following adaptive evolution in humans. Similarly, we identified at least 23 separate introductions of human seasonal (non-pandemic) H1 and H3 influenza viruses into swine globally since 1990. Overall, these results reveal the frequency with which swine are exposed to human influenza viruses, indicate that humans make a substantial contribution to the genetic diversity of influenza viruses in swine, and emphasize the need to improve biosecurity measures at the human-swine interface, including influenza vaccination of swine workers.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports on human-to-swine transmission events and phylogenetics but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Contribution of the Portuguese Laboratory Network for the Diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2009/10 and 2010/11 influenza seasons.
Abstract: This article describes the data obtained by the Portuguese Laboratory Network, reactivated following the World Health Organization declaration of the 2009 influenza pandemic, on the diagnoses of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the pandemic (2009/10) and post-pandemic (2010/11) influenza seasons. The laboratories analysed and reported cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory, which performed more detailed antigenic and genetic characterisation of the virus isolates. In 2009/10, a total of 62,089 ILI cases, distributed in two peaks, were analysed, 25,985 of which were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Children aged 5–14 years were the most affected. Viruses were both antigenically and genetically similar to the pandemic strain A/California/7/2009, included in the 2009/10 pandemic vaccine. During the post-pandemic season, 1,496 ILI cases were tested for influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 572 of which were positive. Infection was mainly diagnosed in adolescent and adults. Although the 2010/11 viruses remained antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009, increased genetic variation was observed. During the two seasons, two viruses with the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, associated with oseltamivir resistance, were detected. The Laboratory Network made an important contribution to the description of the influenza activity in the two seasons.

Title: Frequency of oseltamivir resistance in Sydney, during the Newcastle outbreak of community transmitted oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, Australia, June to August 2011.
Abstract: Although oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals, a recent report from Newcastle, Australia, showed the first sustained community spread, from June to August 2011, of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus carrying the H275Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation. To determine the frequency and the extent of this viral variant spread in the nearest major city to Newcastle, we performed a sequencebased genotypic assessment on samples from 143 oseltamivir untreated and 23 oseltamivir post-treatment individuals with influenza collected contemporaneously in Sydney, 120 km southwest of Newcastle. The detection of two of 143 (1.4%) community-derived samples containing H275Y suggests a low prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the general community and no convincing evidence of spread of the NA H275Y-bearing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. In oseltamivir treated patients, oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus continue to emerge with three of 23 (13%) post-treatment samples containing the H275Y mutation. The observation of signature mutations and distinct phylogenetic relationship in full-length sequences of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes derived from 2011 strains against 2009 strains indicates continued genetic evolution and antigenic drift of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in Australia.

Title: Comprehensive global amino acid sequence analysis of PB1F2 protein of influenza A H5N1 viruses and the influenza A virus subtypes responsible for the 20th-century pandemics.
Abstract: PB1F2 is the 11th protein of influenza A virus translated from +1 alternate reading frame of PB1 gene. Since the discovery, varying sizes and functions of the PB1F2 protein of influenza A viruses have been reported. Selection of PB1 gene segment in the pandemics, variable size and pleiotropic effect of PB1F2 intrigued us to analyze amino acid sequences of this protein in various influenza A viruses. Amino acid sequences for PB1F2 protein of influenza A H5N1, H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes were obtained from Influenza Research Database. Multiple sequence alignments of the PB1F2 protein sequences of the aforementioned subtypes were used to determine the size, variable and conserved domains and to perform mutational analysis. Analysis showed that 96·4% of the H5N1 influenza viruses harbored full-length PB1F2 protein. Except for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, all the subtypes of the 20th-century pandemic influenza viruses contained full-length PB1F2 protein. Through the years, PB1F2 protein of the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses has undergone much variation. PB1F2 protein sequences of H5N1 viruses showed both human- and avian host-specific conserved domains. Global database of PB1F2 protein revealed that N66S mutation was present only in 3·8% of the H5N1 strains. We found a novel mutation, N84S in the PB1F2 protein of 9·35% of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 influenza viruses. Varying sizes and mutations of the PB1F2 protein in different influenza A virus subtypes with pandemic potential were obtained. There was genetic divergence of the protein in various hosts which highlighted the host-specific evolution of the virus. However, studies are required to correlate this sequence variability with the virulence and pathogenicity.

Reason: The paper performs sequence analysis of PB1F2 protein and notes mutations but does not explicitly link these to phenotypic traits.

Abstract: We report here the complete genomic sequence of an H7N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolate, which was obtained from duck in 1996. This is the first report of this subtype of AIV being isolated from duck in Guangdong of Southern China. Genomic sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that it was highly homologous with the wild bird virus A/ruddy turnstone/Delaware Bay/135/1996 (H7N3) and that all eight genes of this virus belonged to the North America gene pool. The availability of genome sequences is helpful to further investigations of epidemiology and evolution of AIV between waterfowl and wild birds.

Title: Evolution, safety, and highly pathogenic influenza viruses.
Abstract: Experience with influenza has shown that predictions of virus phenotype or fitness from nucleotide sequence are imperfect and that predicting the timing and course of evolution is extremely difficult. Such uncertainty means that the risk of experiments with mammalian-transmissible, possibly highly virulent influenza viruses remains high even if some aspects of their laboratory biology are reassuring; it also implies limitations on the ability of laboratory observations to guide interpretation of surveillance of strains in the field. Thus, we propose that future experiments with virulent pathogens whose accidental or deliberate release could lead to extensive spread in human populations should be limited by explicit risk-benefit considerations.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing the challenges in predicting phenotype from genotype and the risks of research, without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Benefits and risks of influenza research: lessons learned.
Abstract: Given the yearly challenge of seasonal influenza and the potential catastrophic consequences of future pandemics, the need for intensive basic and clinical influenza research is unquestionable. Although the fruits of decades of research have enabled dramatic improvements in our ability to prevent and treat influenza, many fundamental questions remain, including those related to the complex factors associated with host switching and transmission of influenza viruses. Recent public concern over two H5N1 influenza manuscripts that studied the transmissibility of influenza viruses has triggered intense discussion on dual-use research and the way forward.

Title: Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation.
Abstract: Two studies of H5N1 avian influenza viruses that had been genetically engineered to render them transmissible between ferrets have proved highly controversial. Divergent opinions exist about the importance of these studies of influenza transmission and about potential 'dual use' research implications. No consensus has developed yet about how to balance these concerns. After not recommending immediate full publication of earlier, less complete versions of the studies, the United States National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity subsequently recommended full publication of more complete manuscripts; however, controversy about this and similar research remains.

Title: Genetic evolution of the neuraminidase of influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2009 and its correspondence to haemagglutinin evolution.
Abstract: Each year, influenza viruses cause epidemics by evading pre-existing humoral immunity through mutations in the major glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). In 2004, the antigenic evolution of HA of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses was mapped (Smith et al., Science 305, 371-376, 2004) from its introduction in humans in 1968 until 2003. The current study focused on the genetic evolution of NA and compared it with HA using the dataset of Smith and colleagues, updated to the epidemic of the 2009/2010 season. Phylogenetic trees and genetic maps were constructed to visualize the genetic evolution of NA and HA. The results revealed multiple reassortment events over the years. Overall rates of evolutionary change were lower for NA than for HA1 at the nucleotide level. Selection pressures were estimated, revealing an abundance of negatively selected sites and sparse positively selected sites. The differences found between the evolution of NA and HA1 warrant further analysis of the evolution of NA at the phenotypic level, as has been done previously for HA.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on genetic evolution and phylogenetics of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Abstract: In an observational cohort study, we found that adults hospitalized for oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) seasonal H1N1 influenza (n = 46) were older than those infected with oseltamivir-susceptible strains (n = 31) [74(IQR 59-83) versus 64(IQR 48-76) years; P = 0·045], and most had major comorbidities (78% versus 65%). Disease severity and clinical outcomes were comparable between the two groups: radiographic pneumonia 40-42%, supplemental oxygen use 47-48%, critical illness 11-13%, median duration of hospitalization 5-6 days, death rate 6-9%. Failure to receive effective antiviral therapy was associated with progression to critical illness (23% versus 0%, P = 0·016) and death (20% versus 0%, P = 0·033) in hospitalized patients with seasonal H1N1 influenza.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, 2011-12 season and composition of the 2012-13 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: During the 2011-12 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity* occurred at low levels during October through December and increased in January and February before peaking in mid-March. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated overall, but influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) and influenza B viruses also circulated widely. This influenza season was mild compared with recent years, with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI),† lower rates of hospitalizations, and fewer deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2011-12 influenza season (October 2, 2011-May 19, 2012) and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2012-13 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Title: Pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection among 2009 Hajj Pilgrims from Southern Iran: a real-time RT-PCR-based study.
Abstract: Hajj is a mass gathering undertaken annually in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The 2009 Hajj coincided with both the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) and seasonal types of influenza A viruses. The interaction between pandemic influenza and Hajj could cause both a high level of mortality among the pilgrims and the spread of infection in their respective countries upon their return home. The present study attempted to determine the point prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 among returning Iranian pilgrims, most of whom had been vaccinated for seasonal influenza but not A(H1N1)pdm09. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 305 pilgrims arriving at the airport in Shiraz, Iran. RNA was extracted from the samples and A(H1N1)pdm09 and other seasonal influenza A viruses were detected using TaqMan real-time PCR. For A(H1N1)pdm09-positive samples, the sensitivity to oseltamivir was also evaluated. Subjects included 132 (43.3%) men and 173 (56.7%) women, ranging in age from 24 to 65 years. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in five (1.6%) pilgrims and other influenza A viruses in eight (2.6%). All the A(H1N1)pdm09 were sensitive to oseltamivir. Only five cases were found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09, and it seems unlikely that the arrival of infected pilgrims to their homelands would cause an outbreak of a new wave of infection there. Thus, the low morbidity and mortality rates among the pilgrims could be attributed to the characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09, which causes morbidity and mortality in a way similar to the seasonal influenza infections, absence of high-risk individuals among the Iranian pilgrims, and the instructions given to them about contact and hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette.
Relevant: False

Title: Oncolytic effects of a novel influenza A virus expressing interleukin-15 from the NS reading frame.
Abstract: Oncolytic influenza A viruses with deleted NS1 gene (delNS1) replicate selectively in tumour cells with defective interferon response and/or activated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. To develop a delNS1 virus with specific immunostimulatory properties, we used an optimised technology to insert the interleukin-15 (IL-15) coding sequence into the viral NS gene segment (delNS1-IL-15). DelNS1 and delNS1-IL-15 exerted similar oncolytic effects. Both viruses replicated and caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in interferon-defective melanoma cells. Virus replication was required for their oncolytic activity. Cisplatin enhanced the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses. The cytotoxic drug increased delNS1 replication and delNS1-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Interference with MEK/ERK signalling by RNAi-mediated depletion or the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not affect the oncolytic effects of the delNS1 viruses. In oncolysis sensitive melanoma cells, delNS1-IL-15 (but not delNS1) infection resulted in the production of IL-15 levels ranging from 70 to 1140 pg/mL in the cell culture supernatants. The supernatants of delNS1-IL-15-infected (but not of delNS1-infected) melanoma cells induced primary human natural killer cell-mediated lysis of non-infected tumour cells. In conclusion, we constructed a novel oncolytic influenza virus that combines the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses with immunostimulatory properties through production of functional IL-15. Moreover, we showed that the oncolytic activity of delNS1 viruses can be enhanced in combination with cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: This study focuses on oncolytic effects of engineered influenza viruses in cancer cells, without explicit viral genotype-phenotype linkage related to natural viral variation.

Title: Human infections with novel reassortant influenza A(H3N2)v viruses, United States, 2011.
Abstract: During July-December 2011, a variant virus, influenza A(H3N2)v, caused 12 human cases of influenza. The virus contained genes originating from swine, avian, and human viruses, including the M gene from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Influenza A(H3N2)v viruses were antigenically distinct from seasonal influenza viruses and similar to proposed vaccine virus A/Minnesota/11/2010.

Title: A survey of avian influenza in tree sparrows in China in 2011.
Abstract: Tree sparrows (Passer montanus) are widely distributed in all seasons in many countries. In this study, a survey and relevant experiments on avian influenza (AI) in tree sparrows were conducted. The results suggested that the receptor for avian influenza viruses (AIVs), SAα2,3Gal, is abundant in the respiratory tract of tree sparrows, and most of the tree sparrows infected experimentally with two H5 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses died within five days after inoculation. Furthermore, no AIVs were isolated from the rectum eluate of 1300 tree sparrows, but 94 serological positives of AI were found in 800 tree sparrows. The serological positives were more prevalent for H5 subtype HPAI (94/800) than for H7 subtype AI (0/800), more prevalent for clade 2.3.2.1 H5 subtype HPAI (89/800) than for clade 2.3.4 (1/800) and clade 7.2 (4/800) H5 subtype HPAI, more prevalent for clade 2.3.2.1 H5 subtype HPAI in a city in southern China (82/800) than in a city in northern China (8/800). The serological data are all consistent with the distribution of the subtypes or clades of AI in poultry in China. Previously, sparrows or other passerine birds were often found to be pathogenically negative for AIVs, except when an AIV was circulating in the local poultry, or the tested passerine birds were from a region near waterfowl-rich bodies of water. Taken together, the data suggest that tree sparrows are susceptible to infection of AIVs, and surveys targeting sparrows can provide good serological data about the circulation of AIVs in relevant regions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper surveys avian influenza in tree sparrows and reports serological data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Magic-angle-spinning NMR of the drug resistant S31N M2 proton transporter from influenza A.
Abstract: We report chemical shift assignments of the drug-resistant S31N mutant of M2(18-60) determined using 3D magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR spectra acquired with a (15)N-(13)C ZF-TEDOR transfer followed by (13)C-(13)C mixing by RFDR. The MAS spectra reveal two sets of resonances, indicating that the tetramer assembles as a dimer of dimers, similar to the wild-type channel. Helicies from the two sets of chemical shifts are shown to be in close proximity at residue H37, and the assignments reveal a difference in the helix torsion angles, as predicted by TALOS+, for the key resistance residue N31. In contrast to wild-type M2(18-60), chemical shift changes are minimal upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, suggesting that the drug does not bind to S31N M2.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports NMR chemical shift assignments of a drug-resistant M2 proton transporter mutant but does not explicitly link genotype to viral phenotype.

Title: Analysis of high-depth sequence data for studying viral diversity: a comparison of next generation sequencing platforms using Segminator II.
Abstract: Next generation sequencing provides detailed insight into the variation present within viral populations, introducing the possibility of treatment strategies that are both reactive and predictive. Current software tools, however, need to be scaled up to accommodate for high-depth viral data sets, which are often temporally or spatially linked. In addition, due to the development of novel sequencing platforms and chemistries, each with implicit strengths and weaknesses, it will be helpful for researchers to be able to routinely compare and combine data sets from different platforms/chemistries. In particular, error associated with a specific sequencing process must be quantified so that true biological variation may be identified. Segminator II was developed to allow for the efficient comparison of data sets derived from different sources. We demonstrate its usage by comparing large data sets from 12 influenza H1N1 samples sequenced on both the 454 Life Sciences and Illumina platforms, permitting quantification of platform error. For mismatches median error rates at 0.10 and 0.12%, respectively, suggested that both platforms performed similarly. For insertions and deletions median error rates within the 454 data (at 0.3 and 0.2%, respectively) were significantly higher than those within the Illumina data (0.004 and 0.006%, respectively). In agreement with previous observations these higher rates were strongly associated with homopolymeric stretches on the 454 platform. Outside of such regions both platforms had similar indel error profiles. Additionally, we apply our software to the identification of low frequency variants. We have demonstrated, using Segminator II, that it is possible to distinguish platform specific error from biological variation using data derived from two different platforms. We have used this approach to quantify the amount of error present within the 454 and Illumina platforms in relation to genomic location as well as location on the read. Given that next generation data is increasingly important in the analysis of drug-resistance and vaccine trials, this software will be useful to the pathogen research community.

Title: Inhibition of influenza A virus replication by antagonism of a PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway member identified by gene-trap insertional mutagenesis.
Abstract: Host genes serving potential roles in virus replication may be exploited as novel antiviral targets. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of host gene expression was used to validate candidate genes in screens against six unrelated viruses, most importantly influenza. A mouse model of influenza A virus infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of a candidate FDA-approved drug identified in the screening effort. Several genes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were found to support broad-spectrum viral replication in vitro by RNA interference. This led to the discovery that everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, showed in vitro antiviral activity against cowpox, dengue type 2, influenza A, rhino- and respiratory syncytial viruses. In a lethal mouse infection model of influenza A (H1N1 and H5N1) virus infection, everolimus treatment (1 mg/kg/day) significantly delayed death but could not prevent mortality. Fourteen days of treatment was more beneficial in delaying the time to death than treatment for seven days. Pathological findings in everolimus-treated mice showed reduced lung haemorrhage and lung weights in response to infection. These results provide proof of concept that cellular targets can be identified by gene knockout methods, and highlight the importance of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in supporting viral infections.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on host gene targets and antiviral drug effects on influenza replication, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Abstract: This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* since the beginning of the 2011-12 influenza season (October 2, 2011) and updates the previous report. From October through early January, influenza activity remained low throughout the United States. Activity increased slightly in early February 2012, but remains low. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses all have been identified thus far this influenza season, and the majority of viruses in circulation are antigenically similar to strains included in the 2011-12 vaccine.

Title: Characterization of the viral microbiome in patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections, using metagenomic sequencing.
Abstract: The human respiratory tract is heavily exposed to microorganisms. Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease. Furthermore, as viruses have limited means of transmission, viruses that cause pathogenicity in other tissues may be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is therefore important to chart the human virome in this compartment. We have studied nasopharyngeal aspirate samples submitted to the Karolinska University Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden from March 2004 to May 2005 for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses. Most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families; Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae or Orthomyxoviridae. The study also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C, and identified a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin.
Relevant: False
Reason: This metagenomic sequencing study characterizes viral diversity but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Inferring pandemic growth rates from sequence data.
Abstract: Using sequence data to infer population dynamics is playing an increasing role in the analysis of outbreaks. The most common methods in use, based on coalescent inference, have been widely used but not extensively tested against simulated epidemics. Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased. We illustrate this with an application to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Title: One-step detection of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus by the RT-SmartAmp assay and its clinical validation.
Abstract: In 2009, a pandemic (pdm) influenza A(H1N1) virus infection quickly circulated globally resulting in about 18,000 deaths around the world. In Japan, infected patients accounted for 16% of the total population. The possibility of human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic novel influenza viruses is becoming a fear for human health and society. To address the clinical need for rapid diagnosis, we have developed a new method, the "RT-SmartAmp assay", to rapidly detect the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus from patient swab samples. The RT-SmartAmp assay comprises both reverse transcriptase (RT) and isothermal DNA amplification reactions in one step, where RNA extraction and PCR reaction are not required. We used an exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent primer to specifically detect the HA segment of the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus within 40 minutes without cross-reacting with the seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), or B-type (Victoria) viruses. We evaluated the RT-SmartAmp method in clinical research carried out in Japan during a pandemic period of October 2009 to January 2010. A total of 255 swab samples were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness at three hospitals and eleven clinics located in the Tokyo and Chiba areas in Japan. The 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus was detected by the RT-SmartAmp assay, and the detection results were subsequently compared with data of current influenza diagnostic tests (lateral flow immuno-chromatographic tests) and viral genome sequence analysis. In conclusion, by the RT-SmartAmp assay we could detect the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus in patients' swab samples even in early stages after the initial onset of influenza symptoms. Thus, the RT-SmartAmp assay is considered to provide a simple and practical tool to rapidly detect the 2009 pdm influenza A(H1N1) virus.

Title: Dynamic patterns of circulating seasonal and pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses from 2007-2010 in and around Delhi, India.
Abstract: Influenza surveillance was carried out in a subset of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting at an Employee Health Clinic (EHS) at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi (urban) and pediatric out patients department of civil hospital at Ballabhgarh (peri-urban), under the Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project (CRHSP) of AIIMS, in Delhi region from January 2007 to December 2010. Of the 3264 samples tested, 541 (17%) were positive for influenza viruses, of which 221 (41%) were pandemic Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 168 (31%) were seasonal influenza A, and 152 (28%) were influenza B. While the Influenza viruses were detected year-round, their types/subtypes varied remarkably. While there was an equal distribution of seasonal A(H1N1) and influenza B in 2007, predominance of influenza B was observed in 2008. At the beginning of 2009, circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses was observed, followed later by emergence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with co-circulation of influenza B viruses. Influenza B was dominant subtype in early 2010, with second wave of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in August-September, 2010. With the exception of pandemic H1N1 emergence in 2009, the peaks of influenza activity coincided primarily with monsoon season, followed by minor peak in winter at both urban and rural sites. Age group analysis of influenza positivity revealed that the percent positivity of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was highest in >5-18 years age groups (OR 2.5; CI = 1.2-5.0; p = 0.009) when compared to seasonal influenza. Phylogenetic analysis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from urban and rural sites did not reveal any major divergence from other Indian strains or viruses circulating worldwide. Continued surveillance globally will help define regional differences in influenza seasonality, as well as, to determine optimal periods to implement influenza vaccination programs among priority populations.

Title: No evidence for intra-segment recombination of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in swine.
Abstract: Hao (2011) reported that the PB2 genes of three swine influenza A viruses were likely generated through homologous recombination between two closely related parental strains. However, we show that Hao's observation is an artifact of incorrect taxon sampling arising through the lack of an appropriate evolutionary context. Through rigorous phylogenetic analyses we explain the evolutionary origins of these stains and confirm the lack of any statistical support for intra-segmental recombination.

Title: Human virus-specific effector-type T cells accumulate in blood but not in lymph nodes.
Abstract: It is believed that the size of the CD8(+) T-cell pool is fixed and that with every new viral challenge, the size of the pre-existing memory-cell population shrinks to make way for the new virus-specific cells. CMV-seropositive individuals have high numbers of CMV-specific resting-effector type CD8(+) T cells in their peripheral blood (PB). This prompted us to investigate whether CMV infection limits immunologic space at sites where immune reactions are initiated, such as in the lymph nodes (LNs). LN and paired PB samples were analyzed for CMV-, EBV-, and influenza-specific CD8(+) T cells. In marked contrast to blood, LNs contained significantly lower numbers of CX3CR1-expressing effector-type CD8(+) T cells, whereas the CMV-specific cells that were found in the LNs resembled polyfunctional memory-type cells. In contrast, EBV- and influenza-specific CD8(+) T cells were highly similar between PB and LNs both in number and function. Therefore, it is unlikely that CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the LNs restrain the immunologic space of other virus-specific cells.
Relevant: False

Title: DRB1*12:01 presents a unique subset of epitopes by preferring aromatics in pocket 9.
Abstract: This study characterized the unique peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-DRB1*12:01 (DR1201), an allele studied in the context of various autoimmune diseases, using a peptide competition assay and structural modeling. After defining Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 Matrix Protein M1 (H1MP) 40-54 as a DR1201 restricted epitope, the critical anchor residues within this sequence were confirmed by measuring the relative binding of peptides with non-conservative substitutions in competition with biotin labeled H1MP(40-54) peptide. Based on this information, a set of peptides was designed with single amino acid substitutions at these anchor positions. The overall peptide binding preferences for the DR1201 allele were deduced by incubating these peptides in competition with the reference H1MP(40-54) to determine the relative binding affinities of each to recombinant DR1201 protein. As expected, pocket 1 preferred methionine and aliphatic residues, and tolerated phenylalanine. Pocket 4 was mostly composed of hydrophobic residues, thereby preferentially accommodating aliphatic residues, but could also weakly accommodate lysine due to its slightly acidic environment. Pocket 6 accepted a wide range of amino acids because of the diverse residues that comprise this pocket. Pocket 9 accepted aliphatic and negatively charged amino acids, but showed a remarkable preference for aromatic residues due to the conformation of the pocket, which lacks the typical salt bridge between β57Asp and α76Arg. These binding characteristics contrast with the closely related DR1104 allele, distinguishing DR1201 among the alleles of the HLA-DR5 group. These empirical results were used to develop an algorithm to predict peptide binding to DR1201. This algorithm was used to verify T cell epitopes within novel antigenic peptides identified by tetramer staining and within peptides from published reports that contain putative DR1201 epitopes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes peptide binding preferences of an HLA allele and T cell epitopes without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Is there a twelfth protein-coding gene in the genome of influenza A? A selection-based approach to the detection of overlapping genes in closely related sequences.
Abstract: Protein-coding genes often contain long overlapping open-reading frames (ORFs), which may or may not be functional. Current methods that utilize the signature of purifying selection to detect functional overlapping genes are limited to the analysis of sequences from divergent species, thus rendering them inapplicable to genes found only in closely related sequences. Here, we present a method for the detection of selection signatures on overlapping reading frames by using closely related sequences, and apply the method to several known overlapping genes, and to an overlapping ORF on the negative strand of segment 8 of influenza A virus (NEG8), for which the suggestion has been made that it is functional. We find no evidence that NEG8 is under selection, suggesting that the intact reading frame might be non-functional, although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the method is not sensitive enough to detect the signature of selection acting on this gene. We present the limitations of the method using known overlapping genes and suggest several approaches to improve it in future studies. Finally, we examine alternative explanations for the sequence conservation of NEG8 in the absence of selection. We show that overlap type and genomic context affect the conservation of intact overlapping ORFs and should therefore be considered in any attempt of estimating the signature of selection in overlapping genes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study develops a method to detect overlapping genes using sequence data but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Mimotopes selected with neutralizing antibodies against multiple subtypes of influenza A.
Abstract: The mimotopes of viruses are considered as the good targets for vaccine design. We prepared mimotopes against multiple subtypes of influenza A and evaluate their immune responses in flu virus challenged Balb/c mice. The mimotopes of influenza A including pandemic H1N1, H3N2, H2N2 and H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus were screened by peptide phage display libraries, respectively. These mimotopes were engineered in one protein as multi- epitopes in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified. Balb/c mice were immunized using the multi-mimotopes protein and specific antibody responses were analyzed using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lung inflammation level was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Linear heptopeptide and dodecapeptide mimotopes were obtained for these influenza virus. The recombinant multi-mimotopes protein was a 73 kDa fusion protein. Comparing immunized infected groups with unimmunized infected subsets, significant differences were observed in the body weight loss and survival rate. The antiserum contained higher HI Ab titer against H1N1 virus and the lung inflammation level were significantly decreased in immunized infected groups. Phage-displayed mimotopes against multiple subtypes of influenza A were accessible to the mouse immune system and triggered a humoral response to above virus.
Relevant: False

Title: Swine influenza virus infection in different age groups of pigs in farrow-to-finish farms in Thailand.
Abstract: Understanding swine influenza virus (SIV) ecology has become more and more important from both the pig industry and public health points of views. However, the mechanism whereby SIV occurs in pig farms is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a proper strategy for SIV surveillance. We conducted longitudinal monitoring in 6 farrow-to-finish farms in the central region of Thailand from 2008 to 2009. Nasal swabs and serum samples were collected periodically from clinically healthy pigs consisting of sows, fattening pigs, weaned piglets and pigs transferred from other farms. A total of 731 nasal swabs were subjected to virus isolation and 641 serum samples were subjected to detection of SIV antibodies against H1 and H3 subtypes using the hemagglutination inhibition test and ELISA. Twelve SIVs were isolated in this study and eleven were from piglets aged 4 and 8 weeks. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that SIVs isolated from different farms shared a common ancestor. Antibodies against SIVs were detected in fattening pigs on farms with no SIV isolation in the respective periods studied. These observations suggested that piglets aged 8 weeks or younger could be a main target for SIV isolation. Farm-to-farm transmission was suggested for farms where pigs from other farms are introduced periodically. In addition, antibodies against SIVs detected in fattening pigs could be a marker for SIV infection in a farm. The present study provided important information on SIV surveillance that will enable better understanding of SIV ecology in farrow-to-finish farms.

Reason: The study focuses on surveillance and epidemiology of swine influenza virus infection in different pig age groups, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of the non-structural (NS) gene of influenza A viruses isolated in Kazakhstan in 2002-2009.
Abstract: Although the important role of the non-structural (NS1 and NEP) gene of influenza A in virulence of the virus is well established, our knowledge about the extent of variation in the NS gene pool of influenza A viruses in their natural reservoirs in Kazakhstan is incomplete. 17 influenza A viruses of different subtypes were studied in this paper. Seven types of haemagglutinin and five different neuraminidase subtypes in eight combinations were found among the isolated viruses. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of isolated viruses revealed a substantial number of silent mutations, which results in high degree of homology in amino acid sequences. By phylogenetic analysis it was shown that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A with 5 Clades and B, were present at the same time in Kazakhstan. The degree of variation within the alleles was very low. In our study allele A viruses had a maximum of 5% amino acid divergence in Clade while allele B viruses had only 4% amino acid divergence.

Title: Temporally structured metapopulation dynamics and persistence of influenza A H3N2 virus in humans.
Abstract: Populations of seasonal influenza virus experience strong annual bottlenecks that pose a considerable extinction risk. It has been suggested that an influenza source population located in tropical Southeast or East Asia seeds annual temperate epidemics. Here we investigate the seasonal dynamics and migration patterns of influenza A H3N2 virus by analysis of virus samples obtained from 2003 to 2006 from Australia, Europe, Japan, New York, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and newly sequenced viruses from Hong Kong. In contrast to annual temperate epidemics, relatively low levels of relative genetic diversity and no seasonal fluctuations characterized virus populations in tropical Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis using discrete temporal and spatial characters reveal high rates of viral migration between urban centers tested. Although the virus population that migrated between Southeast Asia and Hong Kong persisted through time, this was dependent on virus input from temperate regions and these tropical regions did not maintain a source for annual H3N2 influenza epidemics. We further show that multiple lineages may seed annual influenza epidemics, and that each region may function as a potential source population. We therefore propose that the global persistence of H3N2 influenza A virus is the result of a migrating metapopulation in which multiple different localities may seed seasonal epidemics in temperate regions in a given year. Such complex global migration dynamics may confound control efforts and contribute to the emergence and spread of antigenic variants and drug-resistant viruses.

More than 83 million patients have been exposed to the product since its introduction. Oseltamivir is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in the clinical management of pandemic and seasonal influenza of varying severity, and as the primary antiviral agent for treatment of avian H5N1 influenza infection in humans. This article is a nonsystematic review of the experience gained from the first 10 years of using oseltamivir for influenza infections since its launch in early 2000, emphasizing recent advances in our understanding of the product and its clinical utility in five main areas. The article reviews the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, including information on special populations such as children and elderly adults, and the co-administration of oseltamivir with other agents. This is followed by a summary of data on the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis in patients with all types of influenza, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza. The implications of changes in susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to oseltamivir and other antiviral agents are also described, as is the emergence of antiviral resistance during and after the 2009 pandemic. The fourth main section deals with the safety profile of oseltamivir in standard and special patient populations, and reviews spontaneously reported adverse event data from the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods and the topical issue of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Finally, the article considers the pharmacoeconomics of oseltamivir in comparison with vaccination and usual care regimens, and as a component of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical review of oseltamivir use and resistance, focusing on pharmacology and clinical experience rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (Tim-3)/Galectin-9 interaction regulates influenza A virus-specific humoral and CD8 T-cell responses.
Abstract: Reactions to pathogens are usually tuned to effect immunity and limit tissue damage. Several host counterinflammatory mechanisms inhibit tissue damage but these may also act to constrain the effectiveness of immunity to acute infections, as we demonstrate in mice acutely infected with influenza A virus (IAV). We show that compared with wild type (WT), galectin-9 knockout (G9KO) mice mounted a more robust acute phase virus-specific CD8 T-cell response as well as higher and more rapid virus-specific serum IgM, IgG, and IgA responses and also cleared virus more rapidly than did WT mice. Blocking galectin-9 signals to Tim-3-expressing cells using a Tim-3 fusion protein resulted in improved immune responses in WT mice. When IAV immune mice were challenged with a heterologous IAV, the secondary IAV-specific CD8 T-cell responses were four- to fivefold higher in G9KO compared with WT mice. Our results indicate that manipulating galectin signals may represent a convenient approach to improve immune responses to some vaccines.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates host immune regulatory mechanisms affecting influenza-specific immune responses, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1): updated nomenclature.
Abstract: Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) throughout many regions of the eastern hemisphere has led to the emergence of new phylogenetic groups. A total of 1637 new H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences have become available since the previous nomenclature recommendations described in 2009 by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group. A comprehensive analysis including all the new data is needed to update HA clade nomenclature. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from data sets of all available H5N1 HA sequences. New clades were designated on the basis of phylogeny and p-distance using the pre-established nomenclature system (Emerg Infec Dis 2008; 14:e1). Each circulating H5N1 clade was subjected to further phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide sequence divergence calculations. All recently circulating clades (clade 1 in the Mekong River Delta, 2.1.3 in Indonesia, 2.2 in India/Bangladesh, 2.2.1 in Egypt, 2.3.2, 2.3.4 and 7 in Asia) required assignment of divergent HA genes to new second-, third-, and/or fourth-order clades. At the same time, clades 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and several second- and third-order groups from clade 2 have not been detected since 2008 or earlier. New designations are recommended for 12 HA clades, named according to previously defined criteria. In addition, viruses from 13 clades have not been detected since 2008 or earlier. The periodic updating of this dynamic classification system allows continued use of a unified nomenclature in all H5N1 studies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic classification and nomenclature of H5N1 clades without linking genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Viva la revolución: rethinking influenza a virus antigenic drift.
Abstract: Rapid antigenic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin has precluded developing vaccines that provide durable protection. The yearly costs of influenza (circa $10(11) in the USA alone) easily justify investments in better understanding the interaction of influenza with antibodies and other inducible elements of the immune system that potentially limit or circumvent antigenic variation. Here, I summarize exciting new findings that offer the possibility of a quantum improvement in vaccine efficacy, focusing on studies clearly documenting robust neutralizing antibody responses to the conserved stem region of the hemagglutinin.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses antigenic drift and immune responses but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionary dynamics of local pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus lineages revealed by whole-genome analysis.
Abstract: Virus gene sequencing and phylogenetics can be used to study the epidemiological dynamics of rapidly evolving viruses. With complete genome data, it becomes possible to identify and trace individual transmission chains of viruses such as influenza virus during the course of an epidemic. Here we sequenced 153 pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus genomes from United Kingdom isolates from the first (127 isolates) and second (26 isolates) waves of the 2009 pandemic and used their sequences, dates of isolation, and geographical locations to infer the genetic epidemiology of the epidemic in the United Kingdom. We demonstrate that the epidemic in the United Kingdom was composed of many cocirculating lineages, among which at least 13 were exclusively or predominantly United Kingdom clusters. The estimated divergence times of two of the clusters predate the detection of pandemic H1N1/09 virus in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the pandemic H1N1/09 virus was already circulating in the United Kingdom before the first clinical case. Crucially, three clusters contain isolates from the second wave of infections in the United Kingdom, two of which represent chains of transmission that appear to have persisted within the United Kingdom between the first and second waves. This demonstrates that whole-genome analysis can track in fine detail the behavior of individual influenza virus lineages during the course of a single epidemic or pandemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological dynamics without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Migratory flyway and geographical distance are barriers to the gene flow of influenza virus among North American birds.
Abstract: Despite the importance of migratory birds in the ecology and evolution of avian influenza virus (AIV), there is a lack of information on the patterns of AIV spread at the intra-continental scale. We applied a variety of statistical phylogeographic techniques to a plethora of viral genome sequence data to determine the strength, pattern and determinants of gene flow in AIV sampled from wild birds in North America. These analyses revealed a clear isolation-by-distance of AIV among sampling localities. In addition, we show that phylogeographic models incorporating information on the avian flyway of sampling proved a better fit to the observed sequence data than those specifying homogeneous or random rates of gene flow among localities. In sum, these data strongly suggest that the intra-continental spread of AIV by migratory birds is subject to major ecological barriers, including spatial distance and avian flyway.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies gene flow and phylogeography of avian influenza viruses without explicit links between genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in England and Scotland, 2009-2010.
Abstract: Oseltamivir has been widely used for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, and by April 30, 2010, a total of 285 resistant cases were reported worldwide, including 45 in the United Kingdom. To determine risk factors for emergence of oseltamivir resistance and severe infection, a case-control study was conducted in the United Kingdom. Study participants were hospitalized in England or Scotland during January 4, 2009-April 30, 2010. Controls had confirmed oseltamivir-sensitive pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infections, and case-patients had confirmed oseltamivir-resistant infections. Of 28 case-patients with available information, 21 (75%) were immunocompromised; 31 of 33 case-patients (94%) received antiviral drugs before a sample was obtained. After adjusting for confounders, case-patients remained significantly more likely than controls to be immunocompromised and at higher risk for showing development of respiratory complications. Selective drug pressure likely explains the development of oseltamivir resistance, especially among immunocompromised patients. Monitoring of antiviral resistance is strongly recommended in this group.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is a case-control study on oseltamivir resistance emergence and risk factors, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage analysis.

Title: [Bioinformatics technologies for the analysis of antigenic evolution of influenza viruses].
Abstract: Human influenza viruses mutate from time to time, causing annual epidemics worldwide. The strong immune pressure in the human population selects a new variant every year, and the antigenic change is one of the primary reasons why vaccination is not a perfect measure to control seasonal influenza. Thus prediction of antigenic change of influenza A virus has been one of the major public health goals. In this review bioinformatics technologies that have been developed to achieve this goal were summarized.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review of bioinformatics technologies for antigenic evolution analysis, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: No association between mannose-binding lectin deficiency and H1N1 2009 infection observed during the first season of this novel pandemic influenza virus.
Abstract: Genetic variations in host immunity may influence susceptibility to novel infections like the recently emergent pandemic influenza virus. Prior studies demonstrated that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) inactivates influenza. Furthermore, MBL deficiency is common and appears to predispose to respiratory virus infections. Therefore, we studied whether MBL deficiency played a role in infection with the novel H1N1 2009 influenza strain in exposed health care workers. In a nested case-control study, we observed no association between phenotypic MBL deficiency, variously defined, and predisposition to H1N1 2009 influenza in 63 pairs of seropositive and seronegative participants. MBL appears to currently have little impact on innate immune responses to H1N1 2009 influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates host genetic variation (MBL deficiency) and susceptibility to H1N1 infection, focusing on host factors rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States and worldwide, May 22-September 3, 2011.
Abstract: During May 22-September 3, 2011, the United States experienced low levels of influenza activity; 2009 influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were detected worldwide and identified sporadically in the United States. Typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide since the last update.

Title: Viral genetic sequence variations in pandemic H1N1/2009 and seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses within an individual, a household and a community.
Abstract: There are few data in the literature on viral sequence variation between host generations/successive transmission events. Relatively little is known about the sequence heterogeneity of the influenza viruses transmitted within families. To study the molecular epidemiology of influenza virus and to determine the sequence variation within an individual, a household and a community during the first wave of influenza pandemic in 2009. A prospective study of household transmission of influenza A in Hong Kong was conducted during the pandemic in 2009. The HA and NA sequences of pandemic and seasonal influenza A viral isolates identified in this household transmission study were sequences and analyzed. Our results indicated that there were multiple introductions of influenza viruses into Hong Kong. Sequence analysis of these isolates suggested that members of these family clusters acquired the infection by household transmissions. Interestingly, unlike those concluded from previous household transmission studies, we observed sequence variations between sequential samples from the same person and also within the same household. Family clusters of influenza A viral infection are predominantly the result of secondary transmission within a household. Our results also suggested that the intra-host viral sequence variation might be more common that than previously thought.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on sequence variation and molecular epidemiology without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: IPMiner: a progenitor gene identifier for influenza A virus.
Abstract: Identification of the genetic origin of influenza A viruses will facilitate understanding of the genomic dynamics, evolutionary pathway, and viral fitness of influenza A viruses. The exponential increases of influenza sequences have expanded the coverage of influenza genetic pool, thus potentially reducing the biases for influenza progenitor identification. However, these large amounts of data generate a great challenge in progenitor identification. To increase computational efficiency, IPMiner is developed by integrating complete composition vector for genetic distance calculation and minimum spanning tree algorithm for progenitor identification. IPMiner is available to at http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/IPMiner.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a computational tool for progenitor gene identification without explicit links to viral phenotypes.

Title: Influenza A viruses: new research developments.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are zoonotic pathogens that continuously circulate and change in several animal hosts, including birds, pigs, horses and humans. The emergence of novel virus strains that are capable of causing human epidemics or pandemics is a serious possibility. Here, we discuss the value of surveillance and characterization of naturally occurring influenza viruses, and review the impact that new developments in the laboratory have had on our understanding of the host tropism and virulence of viruses. We also revise the lessons that have been learnt from the pandemic viruses of the past 100 years.

Title: Rapid detection of the H275Y oseltamivir resistance mutation in influenza A/H1N1 2009 by single base pair RT-PCR and high-resolution melting.
Abstract: We aimed to design a real-time reverse-transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR), high-resolution melting (HRM) assay to detect the H275Y mutation that confers oseltamivir resistance in influenza A/H1N1 2009 viruses. A novel strategy of amplifying a single base pair, the relevant SNP at position 823 of the neuraminidase gene, was chosen to maintain specificity of the assay. Wildtype and mutant virus were differentiated when using known reference samples of cell-cultured virus. However, when dilutions of these reference samples were assayed, amplification of non-specific primer-dimer was evident and affected the overall melting temperature (T(m)) of the amplified products. Due to primer-dimer appearance at >30 cycles we found that if the cycle threshold (C(T)) for a dilution was >30, the HRM assay did not consistently discriminate mutant from wildtype. Where the C(T) was <30 we noted an inverse relationship between C(T) and T(m) and fitted quadratic curves allowed the discrimination of wildtype, mutant and 30∶70 mutant∶wildtype virus mixtures. We compared the C(T) values for a TaqMan H1N1 09 detection assay with those for the HRM assay using 59 clinical samples and demonstrated that samples with a TaqMan detection assay C(T)>32.98 would have an H275Y assay C(T)>30. Analysis of the TaqMan C(T) values for 609 consecutive clinical samples predicted that 207 (34%) of the samples would result in an HRM assay C(T)>30 and therefore not be amenable to the HRM assay. The use of single base pair PCR and HRM can be useful for specifically interrogating SNPs. When applied to H1N1 09, the constraints this placed on primer design resulted in amplification of primer-dimer products. The impact primer-dimer had on HRM curves was adjusted for by plotting T(m) against C(T). Although less sensitive than TaqMan assays, the HRM assay can rapidly, and at low cost, screen samples with moderate viral concentrations.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on detection of a specific resistance mutation using PCR and melting curve analysis but does not explore phenotypic consequences or explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Evolutionary analysis of inter-farm transmission dynamics in a highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic.
Abstract: Phylogenetic studies have largely contributed to better understand the emergence, spread and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza during epidemics, but sampling of genetic data has never been detailed enough to allow mapping of the spatiotemporal spread of avian influenza viruses during a single epidemic. Here, we present genetic data of H7N7 viruses produced from 72% of the poultry farms infected during the 2003 epidemic in the Netherlands. We use phylogenetic analyses to unravel the pathways of virus transmission between farms and between infected areas. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary processes shaping viral genetic diversity, and assess how they could have affected our phylogenetic analyses. Our results show that the H7N7 virus was characterized by a high level of genetic diversity driven mainly by a high neutral substitution rate, purifying selection and limited positive selection. We also identified potential reassortment in the three genes that we have tested, but they had only a limited effect on the resolution of the inter-farm transmission network. Clonal sequencing analyses performed on six farm samples showed that at least one farm sample presented very complex virus diversity and was probably at the origin of chronological anomalies in the transmission network. However, most virus sequences could be grouped within clearly defined and chronologically sound clusters of infection and some likely transmission events between farms located 0.8-13 Km apart were identified. In addition, three farms were found as most likely source of virus introduction in distantly located new areas. These long distance transmission events were likely facilitated by human-mediated transport, underlining the need for strict enforcement of biosafety measures during outbreaks. This study shows that in-depth genetic analysis of virus outbreaks at multiple scales can provide critical information on virus transmission dynamics and can be used to increase our capacity to efficiently control epidemics.

Title: Comparative sequence, antigenic and phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza (H9N2) surface proteins isolated in Pakistan between 1999 and 2008.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses possess a unique genomic structure which leads to genetic instability, especially in products of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes. These surface proteins play major roles in viral entry and release, and in the activation of the host immune system. This study involved an in silico sequence, phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins of avian influenza A (H9N2) strains that circulated in Pakistan's poultry flocks from 1999 to 2008 and determined variations among these sequences at different levels. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed a large number of similar substitution mutations and close evolutionary relation among sequences of both proteins. Changes were observed in the N-glycosylation sites of both surface proteins, along with the appearance of a new glycosylation site in the neuraminidase sequence isolated in 2007. Epitopes for hemagglutinin remained conserved, whereas for neuraminidase, epitopes from older strains reappeared in present sequences. Because of the rapid mutating nature of avian influenza subtype H9N2, constant surveillance of annual sequence variations is important. Preventive measures and vaccine products can be evaluated by keeping track of changes that may lead to reassortment among different circulating strains in Pakistan's commercial poultry flocks or in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study performs sequence, antigenic, and phylogenetic analyses but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Purifying selection can obscure the ancient age of viral lineages.
Abstract: Statistical methods for molecular dating of viral origins have been used extensively to infer the time of most common recent ancestor for many rapidly evolving pathogens. However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses molecular dating and purifying selection effects on viral phylogenies but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Expression of duck CCL19 and CCL21 and CCR7 receptor in lymphoid and influenza-infected tissues.
Abstract: Ducks are the natural host and reservoir of influenza viruses. We are interested in their immune responses to these viruses, to understand host-pathogen interactions and to develop effective agricultural vaccines. We identified duck homologues of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 and cloned their cognate receptor, CCR7. Conservation of key features, and expression in lymphoid tissues suggests that these chemokines are the direct orthologues of their mammalian counterparts. Mammalian CCL19 and CCL21 are responsible for the homing of dendritic cells and naïve lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues. The contribution of local tertiary lymphoid tissues may be important during influenza infection in ducks. Consistent with leukocyte recruitment, CCL19 and CCL21 transcripts are abundant in lung tissues at 1 day post-infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) (VN1203). In contrast, expression in lung or intestine tissues infected with low pathogenic A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) (BC500) is not significant. Recruitment and aggregation of leukocytes is visible in the vicinity of major airways 3 days after infection with VN1203. Chemokine gene expression may serve as a useful marker to evaluate duck immune responses to natural infections and vaccine strains.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on expression of host immune genes in response to influenza infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: An H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus isolated from a local tree sparrow in Indonesia.
Abstract: The isolation of an H5N1 influenza A virus from a tree sparrow (Passer montanus) captured in East Java, Indonesia in 2010 is reported here. Its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were genetically similar to those of human isolates from 2006-2007 in Indonesia. The finding of a tree sparrow H5N1 virus that possesses genetically similar surface molecules to those of human viruses highlights the importance of monitoring resident wild birds, as well as migratory birds, for pandemic preparedness.

Title: Extensive geographic mosaicism in avian influenza viruses from gulls in the northern hemisphere.
Abstract: Due to limited interaction of migratory birds between Eurasia and America, two independent avian influenza virus (AIV) gene pools have evolved. There is evidence of low frequency reassortment between these regions, which has major implications in global AIV dynamics. Indeed, all currently circulating lineages of the PB1 and PA segments in North America are of Eurasian origin. Large-scale analyses of intercontinental reassortment have shown that viruses isolated from Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, and shorebirds) are the major contributor of these outsider events. To clarify the role of gulls in AIV dynamics, specifically in movement of genes between geographic regions, we have sequenced six gull AIV isolated in Alaska and analyzed these along with 142 other available gull virus sequences. Basic investigations of host species and the locations and times of isolation reveal biases in the available sequence information. Despite these biases, our analyses reveal a high frequency of geographic reassortment in gull viruses isolated in America. This intercontinental gene mixing is not found in the viruses isolated from gulls in Eurasia. This study demonstrates that gulls are important as vectors for geographically reassorted viruses, particularly in America, and that more surveillance effort should be placed on this group of birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes geographic reassortment and genetic diversity in gull influenza viruses without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Spatial dynamics of human-origin H1 influenza A virus in North American swine.
Abstract: The emergence and rapid global spread of the swine-origin H1N1/09 pandemic influenza A virus in humans underscores the importance of swine populations as reservoirs for genetically diverse influenza viruses with the potential to infect humans. However, despite their significance for animal and human health, relatively little is known about the phylogeography of swine influenza viruses in the United States. This study utilizes an expansive data set of hemagglutinin (HA1) sequences (n = 1516) from swine influenza viruses collected in North America during the period 2003-2010. With these data we investigate the spatial dissemination of a novel influenza virus of the H1 subtype that was introduced into the North American swine population via two separate human-to-swine transmission events around 2003. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis reveals that the spatial dissemination of this influenza virus in the US swine population follows long-distance swine movements from the Southern US to the Midwest, a corn-rich commercial center that imports millions of swine annually. Hence, multiple genetically diverse influenza viruses are introduced and co-circulate in the Midwest, providing the opportunity for genomic reassortment. Overall, the Midwest serves primarily as an ecological sink for swine influenza in the US, with sources of virus genetic diversity instead located in the Southeast (mainly North Carolina) and South-central (mainly Oklahoma) regions. Understanding the importance of long-distance pig transportation in the evolution and spatial dissemination of the influenza virus in swine may inform future strategies for the surveillance and control of influenza, and perhaps other swine pathogens.

Title: PhyloMap: an algorithm for visualizing relationships of large sequence data sets and its application to the influenza A virus genome.
Abstract: Results of phylogenetic analysis are often visualized as phylogenetic trees. Such a tree can typically only include up to a few hundred sequences. When more than a few thousand sequences are to be included, analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among them becomes a challenging task. The recent frequent outbreaks of influenza A viruses have resulted in the rapid accumulation of corresponding genome sequences. Currently, there are more than 7500 influenza A virus genomes in the database. There are no efficient ways of representing this huge data set as a whole, thus preventing a further understanding of the diversity of the influenza A virus genome. Here we present a new algorithm, "PhyloMap", which combines ordination, vector quantization, and phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant representation of a large sequence data set. The use of PhyloMap on influenza A virus genome sequences reveals the phylogenetic relationships of the internal genes that cannot be seen when only a subset of sequences are analyzed. The application of PhyloMap to influenza A virus genome data shows that it is a robust algorithm for analyzing large sequence data sets. It utilizes the entire data set, minimizes bias, and provides intuitive visualization. PhyloMap is implemented in JAVA, and the source code is freely available at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/public/software/phylomap.html.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenicity H5N1 and H7N3 influenza A virus isolates recovered from sentinel, free flying, wild mallards at one study site during 2006.
Abstract: From August 2 to October 11, 2006, clusters of low pathogenicity (LP) North American lineage H5N1 and H7N3 avian influenza A viruses (AIV), and other subtypes, were recovered from free-flying, resident, wild mallards used as sentinels at one site. The antigenic subtypes, pathogenicity potential, and Sanger sequencing of the isolates determined the H5N1 and H7N3 isolates were only recovered from samples collected on 8/2/2006 and 9/8/2006, respectively. However, subsequent efforts using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and additional Sanger sequencing found partial H7 segments in other HA-NA virus combinations on 8/2/2006, 9/8/2006 and 10/11/2006. It is well established that over larger geographic areas and years AIVs form transient genomic constellations; this sequential sampling data revealed that over a short period of time the dynamics of AIVs can be active and newer sequencing platforms increase recognition of mixed infections. Both findings provide further insight into the natural history of AIVs in natural reservoirs.
Relevant: False

Title: Peptide inhibitors against influenza virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus is a particularly problematic virus because of its ability to cause high levels of morbidity on a global scale within a remarkably short period of time. It also has the potential to kill very large numbers of people as occurred in the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918. Options for antiviral therapy are limited because of the paucity of available drugs and the rapid mutation rate of the virus leading to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The current H1N1 pandemic and potential threats posed by other strains highlight the need to develop novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Here, we summarize the current state and recent developments of peptide-based inhibitors of influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review summarizing peptide inhibitors against influenza virus, focusing on therapeutic development rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Extensive geographical mixing of 2009 human H1N1 influenza A virus in a single university community.
Abstract: Despite growing interest in the molecular epidemiology of influenza virus, the pattern of viral spread within individual communities remains poorly understood. To determine the phylogeography of influenza virus in a single population, we examined the spatial diffusion of H1N1/09 influenza A virus within the student body of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), sampling for a 1-month period between October and November 2009. Despite the highly focused nature of our study, an analysis of complete viral genome sequences revealed between 24 and 33 independent introductions of H1N1/09 into the UCSD community, comprising much of the global genetic diversity in this virus. These data were also characterized by a relatively low level of on-campus transmission as well as extensive spatial mixing, such that there was little geographical clustering by either student residence or city ZIP code. Most notably, students experiencing illness on the same day and residing in the same dorm possessed phylogenetically distinct lineages. H1N1/09 influenza A virus is therefore characterized by a remarkable spatial fluidity, which is likely to impede community-based methods for its control, including class cancellations, quarantine, and chemoprophylaxis.
Relevant: False

Title: Universal oligonucleotide microarray for sub-typing of Influenza A virus.
Abstract: A universal microchip was developed for genotyping Influenza A viruses. It contains two sets of oligonucleotide probes allowing viruses to be classified by the subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1-H13, H15, H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9). Additional sets of probes are used to detect H1N1 swine influenza viruses. Selection of probes was done in two steps. Initially, amino acid sequences specific to each subtype were identified, and then the most specific and representative oligonucleotide probes were selected. Overall, between 19 and 24 probes were used to identify each subtype of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Genotyping included preparation of fluorescently labeled PCR amplicons of influenza virus cDNA and their hybridization to microarrays of specific oligonucleotide probes. Out of 40 samples tested, 36 unambiguously identified HA and NA subtypes of Influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on developing a microarray for genotyping Influenza A virus subtypes but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Outbreak of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 in Nepal.
Abstract: The 2009 flu pandemic is a global outbreak of a new strain of H1N1 influenza virus. Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 has posed a serious public health challenge world-wide. Nepal has started Laboratory diagnosis of Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 from mid June 2009 though active screening of febrile travellers with respiratory symptoms was started from April 27, 2009. Out of 609 collected samples, 302 (49.6%) were Universal Influenza A positive. Among the influenza A positive samples, 172(28.3%) were positive for Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and 130 (21.3%) were Seasonal influenza A. Most of the pandemic cases (53%) were found among young people with ≤ 20 years. Case Fatality Ratio for Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in Nepal was 1.74%. Upon Molecular characterization, all the isolated pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus found in Nepal were antigenically and genetically related to the novel influenza A/CALIFORNIA/07/2009-LIKE (H1N1)v type. The Pandemic 2009 influenza virus found in Nepal were antigenically and genetically related to the novel A/CALIFORNIA/07/2009-LIKE (H1N1)v type.

Title: Genetic characterization of avian influenza subtype H4N6 and H4N9 from live bird market, Thailand.
Abstract: : A one year active surveillance program for influenza A viruses among avian species in a live-bird market (LBM) in Bangkok, Thailand was conducted in 2009. Out of 970 samples collected, influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 (n = 2) and H4N9 (n = 1) were isolated from healthy Muscovy ducks. All three viruses were characterized by whole genome sequencing with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and genetic comparison. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes showed that the viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of influenza A viruses. Genetic analysis showed that H4N6 and H4N9 viruses display low pathogenic avian influenza characteristics. The HA cleavage site and receptor binding sites were conserved and resembled to LPAI viruses. This study is the first to report isolation of H4N6 and H4N9 viruses from birds in LBM in Thailand and shows the genetic diversity of the viruses circulating in the LBM. In addition, co-infection of H4N6 and H4N9 in the same Muscovy duck was observed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of H4N6 and H4N9 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Isolation and complete genomic characterization of H1N1 subtype swine influenza viruses in southern China through the 2009 pandemic.
Abstract: The swine influenza (SI) is an infectious disease of swine and human. The novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) that emerged from April 2009 in Mexico spread rapidly and caused a human pandemic globally. To determine whether the tremendous virus had existed in or transmitted to pigs in southern China, eight H1N1 influenza strains were identified from pigs of Guangdong province during 2008-2009. Based on the homology and phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of each gene segments, the isolates were confirmed to belong to the classical SI group, with HA, NP and NS most similar to 2009 human-like H1N1 influenza virus lineages. All of the eight strains were low pathogenic influenza viruses, had the same host range, and not sensitive to class of antiviral drugs. This study provides the evidence that there is no 2009 H1N1-like virus emerged in southern China, but the importance of swine influenza virus surveillance in China should be given a high priority.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study reports genomic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of swine H1N1 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: A novel method of characterizing genetic sequences: genome space with biological distance and applications.
Abstract: Most existing methods for phylogenetic analysis involve developing an evolutionary model and then using some type of computational algorithm to perform multiple sequence alignment. There are two problems with this approach: (1) different evolutionary models can lead to different results, and (2) the computation time required for multiple alignments makes it impossible to analyse the phylogeny of a whole genome. This motivates us to create a new approach to characterize genetic sequences. To each DNA sequence, we associate a natural vector based on the distributions of nucleotides. This produces a one-to-one correspondence between the DNA sequence and its natural vector. We define the distance between two DNA sequences to be the distance between their associated natural vectors. This creates a genome space with a biological distance which makes global comparison of genomes with same topology possible. We use our proposed method to analyze the genomes of the new influenza A (H1N1) virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV) and mammalian mitochondrial. The result shows that a triple-reassortant swine virus circulating in North America and the Eurasian swine virus belong to the lineage of the influenza A (H1N1) virus. For the HRV and mammalian mitochondrial genomes, the results coincide with biologists' analyses. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for analyzing and annotating genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Whole or partial genomes can be handled more easily and more quickly than using multiple alignment methods. Once a genome space has been constructed, it can be stored in a database. There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for subsequent applications, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed to add new sequences. Furthermore, one can make a global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve.

Reason: The paper presents a novel computational method for genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolution of the haemagglutinin gene of the influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus isolated in Hong Kong, 2009-2011.
Abstract: Phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene shows that the influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses collected in Hong Kong clustered in two main branches characterised by the E391E and E391K amino acids. The main branch E391K evolved in two sub-branches with N142D and S202T mutations that first appeared in March and July 2010, respectively, with the latter becoming the predominant strain. These genetic variants that emerged display similar antigenic characteristics.Concurrent with genetic surveillance, laboratories should continue monitoring the circulating viruses antigenically.

Title: A multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay for influenza surveillance.
Abstract: For surveillance purposes real-time PCR assays for influenza viruses had to be adapted to the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 strain. We combined published primers and probes for influenza A, influenza B and an internal amplification control with a detection system for influenza A(H1N1)2009 to set up a rapid, reliable, simple and cost-effective high-throughput multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR. The workflow also includes automated sample preparation for high-throughput screening. The lower limit of detection of the multiplex assay was 3.5x10(2) RNA copies per PCR reaction. The diagnostic sensitivity of the multiplex assay was 87.7%, but increased to 99.4% for influenza-positive samples yielding C(t) values of less than 34 cycles in the respective diagnostic assay. High specificity was confirmed by sequencing and correct detection of 15 reference samples from two quality assurance studies. The multiplex PCR was introduced for surveillance of samples from a network of general practitioners and paediatricians in Bavaria, Germany during the influenza pandemic of 2009. Comparison with surveillance data from reported cases proved the reliability of the multiplex assay for influenza surveillance programmes.

Title: A generic system for the expression and purification of soluble and stable influenza neuraminidase.
Abstract: The influenza surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) is essential for the efficient spread of the virus. Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) that inhibit NA enzyme activity have been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza infections. The recent 'swine flu' pandemic and world-wide emergence of Tamiflu-resistant seasonal human influenza A(H1N1) H(274)Y have highlighted the need for the ongoing development of new anti-virals, efficient production of vaccine proteins and novel diagnostic tools. Each of these goals could benefit from the production of large quantities of highly pure and stable NA. This publication describes a generic expression system for NAs in a baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) that is capable of expressing milligram amounts of recombinant NA. To construct NAs with increased stability, the natural influenza NA stalk was replaced by two different artificial tetramerization domains that drive the formation of catalytically active NA homotetramers: GCN4-pLI from yeast or the Tetrabrachion tetramerization domain from Staphylothermus marinus. Both recombinant NAs are secreted as FLAG-tagged proteins to allow for rapid and simple purification. The Tetrabrachion-based NA showed good solubility, increased stability and biochemical properties closer to the original viral NA than the GCN4-pLI based construct. The expressed quantities and high quality of the purified recombinant NA suggest that this expression system is capable of producing recombinant NA for a broad range of applications including high-throughput drug screening, protein crystallisation, or vaccine development.

Reason: The paper describes a system for expression and purification of neuraminidase protein without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evaluation of the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) as a screening method for the detection of influenza viruses in the fecal materials of water birds.
Abstract: Migratory water birds are a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. Viruses replicate in the intestines of ducks and are shed with the fecal materials. Virus isolation from collected fecal materials, therefore, is an integral part of the surveillance of avian influenza in water birds. In the present study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was assessed for its usefulness in detecting the RNA of influenza A viruses in fecal materials. It was found that, RT-LAMP specifically and sensitively detects the matrix gene of influenza A viruses. Influenza A viruses were isolated from the fecal materials in which viral RNA were detected by RT-LAMP in 35 min. The present findings indicate that RT-LAMP is useful as a high throughput screening method for field samples prior to virus isolation, allowing the processing of hundreds of samples per day.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on evaluating a detection method (RT-LAMP) for influenza virus RNA in fecal samples, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Upstream start codon in segment 4 of North American H2 avian influenza A viruses.
Abstract: H2N2 influenza A virus was the cause of the 1957 pandemic. Due to its constant presence in birds, the H2 subtype remains a topic of interest. In this work, comparison of H2 leader sequences of influenza A segment 4 revealed the presence of an upstream in-frame start codon in a majority of North American avian strains. This AUG is located seven codons upstream of the conventional start codon and is in a good Kozak context. In vivo experiments, using a luciferase reporter gene fused to leader sequences derived from North American avian H2 strains, support the efficient use of the upstream start codon. These results were corroborated by in vitro translation data using full-length segment 4 mRNA. Phylogenic analyses indicate that the upstream AUG, first detected in 1976, is stably nested in the North American avian lineage of H2 strains nowadays. The possible consequences of the upstream AUG are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses the presence of an upstream start codon in segment 4 of H2 avian influenza viruses and its possible consequences, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A complete analysis of HA and NA genes of influenza A viruses.
Abstract: More and more nucleotide sequences of type A influenza virus are available in public databases. Although these sequences have been the focus of many molecular epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses, most studies only deal with a few representative sequences. In this paper, we present a complete analysis of all Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences available to allow large scale analyses of the evolution and epidemiology of type A influenza. This paper describes an analysis and complete classification of all HA and NA gene sequences available in public databases using multivariate and phylogenetic methods. We analyzed 18,975 HA sequences and divided them into 280 subgroups according to multivariate and phylogenetic analyses. Similarly, we divided 11,362 NA sequences into 202 subgroups. Compared to previous analyses, this work is more detailed and comprehensive, especially for the bigger datasets. Therefore, it can be used to show the full and complex phylogenetic diversity and provides a framework for studying the molecular evolution and epidemiology of type A influenza virus. For more than 85% of type A influenza HA and NA sequences into GenBank, they are categorized in one unambiguous and unique group. Therefore, our results are a kind of genetic and phylogenetic annotation for influenza HA and NA sequences. In addition, sequences of swine influenza viruses come from 56 HA and 45 NA subgroups. Most of these subgroups also include viruses from other hosts indicating cross species transmission of the viruses between pigs and other hosts. Furthermore, the phylogenetic diversity of swine influenza viruses from Eurasia is greater than that of North American strains and both of them are becoming more diverse. Apart from viruses from human, pigs, birds and horses, viruses from other species show very low phylogenetic diversity. This might indicate that viruses have not become established in these species. Based on current evidence, there is no simple pattern of inter-hemisphere transmission of avian influenza viruses and it appears to happen sporadically. However, for H6 subtype avian influenza viruses, such transmissions might have happened very frequently and multiple and bidirectional transmission events might exist.

Reason: This is a large-scale phylogenetic and molecular epidemiological analysis of HA and NA gene sequences without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: The emergence of pandemic influenza viruses.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza has posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide in the last decade. In the 20th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, the evolutionary history of the pandemic viruses has been controversial, largely due to the lack of background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides a unique opportunity to investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into the emergence of this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes the evolutionary pathway of the pandemic viruses. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the early detection and control of future pandemics.

Title: Surveillance of equine respiratory viruses in Ontario.
Abstract: The objective of this project was to develop and implement an active surveillance program for the early and rapid detection of equine influenza viruses in Ontario. For this purpose, from October 2003 to October 2005, nasopharyngeal swabs and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected from 115 client-owned horses in 23 outbreaks of respiratory disease in Ontario. Sera were paired and tested for antibody to equine influenza 1 (AE1-H7N7), equine influenza 2 (AE2-H3N8), equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV1 and EHV4), and equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV). Overall, the cause-specific morbidity rate of equine influenza virus in the respiratory outbreaks was 56.5% as determined by the single radial hemolysis (SRH) test. The AE2-H3N8 was isolated from 15 horses in 5 outbreaks. A 4-fold increase in antibody levels or the presence of a high titer against ERAV or ERBV was observed in 10 out of 13 outbreaks in which AE2-H3N8 was diagnosed as the primary cause of disease. In conclusion, AE2-H3N8 was found to be an important contributor to equine respiratory viral disease. Equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV) represented an important component in the equine respiratory disease of performing horses.

Title: Mongrelised genetics of H1N1 virus: a bird's eyeview.
Abstract: H1N1 influenza, also known as "novel H1N1 virus" has led to a "global outcry." This virus is more virulent when compared with other seasonal flu viruses. Virulence may change as the adaptive mutation gene increases within the virus. A study at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain as they showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction when compared with adults aged 18-64 years, who showed a cross-reactive antibody reaction of 6-9% and older adults with 33% immunity. This review article depicts H1N1 virus, its virulence with genetic evolution potential and preventive protocol for the dental professionals. This would allow us to comprehend the changes in the disease process and contribute in its prevention as "prevention is better than cure."

Title: Iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of influenza A virus infection.
Abstract: The 2009 flu pandemic and the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza strains highlight the need for treatment alternatives. One such option is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity. In vitro tests demonstrated that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of influenza A virus infection, most importantly also of pandemic H1N1/2009 in vitro. Consequently, we tested a commercially available nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in an influenza A mouse infection model. Treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A PR8/34 H1N1 virus with iota-carrageenan starting up to 48 hours post infection resulted in a strong protection of mice similar to mice treated with oseltamivir. Since alternative treatment options for influenza are rare, we conclude that the nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan is an alternative to neuraminidase inhibitors and should be tested for prevention and treatment of influenza A in clinical trials in humans.

Title: GiRaF: robust, computational identification of influenza reassortments via graph mining.
Abstract: Reassortments in the influenza virus--a process where strains exchange genetic segments--have been implicated in two out of three pandemics of the 20th century as well as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of whole-genome sequences that are available, an understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the paucity of automated tools for confident identification of reassortments from sequence data due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We describe here a novel computational method, called GiRaF (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies reassortments in a fully automated fashion while accounting for uncertainties in the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-sampled trees for groups of incompatible splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with several statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic placement. GiRaF correctly finds known reassortments in human, avian, and swine influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 'swine flu' outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported reassortments via whole-genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine influenza isolates.

Title: Swine influenza viruses isolated in 1983, 2002 and 2009 in Sweden exemplify different lineages.
Abstract: Swine influenza virus isolates originating from outbreaks in Sweden from 1983, 2002 and 2009 were subjected to nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The aim of the studies was to obtain an overview on their potential relatedness as well as to provide data for broader scale studies on swine influenza epidemiology. Nonetheless, analyzing archive isolates is justified by the efforts directed to the comprehension of the appearance of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Interestingly, this study illustrates the evolution of swine influenza viruses in Europe, because the earliest isolate belonged to 'classical' swine H1N1, the subsequent ones to Eurasian 'avian-like' swine H1N1 and reassortant 'avian-like' swine H1N2 lineages, respectively. The latter two showed close genetic relatedness regarding their PB2, HA, NP, and NS genes, suggesting common ancestry. The study substantiates the importance of molecular surveillance for swine influenza viruses.

Title: Emergency surveillance of influenza during 2009 in the Chinese city of Qingdao.
Abstract: In April, 2009, a new influenza pandemic caused by a swine-origin H1N1 subtype influenza virus was imminent. We thereby carried out an emergency surveillance study in a Chinese city of Qingdao. Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from four targeted groups and tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Each laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 case or cluster was investigated, and the hemagglutinin genes of some of the viruses were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 140 pandemic H1N1 cases including 92 from 7 clusters were identified in the four targeted groups. None of them developed into severe infections. Meanwhile, 103 cases of seasonal influenza (98 H3N2 and 5 H1N1) and 10 clusters of seasonal H3N2 influenza were also identified. Among them, 38 pandemic H1N1 and two seasonal H3N2 influenza cases were air travellers, suggesting that air travel facilitates the spread of pandemic and seasonal influenza even in the northern hemisphere summer. In addition, it was found that pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses co-circulated in two clusters. No significant mutations were found in the hemagglutinin gene sequences of pandemic H1N1 viruses, but the seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses have become genetically distinguishable from those circulating in 2007-2008.

Title: Network analysis of global influenza spread.
Abstract: Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection, strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.

Title: Surveillance and analysis of avian influenza viruses, Australia.
Abstract: We investigated carriage of avian influenza viruses by wild birds in Australia, 2005-2008, to assess the risks to poultry industries and human health. We collected 21,858 (7,357 cloacal, 14,501 fecal) samples and detected 300 viruses, representing a detection rate of ≈1.4%. Rates were highest in autumn (March-May) and differed substantially between bird types, areas, and years. We typed 107 avian influenza viruses and identified 19 H5, 8 H7, and 16 H9 (40% of typed viruses). All were of low pathogenicity. These viruses formed clearly different phylogenetic clades to lineages from Eurasia or North America, suggesting the potential existence of Australian lineages. H7 viruses were similar to highly pathogenic H7 strains that caused outbreaks in poultry in Australia. Several periods of increased detection rates (numbers or subtypes of viruses) were identified. This study demonstrates the need for ongoing surveillance to detect emerging pathogenic strains and facilitate prevention of outbreaks.
Relevant: False

Title: Surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Recent demand for increased understanding of avian influenza virus in its natural hosts, together with the development of high-throughput diagnostics, has heralded a new era in wildlife disease surveillance. However, survey design, sampling, and interpretation in the context of host populations still present major challenges. We critically reviewed current surveillance to distill a series of considerations pertinent to avian influenza virus surveillance in wild birds, including consideration of what, when, where, and how many to sample in the context of survey objectives. Recognizing that wildlife disease surveillance is logistically and financially constrained, we discuss pragmatic alternatives for achieving probability-based sampling schemes that capture this host-pathogen system. We recommend hypothesis-driven surveillance through standardized, local surveys that are, in turn, strategically compiled over broad geographic areas. Rethinking the use of existing surveillance infrastructure can thereby greatly enhance our global understanding of avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases.

Title: The anti-tumor agent, 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), induces IFN-beta-mediated antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo.
Abstract: The 2009 outbreak of pandemic H1N1 influenza, increased drug resistance, and the significant delay in obtaining adequate numbers of vaccine doses have heightened awareness of the need to develop new antiviral drugs that can be used prophylactically or therapeutically. Previously, we showed that the experimental anti-tumor drug DMXAA potently induced IFN-β but relatively low TNF-α expression in vitro. This study confirms these findings in vivo and demonstrates further that DMXAA induces potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DMXAA protected RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells from VSV-induced cytotoxicity and moreover, inhibited replication of influenza, including the Tamiflu®-resistant H1N1 influenza A/Br strain, in MDCK cells. In vivo, DMXAA protected WT C57BL/6J but not IFN-β(-/-) mice from lethality induced by the mouse-adapted H1N1 PR8 influenza strain when administered before or after infection. Protection was accompanied by mitigation of weight loss, increased IFN-β mRNA and protein levels in the lung, and significant inhibition of viral replication in vivo early after DMXAA treatment.

Title: Bacterial HA1 vaccine against pandemic H5N1 influenza virus: evidence of oligomerization, hemagglutination, and cross-protective immunity in ferrets.
Abstract: The impending influenza virus pandemic requires global vaccination to prevent large-scale mortality and morbidity, but traditional influenza virus vaccine production is too slow for rapid responses. We have developed bacterial systems for expression and purification of properly folded functional hemagglutinin as a rapid response to emerging pandemic strains. A recombinant H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) hemagglutinin globular domain (HA1) was produced in Escherichia coli under controlled redox refolding conditions. Importantly, the properly folded HA1(1-320), i.e., HA1 lacking amino acids 321 to 330, contained ≥75% functional oligomers without addition of foreign oligomerization sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis mapped the oligomerization signal to the HA1 N-terminal Ile-Cys-Ile residues at positions 3 to 5. The purified HA1 oligomers (but not monomers) bound fetuin and agglutinated red blood cells. Upon immunization of rabbits, the oligomeric HA1(1-320) elicited potent neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses more rapidly than HA1(28-320) containing only monomers. Ferrets vaccinated with oligomeric HA1 (but not monomeric HA1 with the N terminus deleted) at 15 and 3 μg/dose were fully protected from lethality and weight loss after challenge with homologous H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, clade 1) virus, as well as heterologous clade 2.2 H5N1 (A/WooperSwan/Mongolia/244/2005) virus. Protection was associated with a significant reduction in viral loads in the nasal washes of homologous and heterologous virus challenged ferrets. This is the first study that describes the presence of an N-terminal oligomerization sequence in the globular domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin. Our findings suggest that functional oligomeric rHA1-based vaccines can be produced efficiently in bacterial systems and can be easily upscaled in response to a pandemic influenza virus threat.
Relevant: False

Title: Interspecific exchange of avian influenza virus genes in Alaska: the influence of trans-hemispheric migratory tendency and breeding ground sympatry.
Abstract: The movement and transmission of avian influenza viral strains via wild migratory birds may vary by host species as a result of migratory tendency and sympatry with other infected individuals. To examine the roles of host migratory tendency and species sympatry on the movement of Eurasian low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) genes into North America, we characterized migratory patterns and LPAI viral genomic variation in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of Alaska in comparison with LPAI diversity of northern pintails (Anas acuta). A 50-year band-recovery data set suggests that unlike northern pintails, mallards rarely make trans-hemispheric migrations between Alaska and Eurasia. Concordantly, fewer (14.5%) of 62 LPAI isolates from mallards contained Eurasian gene segments compared to those from 97 northern pintails (35%), a species with greater inter-continental migratory tendency. Aerial survey and banding data suggest that mallards and northern pintails are largely sympatric throughout Alaska during the breeding season, promoting opportunities for interspecific transmission. Comparisons of full-genome isolates confirmed near-complete genetic homology (>99.5%) of seven viruses between mallards and northern pintails. This study found viral segments of Eurasian lineage at a higher frequency in mallards than previous studies, suggesting transmission from other avian species migrating inter-hemispherically or the common occurrence of endemic Alaskan viruses containing segments of Eurasian origin. We conclude that mallards are unlikely to transfer Asian-origin viruses directly to North America via Alaska but that they are likely infected with Asian-origin viruses via interspecific transfer from species with regular migrations to the Eastern Hemisphere.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on migratory patterns and viral gene segment exchange without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Phylogeography of the spring and fall waves of the H1N1/09 pandemic influenza virus in the United States.
Abstract: Spatial variation in the epidemiological patterns of successive waves of pandemic influenza virus in humans has been documented throughout the 20th century but never understood at a molecular level. However, the unprecedented intensity of sampling and whole-genome sequencing of the H1N1/09 pandemic virus now makes such an approach possible. To determine whether the spring and fall waves of the H1N1/09 influenza pandemic were associated with different epidemiological patterns, we undertook a large-scale phylogeographic analysis of viruses sampled from three localities in the United States. Analysis of genomic and epidemiological data reveals distinct spatial heterogeneities associated with the first pandemic wave, March to July 2009, in Houston, TX, Milwaukee, WI, and New York State. In Houston, no specific H1N1/09 viral lineage dominated during the spring of 2009, a period when little epidemiological activity was observed in Texas. In contrast, major pandemic outbreaks occurred at this time in Milwaukee and New York State, each dominated by a different viral lineage and resulting from strong founder effects. During the second pandemic wave, beginning in August 2009, all three U.S. localities were dominated by a single viral lineage, that which had been dominant in New York during wave 1. Hence, during this second phase of the pandemic, extensive viral migration and mixing diffused the spatially defined population structure that had characterized wave 1, amplifying the one viral lineage that had dominated early on in one of the world's largest international travel centers.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents phylogeographic and epidemiological analysis without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Exosome-driven antigen transfer for MHC class II presentation facilitated by the receptor binding activity of influenza hemagglutinin.
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation, the transfer of Ag from an infected cell to a professional APC, have been studied in great detail. Much less is known about the equivalent process for MHC class II-restricted presentation. After infection or transfection of class II-negative donor cells, we observed minimal transfer of a proteasome-dependent "class I-like" epitope within the influenza neuraminidase glycoprotein but potent transfer of a classical, H-2M-dependent epitope within the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Additional experiments determined transfer to be exosome-mediated and substantially enhanced by the receptor binding activity of incorporated HA. Furthermore, a carrier effect was observed in that incorporated HA improved exosome-mediated transfer of a second membrane protein. This route of Ag presentation should be relevant to other enveloped viruses, may skew CD4(+) responses toward exosome-incorporated glycoproteins, and points toward novel vaccine strategies.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on antigen transfer mechanisms related to influenza hemagglutinin but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Combining spatial-temporal and phylogenetic analysis approaches for improved understanding on global H5N1 transmission.
Abstract: Since late 2003, the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 had initiated several outbreak waves that swept across the Eurasia and Africa continents. Getting prepared for reassortment or mutation of H5N1 viruses has become a global priority. Although the spreading mechanism of H5N1 has been studied from different perspectives, its main transmission agents and spread route problems remain unsolved. Based on a compilation of the time and location of global H5N1 outbreaks from November 2003 to December 2006, we report an interdisciplinary effort that combines the geospatial informatics approach with a bioinformatics approach to form an improved understanding on the transmission mechanisms of H5N1 virus. Through a spherical coordinate based analysis, which is not conventionally done in geographical analyses, we reveal obvious spatial and temporal clusters of global H5N1 cases on different scales, which we consider to be associated with two different transmission modes of H5N1 viruses. Then through an interdisciplinary study of both geographic and phylogenetic analysis, we obtain a H5N1 spreading route map. Our results provide insight on competing hypotheses as to which avian hosts are responsible for the spread of H5N1. We found that although South China and Southeast Asia may be the virus pool of avian flu, East Siberia may be the source of the H5N1 epidemic. The concentration of migratory birds from different places increases the possibility of gene mutation. Special attention should be paid to East Siberia, Middle Siberia and South China for improved surveillance of H5N1 viruses and monitoring of migratory birds.

Reason: The study combines spatial-temporal and phylogenetic analyses to understand H5N1 transmission routes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Low-dimensional clustering detects incipient dominant influenza strain clusters.
Abstract: Influenza has been circulating in the human population and has caused three pandemics in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2). The 2009 A(H1N1) was classified by World Health Organization as the fourth pandemic. Influenza has a high evolution rate, which makes vaccine design challenging. We here consider an approach for early detection of new dominant strains. By clustering the 2009 A(H1N1) sequence data, we found two main clusters. We then define a metric to detect the emergence of dominant strains. We show on historical H3N2 data that this method is able to identify a cluster around an incipient dominant strain before it becomes dominant. For example, for H3N2 as of 30 March 2009, the method detects the cluster for the new A/British Columbia/RV1222/2009 strain. This strain detection tool would appear to be useful for annual influenza vaccine selection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on clustering of influenza strains to detect emerging dominant strains but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A matrix gene-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of 2009 pandemic H1N1 and other influenza A viruses in North America.
Abstract: The emergence in humans of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) with similarities to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) caused much concern for both human and animal health as potential for interspecies transmission was initially unknown. The goal of this study was to develop a real-time RT-PCR test for the detection and differentiation of 2009 pH1N1 and endemic influenza A viruses in North America. Matrix (M) gene sequences from U.S. human pH1N1 cases and U.S. SIVs were aligned to determine a suitable region for an assay target. Primers were selected to amplify all influenza A. Two probes were designed to differentiate pH1N1 (EA matrix) from endemic (NA matrix) SIVs. The assay was validated using the first U.S. pH1N1 strain, 10 human pH1N1-positive specimens and nine U.S. SIV isolates, then evaluated on 165 specimens of swine and other animal origin submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results were compared to other influenza A PCR assays. Sequences from additional pH1N1 strains and contemporary H1N1 SIVs were used to assess robustness of the selected primers and probes for the intended purpose. The new assay's results from clinical specimens concurred with confirmatory PCR testing. The additional probe designed from sequence analysis improved detection of the NA matrix subtype when added to the reaction mixture. This assay detects and differentiates pH1N1 and US influenza A viruses in various sample matrices and species. Good bioinformatics support is critical when designing RT-PCR assays and monitoring their performance.

Title: The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects influenza A and types simultaneously for influenza A H1N1 (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009).
Abstract: Influenza A H1N1 (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of influenza A and differentiation of influenza A H1N1 (2009) and seasonal influenza A is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of influenza A H1N1 (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all influenza A viruses and type simultaneously for influenza A H1N1 (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of influenza A, influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for influenza A this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing.

Title: Surveillance of avian influenza virus in migratory water birds in eastern Hokkaido, Japan.
Abstract: The epidemiological information has obtained on avian influenza virus (AIV) in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, where AIV surveillance has not been performed. Cloacal or fecal samples obtained from migratory water birds were screened for AIV both by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the influenza A virus matrix (M) gene and by egg inoculation. Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 2,488 samples were collected from various avian species in Abashiri, Kushiro, Nemuro and Tokachi districts of eastern Hokkaido. AIVs were isolated from 18 of those samples (0.7%). No AIV was isolated from the 1,449 samples collected in Abashiri, Kushiro and Nemuro districts, although 6 were positive for the M gene by RRT-PCR. In contrast, 52 (5.0%) of the 1,039 samples collected from ducks in Tokachi district were M gene positive; AIVs were isolated from 18 of those samples (1.7%). The isolates included H3N5 (1 isolate), H3N6 (1), H3N8 (9), H4N2 (1), H4N6 (2), H6N5 (1), H6N8 (1), and H11N3 (2) subtypes. H3N5 and H11N3 subtypes have not been frequently isolated, and our study is the first to report H3N5 and the second to report H11N3 in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the M genes of all isolates belonged to the Eurasian lineage.

Title: Insights into the evolution and emergence of a novel infectious disease.
Abstract: Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if R₀ = 1.4 or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.

Title: Evolutionary entropy determines invasion success in emergent epidemics.
Abstract: Standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number (R0) of the individual strains. A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. We show that the quantity R0 is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on R0 as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine flu outbreak.

Title: Evolution of canine and equine influenza (H3N8) viruses co-circulating between 2005 and 2008.
Abstract: Influenza virus, subtype H3N8, was transmitted from horses to greyhound dogs in 2004 and subsequently spread to pet dog populations. The co-circulation of H3N8 viruses in dogs and horses makes bi-directional virus transmission between these animal species possible. To understand the dynamics of viral transmission, we performed virologic surveillance in dogs and horses between 2005 and 2008 in the United States. The genomes of influenza A H3N8 viruses isolated from 36 dogs and horses were sequenced to determine their origin and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that H3N8 influenza viruses from horses and dogs were monophyletic and distinct. There was no evidence of canine influenza virus infection in horses with respiratory disease or new introductions of equine influenza viruses into dogs in the United States. Analysis of a limited number of equine influenza viruses suggested substantial separation in the transmission of viruses causing clinically apparent influenza in dogs and horses.

Title: Genetic divergence of influenza A NS1 gene in pandemic 2009 H1N1 isolates with respect to H1N1 and H3N2 isolates from previous seasonal epidemics.
Abstract: The Influenza A pandemic sustained by a new H1N1 variant (H1N1v) started in Mexico and the USA at the end of April 2009 spreading worldwide in a few weeks. In this study we investigate the variability of the NS1 gene of the pandemic H1N1v strain with respect to previous seasonal strains circulating in humans and the potential selection of virus variants through isolation in cell culture. During the period April 27th 2009-Jan 15th 2010, 1633 potential 2009 H1N1v cases have been screened at our center using the CDC detection and typing realtime RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation on MDCK cells was systematically performed in 1/10 positive cases. A subset of 51 H1N1v strains isolated in the period May-September 2009 was selected for NS1 gene sequencing. In addition, 15 H1N1 and 47 H3N2 virus isolates from three previous seasonal epidemics (2006-2009) were analyzed in parallel. A low variability in the NS1 amino acid (aa) sequence among H1N1v isolates was shown (aa identity 99.5%). A slightly higher NS1 variability was observed among H1N1 and H3N2 strains from previous epidemics (aa identity 98.6% and 98.9%, respectively). The H1N1v strains were closely related (aa identity 92.1%) to swine reference strain (A/swine/Oklahoma/042169/2008). In contrast, substantial divergence (aa identity 83.4%) with respect to human reference strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 and previous epidemic strains H1N1 and H3N2 (aa identity 78.9% and 77.6%, respectively) was shown. Specific sequence signatures of uncertain significance in the new virus variant were a C-terminus deletion and a T215P substitution. The H1N1v NS1 gene was more conserved than that of previous epidemic strains. In addition, a closer genetic identity of H1N1v with the swine than the human reference strains was shown. Hot-spots were shown in the H1N1v NS1 aa sequence whose biologic relevance remains to be investigated.

Title: Distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors on upper and lower respiratory tract in horses and dogs.
Abstract: It is strongly suspected that equine influenza virus (EIV) is the origin of canine influenza virus (CIV, H3N8), which was first isolated in U.S.A. in 2004, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses. Although the distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors seems to be associated with this interspecies transmission, there have been scant data of comparison about distributions of sialoreceptors on the whole respiratory tract between horses and dogs. We examined the histological distribution of influenza virus sialoreceptors on the upper and lower respiratory tract in detail in both animals using double lectin staining with Maackia amurensis (specific for SAα2,3Gal) and Sambucus sieboldiana (specific for SAα2,6Gal). SAα2,3Gal was observed on the surface of ciliated epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa, trachea and bronchus in both animals. The results may indicate that dogs are susceptible to EIV without alteration of receptor binding specificity.

Title: Attaching zanamivir to a polymer markedly enhances its activity against drug-resistant strains of influenza a virus.
Abstract: Effects of the commercial drug zanamivir (Relenza) covalently attached to poly-l-glutamine on the infectivity of influenza A viruses are examined using the plaque reduction assay and binding affinity to viral neuraminidase (NA). These multivalent drug conjugates exhibit (i) up to a 20,000-fold improvement in anti-influenza potency compared with the zanamivir parent against human and avian viral strains, including both wild-type and drug-resistant mutants, and (ii) superior neuraminidase (NA) inhibition constants, especially for the mutants.

Title: What happened after the initial global spread of pandemic human influenza virus A (H1N1)? A population genetics approach.
Abstract: Viral population evolution dynamics of influenza A is crucial for surveillance and control. In this paper we analyzed viral genetic features during the recent pandemic caused by the new influenza human virus A H1N1, using a conventional population genetics approach based on 4689 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences available in GenBank submitted between March and December of 2009. This analysis showed several relevant aspects: a) a scarce initial genetic variability within the viral isolates from some countries that increased along 2009 when influenza was dispersed around the world; b) a worldwide virus polarized behavior identified when comparing paired countries, low differentiation and high gene flow were found in some pairs and high differentiation and moderate or scarce gene flow in others, independently of their geographical closeness, c) lack of positive selection in HA and NA due to increase of the population size of virus variants, d) HA and NA variants spread in a few months all over the world being identified in the same countries in different months along 2009, and e) containment of viral variants in Mexico at the beginning of the outbreak, probably due to the control measures applied by the government.

Title: Codon usage bias and the evolution of influenza A viruses. Codon Usage Biases of Influenza Virus.
Abstract: The influenza A virus is an important infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and was responsible for 3 pandemics in the 20th century. As the replication of the influenza virus is based on its host's machinery, codon usage of its viral genes might be subject to host selection pressures, especially after interspecies transmission. A better understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive responses might help control this disease. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values of the genes from segment 1 to segment 6 of avian and human influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1, were studied via Correspondence Analysis (CA). The codon usage patterns of seasonal human influenza viruses were distinct among their subtypes and different from those of avian viruses. Newly isolated viruses could be added to the CA results, creating a tool to investigate the host origin and evolution of viral genes. It was found that the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus contained genes with mammalian-like viral codon usage patterns, indicating that the introduction of this virus to humans was not through in toto transfer of an avian influenza virus.Many human viral genes had directional changes in codon usage over time of viral isolation, indicating the effect of host selection pressures. These changes reduced the overall GC content and the usage of G at the third codon position in the viral genome. Limited evidence of translational selection pressure was found in a few viral genes. Codon usage patterns from CA allowed identification of host origin and evolutionary trends in influenza viruses, providing an alternative method and a tool to understand the evolution of influenza viruses. Human influenza viruses are subject to selection pressure on codon usage which might assist in understanding the characteristics of newly emerging viruses.

Title: Transmission and reassortment of avian influenza viruses at the Asian-North American interface.
Abstract: Twenty avian influenza viruses were isolated from seven wild migratory bird species sampled at St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. We tested predictions based on previous phylogenetic analyses of avian influenza viruses that support spatially dependent trans-hemispheric gene flow and frequent interspecies transmission at a location situated at the Asian-North American interface. Through the application of phylogenetic and genotypic approaches, our data support functional dilution by distance of trans-hemispheric reassortants and interspecific virus transmission. Our study confirms infection of divergent avian taxa with nearly identical avian influenza strains in the wild. Findings also suggest that H16N3 viruses may contain gene segments with unique phylogenetic positions and that further investigation of how host specificity may impact transmission of H13 and H16 viruses is warranted.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, 2009-10 season.
Abstract: During the 2009-10 influenza season, the second wave of influenza activity from 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred in the United States; few seasonal influenza viruses were detected. Influenza activity peaked in late-October and was associated with higher pediatric mortality and higher rates of hospitalizations in children and young adults than in previous seasons. The proportion of visits to health-care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI), as reported in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), was among the highest since ILI surveillance began in 1997 in its current form. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2009-10 influenza season (August 30, 2009-June 12, 2010).

Abstract: Full-genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolate (all subtype H7) has enabled comparison of the sequences of each of the genome segments to those of other subtype H7 avian influenza A viruses. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution that is, in this instance, associated with geographic regions. On the basis of the analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, in conjunction with the occurrence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is nearly exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of reassortants arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of H7 avian influenza viruses without explicit links to phenotypes.

Title: Seroprevalence following the second wave of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
Abstract: In April 2009, a new pandemic strain of influenza infected thousands of persons in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly worldwide. During the ensuing summer months, cases ebbed in the Northern Hemisphere while the Southern Hemisphere experienced a typical influenza season dominated by the novel strain. In the fall, a second wave of pandemic H1N1 swept through the United States, peaking in most parts of the country by mid October and returning to baseline levels by early December. The objective was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain by decade of birth among Pittsburgh-area residents. Anonymous blood samples were obtained from clinical laboratories and categorized by decade of birth from 1920-2009. Using hemagglutination-inhibition assays, approximately 100 samples per decade (n = 846) were tested from blood samples drawn on hospital and clinic patients in mid-November and early December 2009. Age specific seroprevalences against pandemic H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) were measured and compared to seroprevalences against H1N1 strains that had previously circulated in the population in 2007, 1957, and 1918. (A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Denver/1/1957, and A/South Carolina/1/1918). Stored serum samples from healthy, young adults from 2008 were used as a control group (n = 100). Seroprevalences against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza varied by age group, with children age 10-19 years having the highest seroprevalence (45%), and persons age 70-79 years having the lowest (5%). The baseline seroprevalence among control samples from 18-24 year-olds was 6%. Overall seroprevalence against pandemic H1N1 across all age groups was approximately 21%. After the peak of the second wave of 2009 H1N1, HAI seroprevalence results suggest that 21% of persons in the Pittsburgh area had become infected and developed immunity. Extrapolating to the entire US population, we estimate that at least 63 million persons became infected in 2009. As was observed among clinical cases, this sero-epidemiological study revealed highest infection rates among school-age children.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports seroprevalence data without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Trends in global warming and evolution of matrix protein 2 family from influenza A virus.
Abstract: The global warming is an important factor affecting the biological evolution, and the influenza is an important disease that threatens humans with possible epidemics or pandemics. In this study, we attempted to analyze the trends in global warming and evolution of matrix protein 2 family from influenza A virus, because this protein is a target of anti-flu drug, and its mutation would have significant effect on the resistance to anti-flu drugs. The evolution of matrix protein 2 of influenza A virus from 1959 to 2008 was defined using the unpredictable portion of amino-acid pair predictability. Then the trend in this evolution was compared with the trend in the global temperature, the temperature in north and south hemispheres, and the temperature in influenza A virus sampling site, and species carrying influenza A virus. The results showed the similar trends in global warming and in evolution of M2 proteins although we could not correlate them at this stage of study. The study suggested the potential impact of global warming on the evolution of proteins from influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes evolution of matrix protein 2 in relation to global warming trends but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: OpenFluDB, a database for human and animal influenza virus.
Abstract: Although research on influenza lasted for more than 100 years, it is still one of the most prominent diseases causing half a million human deaths every year. With the recent observation of new highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N7 strains, and the appearance of the influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 swine-like lineage, a collaborative effort to share observations on the evolution of this virus in both animals and humans has been established. The OpenFlu database (OpenFluDB) is a part of this collaborative effort. It contains genomic and protein sequences, as well as epidemiological data from more than 27,000 isolates. The isolate annotations include virus type, host, geographical location and experimentally tested antiviral resistance. Putative enhanced pathogenicity as well as human adaptation propensity are computed from protein sequences. Each virus isolate can be associated with the laboratories that collected, sequenced and submitted it. Several analysis tools including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarity maps enable rapid and efficient mining. The contents of OpenFluDB are supplied by direct user submission, as well as by a daily automatic procedure importing data from public repositories. Additionally, a simple mechanism facilitates the export of OpenFluDB records to GenBank. This resource has been successfully used to rapidly and widely distribute the sequences collected during the recent human swine flu outbreak and also as an exchange platform during the vaccine selection procedure.

Abstract: During swine influenza virus surveillance in pigs in China during 2006-2009, we isolated subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 and found novel reassortment between contemporary swine and avian panzootic viruses. These reassortment events raise concern about generation of novel viruses in pigs, which could have pandemic potential.

Title: Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of H7N3 avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in Pakistan 1995-2004.
Abstract: Avian influenza virus (AIV) infections have caused heavy economic losses to the poultry industry in Pakistan as well as numerous other regions worldwide. The first introduction of H7N3 AIV to Pakistan occurred during 1995, since then H7N3, H9N2 and H5N1 AIVs have each been sporadically isolated. This report evaluates the genetic origin of the H7N3 viruses from Pakistan collected 1995-2004 and how they disseminated within the country. To accomplish this we produced whole genome sequences for 6 H7N3 viruses and data for the HA and NA genes of an additional 7 isolates. All available sequence from H7N3 AIV from Pakistan was included in the analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there were two introductions of H7 into Pakistan and one N3 introduction. Only one of the H7 introductions appears to have become established in poultry in Pakistan, while the other was isolated from two separate outbreaks 6 years apart. The data also shows that reassortment has occurred between H7N3 and H9N2 viruses in the field, likely during co-infection of poultry. Also, with the exception of these few reassortant isolates, all 8 genes in the predominant H7N3 virus lineage have evolved to be phylogenetically distinct. Although rigorous control measures have been implemented in commercial poultry in Pakistan, AIV is sporadically transmitted to poultry and among the different poultry industry compartments (broilers, broiler breeders, table egg layers). Since there is one primary H7 lineage which persists and that has reassorted with the H9N2 AIV in poultry, it suggests that there is a reservoir with some link commercial poultry. On a general level, this offers insight into the molecular ecology of AIV in poultry where the virus has persisted despite vaccination and biosecurity. This data also illustrates the importance of sustained surveillance for AIVs in poultry.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic and phylogenetic analysis of H7N3 viruses and their reassortment but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: The re-emergence of H1N1 influenza virus in 1977: a cautionary tale for estimating divergence times using biologically unrealistic sampling dates.
Abstract: In 1977, H1N1 influenza A virus reappeared after a 20-year absence. Genetic analysis indicated that this strain was missing decades of nucleotide sequence evolution, suggesting an accidental release of a frozen laboratory strain into the general population. Recently, this strain and its descendants were included in an analysis attempting to date the origin of pandemic influenza virus without accounting for the missing decades of evolution. Here, we investigated the effect of using viral isolates with biologically unrealistic sampling dates on estimates of divergence dates. Not accounting for missing sequence evolution produced biased results and increased the variance of date estimates of the most recent common ancestor of the re-emergent lineages and across the entire phylogeny. Reanalysis of the H1N1 sequences excluding isolates with unrealistic sampling dates indicates that the 1977 re-emergent lineage was circulating for approximately one year before detection, making it difficult to determine the geographic source of reintroduction. We suggest that a new method is needed to account for viral isolates with unrealistic sampling dates.

Title: Oseltamivir ring prophylaxis for containment of 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreaks.
Abstract: From June 22 through June 25, 2009, four outbreaks of infection with the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus occurred in Singapore military camps. We report the efficacy of ring chemoprophylaxis (geographically targeted containment by means of prophylaxis) with oseltamivir to control outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 influenza in semiclosed environments. All personnel with suspected infection were tested and clinically isolated if infection was confirmed. In addition, we administered postexposure ring chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir and segregated the affected military units to contain the spread of the virus. All personnel were screened three times weekly both for virologic infection, by means of nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay with sequencing, and for clinical symptoms, by means of questionnaires. A total of 1175 personnel were at risk across the four sites, with 1100 receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis. A total of 75 personnel (6.4%) were infected before the intervention, and 7 (0.6%) after the intervention. There was a significant reduction in the overall reproductive number (the number of new cases attributable to the index case), from 1.91 (95% credible interval, 1.50 to 2.36) before the intervention to 0.11 (95% credible interval, 0.05 to 0.20) after the intervention. Three of the four outbreaks showed a significant reduction in the rate of infection after the intervention. Molecular analysis revealed that all four outbreaks were derived from the New York lineage of the 2009 H1N1 virus and that cases within each outbreak were due to transmission rather than unrelated episodes of infection. Of the 816 personnel treated with oseltamivir who were surveyed, 63 (7.7%) reported mild, nonrespiratory side effects of the drug, with no severe adverse events. Oseltamivir ring chemoprophylaxis, together with prompt identification and isolation of infected personnel, was effective in reducing the impact of outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 influenza in semiclosed settings.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reports on the efficacy of oseltamivir prophylaxis and outbreak control but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Reconstructing disease outbreaks from genetic data: a graph approach.
Abstract: Epidemiology and public health planning will increasingly rely on the analysis of genetic sequence data. In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain. The presented methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.

Title: Molecular evolutionary analysis of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm, May-September, 2009: temporal and spatial spreading profile of the viruses in Japan.
Abstract: In March 2009, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A(H1N1)pdm) emerged in Mexico and the United States. In Japan, since the first outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm in Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures occurred in the middle of May 2009, the virus had spread over 16 of 47 prefectures as of June 4, 2009. We analyzed all-segment concatenated genome sequences of 75 isolates of A(H1N1)pdm viruses in Japan, and compared them with 163 full-genome sequences in the world. Two analyzing methods, distance-based and Bayesian coalescent MCMC inferences were adopted to elucidate an evolutionary relationship of the viruses in the world and Japan. Regardless of the method, the viruses in the world were classified into four distinct clusters with a few exceptions. Cluster 1 was originated earlier than cluster 2, while cluster 2 was more widely spread around the world. The other two clusters (clusters 1.2 and 1.3) were suggested to be distinct reassortants with different types of segment assortments. The viruses in Japan seemed to be a multiple origin, which were derived from approximately 28 transported cases. Twelve cases were associated with monophyletic groups consisting of Japanese viruses, which were referred to as micro-clade. While most of the micro-clades belonged to the cluster 2, the clade of the first cases of infection in Japan originated from cluster 1.2. Micro-clades of Osaka/Kobe and the Fukuoka cases, both of which were school-wide outbreaks, were eradicated. Time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for each micro-clade demonstrated that some distinct viruses were transmitted in Japan between late May and early June, 2009, and appeared to spread nation-wide throughout summer. Our results suggest that many viruses were transmitted from abroad in late May 2009 irrespective of preventive actions against the pandemic influenza, and that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm had become a pandemic stage in June 2009 in Japan.

Title: Inhibitory effects of carbocisteine on type A seasonal influenza virus infection in human airway epithelial cells.
Abstract: Type A human seasonal influenza (FluA) virus infection causes exacerbations of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). l-carbocisteine, a mucolytic agent, reduces the frequency of common colds and exacerbations in COPD. However, the inhibitory effects of l-carbocisteine on FluA virus infection are uncertain. We studied the effects of l-carbocisteine on FluA virus infection in airway epithelial cells. Human tracheal epithelial cells were pretreated with l-carbocisteine and infected with FluA virus (H(3)N(2)). Viral titers in supernatant fluids, RNA of FluA virus in the cells, and concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in supernatant fluids, including IL-6, increased with time after infection. l-carbocisteine reduced viral titers in supernatant fluids, RNA of FluA virus in the cells, the susceptibility to FluA virus infection, and concentrations of cytokines induced by virus infection. The epithelial cells expressed sialic acid with an alpha2,6-linkage (SAalpha2,6Gal), a receptor for human influenza virus on the cells, and l-carbocisteine reduced the expression of SAalpha2,6Gal. l-carbocisteine reduced the number of acidic endosomes from which FluA viral RNA enters into the cytoplasm and reduced the fluorescence intensity from acidic endosomes. Furthermore, l-carbocisteine reduced NF-kappaB proteins including p50 and p65 in the nuclear extracts of the cells. These findings suggest that l-carbocisteine may inhibit FluA virus infection, partly through the reduced expression of the receptor for human influenza virus in the human airway epithelial cells via the inhibition of NF-kappaB and through increasing pH in endosomes. l-carbocisteine may reduce airway inflammation in influenza virus infection.

Title: Influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase membrane glycoproteins.
Abstract: Considerable progress has been made toward understanding the structural basis of the interaction of the two major surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus with their common ligand/substrate: carbohydrate chains terminating in sialic acid. The specificity of virus attachment to target cells is mediated by hemagglutinin, which acquires characteristic changes in its receptor-binding site to switch its host from avian species to humans. Anti-influenza drugs mimic the natural sialic acid substrate of the virus neuraminidase enzyme but utilize the much tighter binding of the drugs for efficacy. Resistance to one of the two main antiviral drugs is differentially acquired by the two distinct subsets of neuraminidase as a consequence of structural differences in the enzyme active site between the two phylogenetic groups.

Title: Ecology of avian influenza viruses in a changing world.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infections result in approximately 500,000 human deaths per year and many more sublethal infections. Wild birds are recognized as the ancestral host of influenza A viruses, and avian viruses have contributed genetic material to most human viruses, including subtypes H5N1 and H1N1. Thus, influenza virus transmission in wild and domestic animals and humans is intimately connected. Here we review how anthropogenic change, including human population growth, land use, climate change, globalization of trade, agricultural intensification, and changes in vaccine technology may alter the evolution and transmission of influenza viruses. Evidence suggests that viral transmission in domestic poultry, spillover to other domestic animals, wild birds and humans, and the potential for subsequent pandemic spread, are all increasing. We highlight four areas in need of research: drivers of viral subtype dynamics; ecological and evolutionary determinants of transmissibility and virulence in birds and humans; the impact of changing land use and climate on hosts, viruses, and transmission; and the impact of influenza viruses on wild bird hosts, including their ability to migrate while shedding virus.

Title: Global migration dynamics underlie evolution and persistence of human influenza A (H3N2).
Abstract: The global migration patterns of influenza viruses have profound implications for the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the disease. We developed a novel approach to reconstruct the genetic history of human influenza A (H3N2) collected worldwide over 1998 to 2009 and used it to infer the global network of influenza transmission. Consistent with previous models, we find that China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of this global network. However, we also find that strains of influenza circulate outside of Asia for multiple seasons, persisting through dynamic migration between northern and southern regions. The USA acts as the primary hub of temperate transmission and, together with China and Southeast Asia, forms the trunk of influenza's evolutionary tree. These findings suggest that antiviral use outside of China and Southeast Asia may lead to the evolution of long-term local and potentially global antiviral resistance. Our results might also aid the design of surveillance efforts and of vaccines better tailored to different geographic regions.

Title: Recent outbreaks of avian influenza in Japan.
Abstract: Recently Japan had three outbreaks of avian influenza (Al) in 2004, 2005 and 2007. An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was recorded in early 2004, the first for 79 years, with four farms being infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1. In 2005, 41 farms were found to be infected with AI virus subtype H5N2. In early 2007, four farms were infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1 again. In all of these outbreaks, the disease was eradicated without resorting to vaccination, through a campaign of culling, movement control of chickens in areas around infected premises, and intensive clinical and serological surveillance. This paper describes the nature of the outbreaks, the eradication measures implemented, clinical and serological surveillance techniques used, and the possible sources of infection.

Title: Guidelines for identifying homologous recombination events in influenza A virus.
Abstract: The rapid evolution of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally through a variety of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal evolution of influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of non-homologous RNA recombination. Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination. Our analysis shows that the IGSP data set contains only two phylogenetically-supported single recombinant sequences and no recombinant clades. In marked contrast, the non-IGSP data show a very large amount of potential recombination. We conclude that the presence of false positive signals in the non-IGSP data is more likely than false negatives in the IGSP data, and that given the evidence to date, homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza A viruses.

Title: Influenza outbreaks during World Youth Day 2008 mass gathering.
Abstract: Influenza outbreaks during mass gatherings have been rarely described, and detailed virologic assessment is lacking. An influenza outbreak occurred during World Youth Day in Sydney, Australia, July 2008 (WYD2008). We assessed epidemiologic data and respiratory samples collected from attendees who sought treatment for influenza-like illness at emergency clinics in Sydney during this outbreak. Isolated influenza viruses were compared with seasonal influenza viruses from the 2008 influenza season. From 100 infected attendees, numerous strains were identified: oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses, oseltamivir-sensitive influenza A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and strains from both influenza B lineages (B/Florida/4/2006-like and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like). Novel viruses were introduced, and pre-WYD2008 seasonal viruses were amplified. Viruses isolated at mass gatherings can have substantial, complex, and unpredictable effects on community influenza activity. Greater flexibility by public health authorities and hospitals is required to appropriately manage and contain these outbreaks.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, August 30, 2009-March 27, 2010, and composition of the 2010-11 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: The emergence and spread of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus resulted in substantial influenza activity in the United States throughout the summer and fall months of 2009, with activity peaking in late October. Activity declined beginning in November 2009 but continued at lower levels through March 2010. The 2009 H1N1 virus remained the dominant circulating influenza virus throughout the season; <1% of characterized viruses were seasonal influenza A (H1), A (H3), and influenza B viruses. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from August 30, 2009, the start of the 2009-10 influenza season, through March 27, 2010, and also reports on the 2010-11 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine strain selection.

Title: In vitro antiviral activity of favipiravir (T-705) against drug-resistant influenza and 2009 A(H1N1) viruses.
Abstract: Favipiravir (T-705) has previously been shown to have a potent antiviral effect against influenza virus and some other RNA viruses in both cell culture and in animal models. Currently, favipiravir is undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of influenza A and B virus infections. In this study, favipiravir was evaluated in vitro for its ability to inhibit the replication of a representative panel of seasonal influenza viruses, the 2009 A(H1N1) strains, and animal viruses with pandemic (pdm) potential (swine triple reassortants, H2N2, H4N2, avian H7N2, and avian H5N1), including viruses which are resistant to the currently licensed anti-influenza drugs. All viruses were tested in a plaque reduction assay with MDCK cells, and a subset was also tested in both yield reduction and focus inhibition (FI) assays. For the majority of viruses tested, favipiravir significantly inhibited plaque formation at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml) (50% effective concentrations [EC(50)s] of 0.19 to 22.48 muM and 0.03 to 3.53 microg/ml), and for all viruses, with the exception of a single dually resistant 2009 A(H1N1) virus, complete inhibition of plaque formation was seen at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml). Due to the 2009 pandemic and increased drug resistance in circulating seasonal influenza viruses, there is an urgent need for new drugs which target influenza. This study demonstrates that favipiravir inhibits in vitro replication of a wide range of influenza viruses, including those resistant to currently available drugs.

Title: Geographical spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 during the 2006 outbreak in Austria.
Abstract: In spring 2006, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 was detected in Austria in 119 dead wild birds. The hemagglutinin cleavage site showed that the amino acid sequence motif was identical to that of the Qinghai lineage. For detailed analysis, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of 27 selected Austrian H5N1 viruses originating from different regions and wild bird species were analyzed phylogenetically, which revealed two clearly separated Austrian subclusters, both belonging to European cluster EMA-1. Subcluster South (SCS) contains virus isolates from the south of Austria as well as from Slovenia, Turkey, Egypt, and Nigeria. The second subcluster, Northwest (SCN), covered a larger group of viruses originating from different locations and wild bird species in the northern and very western parts of Austria, as well as from Bavaria and Switzerland. Surprisingly, virus isolates originating from two mute swans and one wild duck found on the north side of the Alps did not cluster with SCN but with SCS. Together with isolates from Bavarian, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Slovakia, they form a genuine subgroup, named subgroup Bavaria (SGB). This subgroup forms a link to SCN, indicating a spread of the virus from south to north. There has been a general assumption that the generic HPAI introduction route into Europe was from Russia to north Germany, introducing cluster EMA-2 into Europe. Interestingly, our findings support the assumption of an alternative introduction of the HPAI H5N1 virus from Turkey to central Europe, where it spread as cluster EMA-1 during the outbreak of 2006.

Title: Unseasonal transmission of H3N2 influenza A virus during the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic.
Abstract: The initial wave of swine-origin influenza A virus (pandemic H1N1/09) in the United States during the spring and summer of 2009 also resulted in an increased vigilance and sampling of seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), even though they are normally characterized by very low incidence outside of the winter months. To explore the nature of virus evolution during this influenza "off-season," we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of H1N1 and H3N2 sequences sampled during April to June 2009 in New York State. Our analysis revealed that multiple lineages of both viruses were introduced and cocirculated during this time, as is typical of influenza virus during the winter. Strikingly, however, we also found strong evidence for the presence of a large transmission chain of H3N2 viruses centered on the south-east of New York State and which continued until at least 1 June 2009. These results suggest that the unseasonal transmission of influenza A viruses may be more widespread than is usually supposed.

Title: Responding to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza: the role of oseltamivir.
Abstract: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza is affecting countries in all five continents, with most cases so far having been reported in North and South America and Europe, and children and young adults being the most susceptible age groups. To date, the clinical course of disease is typically mild, with low hospitalization and mortality rates. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is susceptible to oseltamivir and, although few clinical data are yet available, current information suggests that treatment with oseltamivir appears to be beneficial. Only isolated cases of resistance to the drug have been reported to date, in keeping with the low frequency observed in clinical studies involving patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses. Current health authority guidelines recommend the use of oseltamivir in infected adults and children who have or are at elevated risk for severe disease, including pregnant women; use during the pandemic in infants < 1 year has also been authorized in Europe and a number of other countries, including the USA and Canada. Before the onset of the current pandemic, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd expanded annual production capacity for oseltamivir to 400 million treatment courses per year to meet anticipated demand. However, during an influenza pandemic, and despite increased production capabilities, resources are nonetheless likely to be initially in short supply. For this reason, Roche, in line with WHO recommendations, has advocated advance stockpiling of antivirals by governments as a pandemic preparedness measure. Between 2004 and December 2009, 350 million treatment courses were supplied to governments worldwide. Support for developing countries has been a priority. Roche has established a cluster of initiatives aimed at increasing access to Tamiflu for the world's developing economies, including, making donations to the WHO, establishing the Tamiflu Reserves Program (TRP) and sub-licensing and manufacturing contracts with local companies in Asia and Africa. Furthermore, Roche has published a document outlining how it would allocate limited supplies of Tamiflu during a pandemic, which are in line with WHO recommendations stating that 'resources should be used to provide the maximum possible health benefit'. Roche is also offering support such as reprocessing of expiring capsule stocks (in development) and shelf-life extension to support governments in the management of their stockpiles. Clinical studies, either sponsored by or supported by Roche, are in progress. These trials are designed to investigate the effectiveness of oseltamivir in patients infected with the pandemic virus in greater depth, and include high-dose studies, assessment of natural and drug-induced resistance, and response to treatment in high-risk populations such as young infants, immunocompromised patients and the severely ill.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews oseltamivir use and pandemic response but does not present explicit genotype-phenotype data.

Title: Oseltamivir in seasonal influenza: cumulative experience in low- and high-risk patients.
Abstract: Seasonal influenza viruses cause annual disease epidemics that affect individuals at low and high risk for secondary illnesses. Influenza vaccines are widely used in high-risk patients to prevent infection, but the protection afforded varies by population; uptake is also limited in some groups. Antiviral drugs for influenza are now readily available. Oseltamivir is the most widely used antiviral for the treatment and prophylaxis of seasonal influenza, and its efficacy and safety are now well established in a variety of populations. In addition to decreasing the severity and duration of the symptoms of influenza, clinical and epidemiological studies demonstrate that oseltamivir significantly reduces the frequency of secondary illnesses and exacerbation of underlying conditions; survival is also significantly improved in seriously ill patients who are hospitalized with severe influenza. Resistant viruses are isolated with a low frequency during oseltamivir treatment (0.33% in adults and 4.0% in children among almost 2000 oseltamivir-treated patients enrolled onto Roche-sponsored clinical trials of oseltamivir treatment during the oseltamivir development programme). However, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in Europe during the 2007-08 season and circulated in the southern and northern hemispheres in 2008-09. No link with oseltamivir usage could be detected, and the clinical impact of these viruses was limited. Oseltamivir-susceptible pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses now predominate in many countries. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, with a similar adverse event profile to placebo.

Title: Intercontinental reassortment and genomic variation of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from northern pintails (Anas acuta) in Alaska: examining the evidence through space and time.
Abstract: Migration and population genetic data for northern pintails (Anas acuta) and phylogenetic analysis of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses from this host in Alaska suggest that northern pintails are involved in ongoing intercontinental transmission of avian influenza. Here, we further refine this conclusion through phylogenetic analyses which demonstrate that detection of foreign lineage gene segments is spatially dependent and consistent through time. Our results show detection of foreign lineage gene segments to be most likely at sample locations on the Alaska Peninsula and least likely along the Southern Alaska Coast. Asian lineages detected at four gene segments persisted across years, suggesting maintenance in avian hosts that migrate to Alaska each year from Asia or in hosts that remain in Alaska throughout the year. Alternatively, live viruses may persist in the environment and re-infect birds in subsequent seasons.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes phylogenetic and spatial patterns of avian influenza viruses but does not explicitly link genotype to phenotype.

Title: A family of non-classical pseudoknots in influenza A and B viruses.
Abstract: A very conserved pseudoknot structure has been shown to fold in influenza virus RNA. The pseudoknot encompasses the 3' splice site of segment 8 RNA in both influenza A and B viruses. By sequence comparison of influenza virus strains, we derive a consensus motif that defines a novel RNA pseudoknot family. The orientation of the coaxially stacked stems in the influenza pseudoknot differs from that in classical H-pseudoknots. Apart from the size of the loops, the topology of the influenza pseudoknot resembles that of some long-range pseudoknotted conformations. A seed alignment of the influenza pseudoknot family, containing representative strain sequences together with a consensus structure description, has been submitted to the RNA families (Rfam) database.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on RNA pseudoknot structures in influenza virus RNA without discussing viral genotypes or phenotypes or their relationship.

Title: Avian influenza--a review for doctors in travel medicine.
Abstract: First identified in humans in Hong Kong, influenza A/H5N1, known commonly as avian influenza, has caused human disease in 15 countries around the world. Although the current number of confirmed patients is tiny compared to seasonal and the recently emerged H1N1 'swine' influenza, H5N1 remains a candidate for the next highly pathogenic influenza pandemic. Currently, H5N1 has very limited ability to spread from person-to-person but this may change because of mutation or reassortment with other influenza viruses leading to an influenza pandemic with high mortality. If this occurs travellers are likely to be affected and travel medicine doctors will need to consider avian influenza in returning febrile travellers. The early clinical features may be dismissed easily as 'the flu' resulting in delayed treatment. Treatment options are limited. Oral oseltamivir alone has been the most commonly used drug but mortality remains substantial, up to 80% in Indonesia. Intravenous peramivir has been filed for registration and IV zanamivir is being developed. This review will focus on the epidemiological and clinical features of influenza A/H5N1 avian influenza and will highlight aspects relevant to travel medicine doctors.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a clinical and epidemiological review of avian influenza focusing on disease features and treatment options, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Large-scale evolutionary surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus using resequencing arrays.
Abstract: In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus emerged that rapidly spread around the world. While current variants of this virus have caused widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable groups, there remains the possibility that future variants may cause increased virulence, drug resistance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient large-scale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a resequencing array tool for surveillance of H1N1 virus variants but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Avian influenza virus monitoring in wintering waterbirds in Iran, 2003-2007.
Abstract: Virological, molecular and serological studies were carried out to determine the status of infections with avian influenza viruses (AIV) in different species of wild waterbirds in Iran during 2003-2007. Samples were collected from 1146 birds representing 45 different species with the majority of samples originating from ducks, coots and shorebirds. Samples originated from 6 different provinces representative for the 15 most important wintering sites of migratory waterbirds in Iran. Overall, AIV were detected in approximately 3.4% of the samples. However, prevalence was higher (up to 8.3%) at selected locations and for certain species. No highly pathogenic avian influenza, including H5N1 was detected. A total of 35 AIVs were detected from cloacal or oropharyngeal swab samples. These positive samples originated mainly from Mallards and Common Teals.Of 711 serum samples tested for AIV antibodies, 345 (48.5%) were positive by using a nucleoprotein-specific competitive ELISA (NP-C-ELISA). Ducks including Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler and Eurasian Wigeon revealed the highest antibody prevalence ranging from 44 to 75%. Results of these investigations provide important information about the prevalence of LPAIV in wild birds in Iran, especially wetlands around the Caspian Sea which represent an important wintering site for migratory water birds. Mallard and Common Teal exhibited the highest number of positives in virological and serological investigations: 43% and 26% virological positive cases and 24% and 46% serological positive reactions, respectively. These two species may play an important role in the ecology and perpetuation of influenza viruses in this region. In addition, it could be shown that both oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of positive birds, and neither should be neglected.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an ecological surveillance study of avian influenza virus prevalence in wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Research paths to successful prevention and treatment of swine-derived H1N1 influenza virus infection.
Abstract: Despite the fact that the threat of a new influenza pandemic has been hovering over us for quite some time, the truth is that the weapons currently licensed for fighting the swine-derived H1N1 virus are not quite up to the current needs. Although considerable effort has been put into developing new vaccines and antivirals, the available agents are basically the same ones as 10 years ago. In this review, we consider novel prophylactic and therapeutic alternatives, which luckily are being proposed by experts in the field. The better understanding and basic knowledge of influenza viruses, including their high variability and potential for antigenic drift, has prompted the development of new antivirals and more efficacious vaccines that hold promise for the near future.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis of the surface proteins of influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated in Asian and African populations.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can infect a variety of animals and continually poses a threat to animal and human health. Here, phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes indicated that the hemagglutinin gene of all human isolates, although very similar to each other, fell within different clades corresponding to antigenically distinguishable variants. Likewise, the N1 neuraminidase gene forms a clade that is evolutionarily distinct from previously characterized N1 neuraminidases. So, although all H5N1 viruses were derived from ancestors circulating in south-east Asia more than ten years ago, since 2003 they have evolved into geographically distinct groups within each country.

Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis of viral surface protein genes and geographic evolution, but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States, August 30, 2009-January 9, 2010.
Abstract: The emergence and spread of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (2009 H1N1) resulted in extraordinary influenza activity in the United States throughout the summer and fall months of 2009. During this period, influenza activity reached its highest level in the week ending October 24, 2009, with 49 of 50 states reporting geographically widespread disease. As of January 9, 2010, overall influenza activity had declined substantially. Since April 2009, the dominant circulating influenza virus in the United States has been 2009 H1N1. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from August 30, 2009, through January 9, 2010.

Title: Spatiotemporal structure of molecular evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in Vietnam.
Abstract: Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. First identified in Vietnam in poultry in 2001 and in humans in 2004, the virus has since caused 111 cases and 56 deaths in humans. In 2003/2004 H5N1 outbreaks, nearly the entire poultry population of Vietnam was culled. Our earlier study (Wan et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(10): e3462) demonstrated that there have been at least six independent H5N1 introductions into Vietnam and there were nine newly emerged reassortants from 2001 to 2007 in Vietnam. H5N1 viruses in Vietnam cluster distinctly around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. However, the nature of the relationship between genetic divergence and geographic patterns is still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that genetic distances between H5N1 viruses in Vietnam are correlated with geographic distances, as the result of distinct population and environment patterns along Vietnam's long north to south longitudinal extent. Based on this hypothesis, we combined spatial statistical methods with genetic analytic techniques and explicitly used geographic space to explore genetic evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses at the sub-national scale in Vietnam. Our dataset consisted of 125 influenza viruses (with whole genome sets) isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007. Our results document the significant effect of space and time on genetic evolution and the rise of two regional centers of genetic mixing by 2007. These findings give insight into processes underlying viral evolution and suggest that genetic differentiation is associated with the distance between concentrations of human and poultry populations around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The results show that genetic evolution of H5N1 viruses in Vietnamese domestic poultry is highly correlated with the location and spread of those viruses in geographic space. This correlation varies by scale, time, and gene, though a classic isolation by distance pattern is observed. This study is the first to characterize the geographic structure of influenza viral evolution at the sub-national scale in Vietnam and can shed light on how H5N1 HPAIVs evolve in certain geographic settings.

Title: Evolutionary dynamics of multiple sublineages of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria from 2006 to 2008.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic A/H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) viruses have seriously affected the Nigerian poultry industry since early 2006. Previous studies have identified multiple introductions of the virus into Nigeria and several reassortment events between cocirculating lineages. To determine the spatial, evolutionary, and population dynamics of the multiple H5N1 lineages cocirculating in Nigeria, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 106 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2008 and representing all 25 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) reporting outbreaks. We identified a major new subclade in Nigeria that is phylogenetically distinguishable from all previously identified sublineages, as well as two novel reassortment events. A detailed analysis of viral phylogeography identified two major source populations for the HPAI H5N1 virus in Nigeria, one in a major commercial poultry area (southwest region) and one in northern Nigeria, where contact between wild birds and backyard poultry is frequent. These findings suggested that migratory birds from Eastern Europe or Russia may serve an important role in the introduction of HPAI H5N1 viruses into Nigeria, although virus spread through the movement of poultry and poultry products cannot be excluded. Our study provides new insight into the genesis and evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria and has important implications for targeting surveillance efforts to rapidly identify the spread of the virus into and within Nigeria.

Title: Theoretical aspects of immunity.
Abstract: The immune system recognizes a myriad of invading pathogens and their toxic products. It does so with a finite repertoire of antibodies and T cell receptors. We here describe theories that quantify the dynamics of the immune system. We describe how the immune system recognizes antigens by searching the large space of receptor molecules. We consider in some detail the theories that quantify the immune response to influenza and dengue fever. We review theoretical descriptions of the complementary evolution of pathogens that occurs in response to immune system pressure. Methods including bioinformatics, molecular simulation, random energy models, and quantum field theory contribute to a theoretical understanding of aspects of immunity.

Title: Hitchhiking and the population genetic structure of avian influenza virus.
Abstract: Previous studies have revealed a major difference in the phylogenetic structure, extent of genetic diversity, and selection pressure between the surface glycoproteins and internal gene segments of avian influenza viruses (AIV) sampled from wild birds. However, what evolutionary processes are responsible for these strikingly different evolutionary patterns is unclear. To address this issue, we estimated the rate of evolutionary change and time of origin of each segment of AIV sampled globally. Strikingly, the internal segments of the sampled AIV strains possess common ancestors that existed less than 200 years ago. Similarly recent times of origin were observed for each of the individual subtypes within the HA, NA, and NS gene segments. Such a shallow history of genetic diversity suggests an evolutionary model in which the genetic structure of AIV is shaped by a combination of occasional selective sweeps in the HA and NA (and possibly NS) segments, coupled with transient genetic linkage to the internal gene segments.

Title: Development of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of avian influenza viruses in field specimens.
Abstract: Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an established gene amplification method for rapid diagnosis of various infectious diseases. In order to detect avian influenza viruses, particularly in field specimens, specific primers targeting the matrix gene were designed. Thirty-four virus samples, including isolates from wild and domestic avian hosts belonging to various geographical areas, were used to confirm the validity of the primers. All samples were confirmed to be positive in less than 1 hr. The RT-LAMP assay was also able to detect avian influenza virus in the various field samples, such as swabs, tissues, and feces. These results indicate that the developed RT-LAMP assay with uniquely designed primers is potentially useful in comprehensive avian influenza surveillance.

Title: Aurintricarboxylic acid is a potent inhibitor of influenza A and B virus neuraminidases.
Abstract: Influenza viruses cause serious infections that can be prevented or treated using vaccines or antiviral agents, respectively. While vaccines are effective, they have a number of limitations, and influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. This necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. We investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. We found, by neutral red assay, that ATA was protective, and by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, confirmed that ATA reduced viral replication and release. Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride.

Title: Post-exposure prophylaxis during pandemic outbreaks.
Abstract: With the rise of the second pandemic wave of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in the current season in the Northern Hemisphere, pandemic plans are being carefully re-evaluated, particularly for the strategic use of antiviral drugs. The recent emergence of oseltamivir-resistant in treated H1N1 patients has raised concerns about the prudent use of neuraminidase inhibitors for both treatment of ill individuals and post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts. We extended an established population dynamical model of pandemic influenza with treatment to include post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts. Using parameter estimates published in the literature, we simulated the model to evaluate the combined effect of treatment and prophylaxis in minimizing morbidity and mortality of pandemic infections in the context of transmissible drug resistance. We demonstrated that, when transmissible resistant strains are present, post-exposure prophylaxis can promote the spread of resistance, especially when combined with aggressive treatment. For a given treatment level, there is an optimal coverage of prophylaxis that minimizes the total number of infections (final size) and this coverage decreases as a higher proportion of infected individuals are treated. We found that, when treatment is maintained at intermediate levels, limited post-exposure prophylaxis provides an optimal strategy for reducing the final size of the pandemic while minimizing the total number of deaths. We tested our results by performing a sensitivity analysis over a range of key model parameters and observed that the incidence of infection depends strongly on the transmission fitness of resistant strains. Our findings suggest that, in the presence of transmissible drug resistance, strategies that prioritize the treatment of only ill individuals, rather than the prophylaxis of those suspected of being exposed, are most effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic. The impact of post-exposure prophylaxis depends critically on the treatment level and the transmissibility of resistant strains and, therefore, enhanced surveillance and clinical monitoring for resistant mutants constitutes a key component of any comprehensive plan for antiviral drug use during an influenza pandemic.

Reason: This is a modeling study of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis strategies; it does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses detected in Europe during season 2007-8 had epidemiologic and clinical characteristics similar to co-circulating susceptible A(H1N1) viruses.
Abstract: During the 2007-08 influenza season, high levels of oseltamivir resistance were detected among influenza A(H1N1) viruses ina number of European countries. We used surveillance data to describe influenza A(H1N1) cases for whom antiviral resistance testing was performed. We pooled data from national studies to identify possible risk factors for infection with a resistant virus and to ascertain whether such infections led to influenza illness of different severity. Information on demographic and clinical variables was obtained from patients or their physicians. Odds ratios for infection with an oseltamivir resistant virus and relative risks for developing certain clinical outcomes were computed and adjusted through multivariable analysis. Overall, 727 (24.3%) of 2,992 tested influenza A(H1N1) viruses from 22 of 30 European countries were oseltamivir-resistant. Levels of resistance ranged from 1% in Italy to 67% in Norway. Five countries provided detailed case-based data on 373 oseltamivir resistant and 796 susceptible cases. By multivariable analysis, none of the analysed factors was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection with anoseltamivir-resistant virus. Similarly, infection with an oseltamivir-resistant virus was not significantly associated with a different risk of pneumonia, hospitalisation or any clinical complication. The large-scale emergence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses in Europe calls for a review of guidelines for influenza treatment.

Title: [Highly pathogenic avian influenza and wild birds].
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 prevails worldwide and causes serious problems in poultry industry. The virus is also known as one of the most important zoonotic agents derived from avian species. Because many bird species other than poultry such as chicken and duck are susceptible for HPAIV infection, wild birds are thought to play an important role in distribution and transmission of the virus. However, the ecological role of wild birds as a reservoir of HPAIV in nature has not been completely understood. To define the ecological role of wild birds in distribution of HPAIV, extensive surveillance in wild birds including migratory and resident birds in Japan was conducted. Until now, 3 strains of H5N1 subtype have been isolated. One was isolated from mountain hawk-eagle (Spizaetus nipalensis) which was found sick at Sagara village, Kumamoto prefecture, Japan on January 2007 and ultimately died after a short while. The other two strains were isolated from whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) which were found at Lake Towada in Aomori prefecture in April and May 2008, respectively. Because the wild birds migrate on a global scale, similar problems could be always happened in any other countries. Consequently, comprehensive surveillance in wild birds with international cooperation is required for efficient global control of HPAI.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a surveillance and ecological study of HPAI in wild birds without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolutionary fingerprinting of genes.
Abstract: Over time, natural selection molds every gene into a unique mosaic of sites evolving rapidly or resisting change-an "evolutionary fingerprint" of the gene. Aspects of this evolutionary fingerprint, such as the site-specific ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS), are commonly used to identify genetic features of potential biological interest; however, no framework exists for comparing evolutionary fingerprints between genes. We hypothesize that protein-coding genes with similar protein structure and/or function tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints and that comparing evolutionary fingerprints can be useful for discovering similarities between genes in a way that is analogous to, but independent of, discovery of similarity via sequence-based comparison tools such as Blast. To test this hypothesis, we develop a novel model of coding sequence evolution that uses a general bivariate discrete parameterization of the evolutionary rates. We show that this approach provides a better fit to the data using a smaller number of parameters than existing models. Next, we use the model to represent evolutionary fingerprints as probability distributions and present a methodology for comparing these distributions in a way that is robust against variations in data set size and divergence. Finally, using sequences of three rapidly evolving RNA viruses (HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A virus), we demonstrate that genes within the same functional group tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints. Our framework provides a sound statistical foundation for efficient inference and comparison of evolutionary rate patterns in arbitrary collections of gene alignments, clustering homologous and nonhomologous genes, and investigation of biological and functional correlates of evolutionary rates.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a methodological paper on evolutionary fingerprinting of genes without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: The comparative genomics of viral emergence.
Abstract: RNA viruses are the main agents of emerging and re-emerging diseases. It is therefore important to reveal the evolutionary processes that underpin their ability to jump species boundaries and establish themselves in new hosts. Here, I discuss how comparative genomics can contribute to this endeavor. Arguably the most important evolutionary process in RNA virus evolution, abundant mutation, may even open up avenues for their control through "lethal mutagenesis." Despite this remarkable mutational power, adaptation to diverse host species remains a major adaptive challenge, such that the most common outcome of host jumps are short-term "spillover" infections. A powerful case study of the utility of genomic approaches to studies of viral evolution and emergence is provided by influenza virus and brought into sharp focus by the ongoing epidemic of swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus (A/H1N1pdm). Research here reveals a marked lack of surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs, coupled with the possibility of cryptic transmission before the first reported human cases, such that the exact genesis of A/H1N1pdm (where, when, how) is uncertain.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing comparative genomics and viral emergence without explicit genotype-phenotype experimental links.

Title: The role of genomics in tracking the evolution of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of short-term respiratory infections associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The pandemics occur when new human-transmissible viruses that have the major surface protein of influenza A viruses from other host species are introduced into the human population. Between such rare events, the evolution of influenza is shaped by antigenic drift: the accumulation of mutations that result in changes in exposed regions of the viral surface proteins. Antigenic drift makes the virus less susceptible to immediate neutralization by the immune system in individuals who have had a previous influenza infection or vaccination. A biannual reevaluation of the vaccine composition is essential to maintain its effectiveness due to this immune escape. The study of influenza genomes is key to this endeavor, increasing our understanding of antigenic drift and enhancing the accuracy of vaccine strain selection. Recent large-scale genome sequencing and antigenic typing has considerably improved our understanding of influenza evolution: epidemics around the globe are seeded from a reservoir in East-Southeast Asia with year-round prevalence of influenza viruses; antigenically similar strains predominate in epidemics worldwide for several years before being replaced by a new antigenic cluster of strains. Future in-depth studies of the influenza reservoir, along with large-scale data mining of genomic resources and the integration of epidemiological, genomic, and antigenic data, should enhance our understanding of antigenic drift and improve the detection and control of antigenically novel emerging strains.

Reason: This is a review on the role of genomics in influenza evolution and vaccine strain selection without direct experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza A gradual and epochal evolution: insights from simple models.
Abstract: The recurrence of influenza A epidemics has originally been explained by a "continuous antigenic drift" scenario. Recently, it has been shown that if genetic drift is gradual, the evolution of influenza A main antigen, the haemagglutinin, is punctuated. As a consequence, it has been suggested that influenza A dynamics at the population level should be approximated by a serial model. Here, simple models are used to test whether a serial model requires gradual antigenic drift within groups of strains with the same antigenic properties (antigenic clusters). We compare the effect of status based and history based frameworks and the influence of reduced susceptibility and infectivity assumptions on the transient dynamics of antigenic clusters. Our results reveal that the replacement of a resident antigenic cluster by a mutant cluster, as observed in data, is reproduced only by the status based model integrating the reduced infectivity assumption. This combination of assumptions is useful to overcome the otherwise extremely high model dimensionality of models incorporating many strains, but relies on a biological hypothesis not obviously satisfied. Our findings finally suggest the dynamical importance of gradual antigenic drift even in the presence of punctuated immune escape. A more regular renewal of susceptible pool than the one implemented in a serial model should be part of a minimal theory for influenza at the population level.
Relevant: False
Reason: This modeling study focuses on influenza antigenic evolution dynamics without direct experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Viral aggregating and opsonizing activity in collectin trimers.
Abstract: Collectins are collagenous lectins present in blood, respiratory lining fluid, and other mucosal secretions that play important roles in innate defense against infection. The collectin, surfactant protein D (SP-D), limits infection by viruses and bacteria in the respiratory tract, eye, and female genital tract. Multimeric SP-D has strong antiviral activity and is a potent viral and bacterial agglutinin and opsonin; however, trimers composed of the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain (hSP-D-NCRD) of SP-D lack these activities. We now show that, in contrast, a trimeric neck and CRD construct of bovine serum collectin CL-46 induces aggregation of influenza A virus (IAV) and potently increases IAV uptake by neutrophils. CL-46-NCRD showed calcium-dependent and sugar-sensitive binding to both neutrophils and IAV. Replacement of specific residues of the CRD of human SP-D with those found in bovine serum collectins conferred opsonizing activity. The most effective substitution involved replacement of arginine 343 with valine (hSP-D-NCRD/R343V). hSP-D-NCRD/R343V greatly increased viral uptake by neutrophils and monocytes and also potentiated neutrophil respiratory burst responses. These effects were further increased by cross-linking of hSP-D-NCRD/R343V trimers with MAbs directed against areas of the hSP-D-NCRD not involved in viral binding. Unlike the wild-type human SP-D hSP-D-NCRD, hSP-D-NCRD/R343V also induced viral aggregation. These results indicate that collectins can act as opsonins for IAV even in the absence of the collagen domain or higher order multimerization. This may involve increased affinity of individual CRDs for glycoconjugates displayed on host cells or the viral envelope.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on collectin proteins' interaction with influenza virus and their opsonizing activity, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Changes in prescribing of antiviral medications for influenza associated with new treatment guidelines.
Abstract: In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended discontinuing the use of adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) to treat influenza because of high levels of resistance to this class of antivirals. We examined changes in prescribing practices resulting from this recommendation and found that prescribing of adamantanes declined nationwide, with these drugs accounting for approximately 40% of the antivirals prescribed for influenza from 2000 to 2005 and only 2% in 2006. This finding provides evidence of a rapid change in clinical practice associated with the dissemination of treatment guidelines. Evaluating the effectiveness with which public health recommendations are translated into practice is important given the ongoing emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs and a novel H1N1 influenza virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an epidemiological study on prescribing practices and antiviral resistance trends, without direct genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: Bayesian phylogeography finds its roots.
Abstract: As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.

Title: RNA virus genomics: a world of possibilities.
Abstract: The increasing availability of complete genome sequences of RNA viruses has the potential to shed new light on fundamental aspects of their biology. Here, I use case studies of 3 RNA viruses to explore the impact of genomic sequence data, with particular emphasis on influenza A virus. Notably, the studies of RNA virus genomics undertaken to date largely focused on issues of evolution and epidemiology, and they have given these disciplines new impetus. However, genomic data have so far made fewer inroads into areas of more direct importance for disease, prevention, and control; thus, harnessing their full potential remains an important goal.

Title: Influenza in long-term care facilities: preventable, detectable, treatable.
Abstract: Influenza in long-term care facilities is an ever more challenging problem. Vaccination of residents and health care workers is the most important preventive measure. Although vaccine efficacy has been questioned, the preponderance of data favors vaccination. Antiviral resistance complicates postexposure chemoprophylaxis and treatment. Factors that limit the choice of antiviral agents in this patient population include limited vaccine supplies and impaired dexterity and confusion in long-term care residents.

Title: Context-specific target definition in influenza a virus hemagglutinin-glycan receptor interactions.
Abstract: Protein-glycan interactions are important regulators of a variety of biological processes, ranging from immune recognition to anticoagulation. An important area of active research is directed toward understanding the role of host cell surface glycans as recognition sites for pathogen protein receptors. Recognition of cell surface glycans is a widely employed strategy for a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses. We present here a representative example of such an interaction: the binding of influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) to specific sialylated glycans on the cell surface of human upper airway epithelial cells, which initiates the infection cycle. We detail a generalizable strategy to understand the nature of protein-glycan interactions both structurally and biochemically, using HA as a model system. This strategy combines a top-down approach using available structural information to define important contacts between glycans and HA, with a bottom-up approach using data-mining and informatics approaches to identify the common motifs that distinguish glycan binders from nonbinders. By probing protein-glycan interactions simultaneously through top-down and bottom-up approaches, we can scientifically validate a series of observations. This in turn provides additional confidence and surmounts known challenges in the study of protein-glycan interactions, such as accounting for multivalency, and thus truly defines concepts such as specificity, affinity, and avidity. With the advent of new technologies for glycomics-including glycan arrays, data-mining solutions, and robust algorithms to model protein-glycan interactions-we anticipate that such combination approaches will become tractable for a wide variety of protein-glycan interactions.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on protein-glycan interactions and structural/biochemical analysis of hemagglutinin binding, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evolution and emergence of novel human infections.
Abstract: Some zoonotic pathogens cause sporadic infection in humans but rarely propagate further, while others have succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and becoming established in the human population. Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability. Finally, we present a simple method for monitoring outbreaks for signs of emergence and discuss public health implications.
Relevant: False

Title: Characterization of H3N6 avian influenza virus isolated from a wild white pelican in Zambia.
Abstract: We characterized an influenza virus isolated from a great white pelican in Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of its gene segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage and that they appear to have evolved in distinct geographical regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, suggesting reassortment of virus genes maintained in wild aquatic birds whose flyways overlap across these continents. It is notable that this virus might possess some genes of the same origin as those of highly pathogenic H7 and H5 viruses isolated in Eurasia. The present study underscores the need for continued monitoring of avian influenza viruses in Eurasia and Africa.

Title: Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2009.
Abstract: This report updates the 2008 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccine for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza (CDC. Prevention and control of influenza: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2008;57[No. RR-7]). Information on vaccination issues related to the recently identified novel influenza A H1N1 virus will be published later in 2009. The 2009 seasonal influenza recommendations include new and updated information. Highlights of the 2009 recommendations include 1) a recommendation that annual vaccination be administered to all children aged 6 months-18 years for the 2009-10 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that vaccines containing the 2009-10 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens be used; and 3) a notice that recommendations for influenza diagnosis and antiviral use will be published before the start of the 2009-10 influenza season. Vaccination efforts should begin as soon as vaccine is available and continue through the influenza season. Approximately 83% of the United States population is specifically recommended for annual vaccination against seasonal influenza; however, <40% of the U.S. population received the 2008-09 influenza vaccine. These recommendations also include a summary of safety data for U.S. licensed influenza vaccines. These recommendations and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu); any updates or supplements that might be required during the 2009-10 influenza season also can be found at this website. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announcements of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information.

Title: Structure and function of the influenza A M2 proton channel.
Abstract: The M2 protein of influenza A viruses forms a tetrameric pH-activated proton-selective channel that is targeted by the amantadine class of antiviral drugs. Its ion channel function has been extensively studied by electrophysiology and mutagenesis; however, the molecular mechanism of proton transport is still elusive, and the mechanism of inhibition by amantadine is controversial. We review the functional data on proton channel activity, molecular dynamics simulations of the proton conduction mechanism, and high-resolution structural and dynamical information of this membrane protein in lipid bilayers and lipid-mimetic detergents. These studies indicate that elucidation of the structural basis of M2 channel activity and inhibition requires thorough examination of the complex dynamics and conformational plasticity of the protein in different lipid bilayers and lipid-mimetic environments.

Title: What is the optimal therapy for patients with H5N1 influenza?
Abstract: In a 2007 article in PLoS Medicine[10], Holger J. Schünemann and colleagues described a new process used by the World Health Organization for rapidly developing clinical management guidelines in emergency situations. These situations include outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. The authors discussed how they developed such a "rapid advice" guideline for the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The guideline recommends giving the antiviral drug oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg twice daily for five days. In this Debate, Nicholas White argues that such dosing is inadequate, Robert Webster and Elena Govorkova say that combination antiviral therapy should be used, and Tim Uyeki reminds us that clinical care of patients with H5N1 entails much more than antiviral treatment. These issues may also apply to therapy of patients hospitalized with severe disease due to novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.

Title: Understanding the dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens through modeling the tempo of antigenic change: influenza as a case study.
Abstract: Rapidly evolving pathogens present a major conceptual and mathematical challenge to our understanding of disease dynamics. For these pathogens, the simulation of disease dynamics requires the use of computational models that incorporate pathogen evolution. Currently, these models are limited by two factors. First, their computational complexity hinders their numerical analysis and the ease with which parameters can be statistically estimated. Second, their formulations are frequently not sufficiently general to allow for alternative immunological hypotheses to be considered. Here, we introduce a new modeling framework for rapidly evolving pathogens that lessens both of these limitations. At its core, the proposed framework differs from previous multi-strain models by modeling the tempo of antigenic change instead of the pathogen's genetic change. This shift in focus results in a new model of reduced computational complexity that can accommodate different immunological hypotheses. We demonstrate the utility of this antigenic tempo model in an application to influenza. We show that, under different parameterizations, the model can reproduce the qualitative findings of a diverse set of previously published flu models, despite being less computationally intensive. These advantages of the antigenic tempo model make it a useful alternative to address several outstanding questions for rapidly evolving pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on modeling antigenic change tempo rather than directly linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic characterization of H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated in Indonesia from 2003-2007.
Abstract: The wide distribution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is a global threat to human health. Indonesia has had the largest number of human infections and fatalities caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic conditions of the viruses in Indonesia, twenty-four H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry from 2003 to 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous studies exclusively classified the Indonesian viruses into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, our phylogenetic analyses showed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of the present clades. In addition, novel reassortant viruses were identified that emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in 2005-2006 on Java Island. H5N1 viruses were introduced from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Sumatra Island on multiple occasions from 2003-2007, causing the geographical expansion of these viruses in Indonesia. These findings identify Java Island as the epicenter of the Indonesian H5N1 virus expansion.

Title: Hedging against antiviral resistance during the next influenza pandemic using small stockpiles of an alternative chemotherapy.
Abstract: The effectiveness of single-drug antiviral interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality during the next influenza pandemic will be substantially weakened if transmissible strains emerge which are resistant to the stockpiled antiviral drugs. We developed a mathematical model to test the hypothesis that a small stockpile of a secondary antiviral drug could be used to mitigate the adverse consequences of the emergence of resistant strains. We used a multistrain stochastic transmission model of influenza to show that the spread of antiviral resistance can be significantly reduced by deploying a small stockpile (1% population coverage) of a secondary drug during the early phase of local epidemics. We considered two strategies for the use of the secondary stockpile: early combination chemotherapy (ECC; individuals are treated with both drugs in combination while both are available); and sequential multidrug chemotherapy (SMC; individuals are treated only with the secondary drug until it is exhausted, then treated with the primary drug). We investigated all potentially important regions of unknown parameter space and found that both ECC and SMC reduced the cumulative attack rate (AR) and the resistant attack rate (RAR) unless the probability of emergence of resistance to the primary drug p(A) was so low (less than 1 in 10,000) that resistance was unlikely to be a problem or so high (more than 1 in 20) that resistance emerged as soon as primary drug monotherapy began. For example, when the basic reproductive number was 1.8 and 40% of symptomatic individuals were treated with antivirals, AR and RAR were 67% and 38% under monotherapy if p(A) = 0.01. If the probability of resistance emergence for the secondary drug was also 0.01, then SMC reduced AR and RAR to 57% and 2%. The effectiveness of ECC was similar if combination chemotherapy reduced the probabilities of resistance emergence by at least ten times. We extended our model using travel data between 105 large cities to investigate the robustness of these resistance-limiting strategies at a global scale. We found that as long as populations that were the main source of resistant strains employed these strategies (SMC or ECC), then those same strategies were also effective for populations far from the source even when some intermediate populations failed to control resistance. In essence, through the existence of many wild-type epidemics, the interconnectedness of the global network dampened the international spread of resistant strains. Our results indicate that the augmentation of existing stockpiles of a single anti-influenza drug with smaller stockpiles of a second drug could be an effective and inexpensive epidemiological hedge against antiviral resistance if either SMC or ECC were used. Choosing between these strategies will require additional empirical studies. Specifically, the choice will depend on the safety of combination therapy and the synergistic effect of one antiviral in suppressing the emergence of resistance to the other antiviral when both are taken in combination.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study of antiviral resistance dynamics and strategies, without direct genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Sales of oseltamivir in Norway prior to the emergence of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses in 2007-08.
Abstract: An unprecedented high proportion of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses emerged in the 2007-08 influenza season. In Norway, two thirds of all tested A(H1N1) viruses were resistant to the antiviral drug. In order to see if this emergence could be explained by a drug induced selection pressure, we analysed data on the sales of oseltamivir in Norway for the years 2002-07. We used data from two sources; the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics Database and the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD), for the years 2002-2007. We calculated courses sold of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) per 1000 inhabitants per year. Our data showed that, except for the years 2005 and 2006, sales of oseltamivir were low in Norway; courses sold per 1000 inhabitants varied between 0.17-1.64. The higher sales in 2005 and 2006 we believe were caused by private stockpiling in fear of a pandemic, and do not represent actual usage. A drug induced selection pressure was probably not the cause of the emergence of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses in 2007-08 in Norway.

Title: Update: swine influenza A (H1N1) infections--California and Texas, April 2009.
Abstract: On April 21, 2009, CDC reported that two recent cases of febrile respiratory illness in children in southern California had been caused by infection with genetically similar swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses. The viruses contained a unique combination of gene segments that had not been reported previously among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Neither child had known contact with pigs, resulting in concern that human-to-human transmission might have occurred. The seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 strain is thought to be unlikely to provide protection. This report updates the status of the ongoing investigation and provides preliminary details about six additional persons infected by the same strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus identified in the previous cases, as of April 24. The six additional cases were reported in San Diego County, California (three cases), Imperial County, California (one case), and Guadalupe County, Texas (two cases). CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services are conducting case investigations, monitoring for illness in contacts of the eight patients, and enhancing surveillance to determine the extent of spread of the virus. CDC continues to recommend that any influenza A viruses that cannot be subtyped be sent promptly for testing to CDC. In addition, swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses of the same strain as those in the U.S. patients have been confirmed by CDC among specimens from patients in Mexico. Clinicians should consider swine influenza as well as seasonal influenza virus infections in the differential diagnosis for patients who have febrile respiratory illness and who 1) live in San Diego and Imperial counties, California, or Guadalupe County, Texas, or traveled to these counties or 2) who traveled recently to Mexico or were in contact with persons who had febrile respiratory illness and were in one of the three U.S. counties or Mexico during the 7 days preceding their illness onset.

Title: Update: drug susceptibility of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) viruses, April 2009.
Abstract: Since April 21, 2009, CDC has reported cases of respiratory infection with a swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) that is being spread via human-to-human transmission. As of April 28, the total number of confirmed S-OIV cases in the United States was 64; these cases occurred in California (10 cases), Kansas (two), New York (45), Ohio (one), and Texas (six). The viruses contain a unique combination of gene segments that had not been reported previously among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Viruses from 13 (20%) of 64 patients have been tested for resistance to antiviral medications. To date, all tested viruses are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. The purpose of this report is to provide detailed information on the drug susceptibility of the newly detected S-OIVs, which will aid in making recommendations for treatment and prophylaxis for swine influenza A (H1N1) infection. These data also will contribute to antiviral-resistance monitoring and diagnostic test development.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States, September 28, 2008-April 4, 2009, and composition of the 2009-10 influenza vaccine.
Abstract: This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity from September 28, 2008, the start of the 2008-09 influenza season, through April 4, 2009, and reports on the 2009-10 influenza vaccine strain selection. Low levels of influenza activity were reported from October through early January. Activity increased from mid-January and peaked in mid-February. Influenza A (H1N1) viruses have predominated overall this season, but influenza B viruses have been isolated more frequently than influenza A viruses since mid-March. Widespread oseltamivir resistance was detected among circulating influenza A (H1N1) viruses and a high level of adamantane resistance was identified among influenza A (H3N2) viruses.

Title: Influenza virus resistance to antiviral agents: a plea for rational use.
Abstract: Although influenza vaccine can prevent influenza virus infection, the only therapeutic options to treat influenza virus infection are antiviral agents. At the current time, nearly all influenza A/H3N2 viruses and a percentage of influenza A/H1N1 viruses are adamantane resistant, which leaves only neuraminidase inhibitors available for treatment of infection with these viruses. In December 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data demonstrating that a high percentage of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses are now resistant to oseltamivir. In addition, oseltamivir-resistant influenza B and A/H5N1 viruses have been identified. Thus, use of monotherapy for influenza virus infection is irrational and may contribute to mutational pressure for further selection of antiviral-resistant strains. History has demonstrated that monotherapy for influenza virus infection leads to resistance, resulting in the use of a new monotherapy agent followed by resistance to that new agent and thus resulting in a background of viruses resistant to both drugs. We argue that combination antiviral therapy, new guidelines for indications for treatment, point-of-care diagnostic testing, and a universal influenza vaccination recommendation are critical to protecting the population against influenza virus and to preserving the benefits of antiviral agents.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses antiviral resistance and treatment strategies but does not explicitly link specific viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Incorporation of influenza A virus genome segments does not absolutely require wild-type sequences.
Abstract: The efficient incorporation of influenza virus genome segments into virions is mediated by cis-acting regions at both ends of the viral RNAs. It was shown previously that nt 16-26 at the 3' end of the non-structural (NS) viral RNA of influenza A virus are important for efficient virion incorporation and that nt 27-56 also contribute to this process. To understand further the signalling requirements for genome packaging, this study performed linker-scanning mutagenesis in the latter region and found that nt 27-35 made an appreciable contribution to the efficient incorporation of the NS segment. An NS vRNA library was then generated composed of an RNA population with randomized nucleotides at positions 16-35 such that the virus could select the sequences it required for virion incorporation. The sequences selected differed from the wild-type sequence and no conserved nucleotides were selected. The ability of non-wild-type sequences to function in this manner indicates that the incorporation of influenza A virus genome segments does not absolutely require specific sequences.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the role of specific nucleotide sequences in genome segment incorporation but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Paradox of vaccination: is vaccination really effective against avian flu epidemics?
Abstract: Although vaccination can be a useful tool for control of avian influenza epidemics, it might engender emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain. Field and experimental studies show that some avian influenza strains acquire resistance ability against vaccination. We investigated, in the context of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain, whether a vaccination program can prevent the spread of infectious disease. We also investigated how losses from immunization by vaccination imposed by the resistant strain affect the spread of the disease. We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartment model illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We investigated how the loss of protection effectiveness impacts the program. Results show that a vaccination to prevent the spread of disease can instead spread the disease when the resistant strain is less virulent than the sensitive strain. If the loss is high, the program does not prevent the spread of the resistant strain despite a large prevalence rate of the program. The epidemic's final size can be larger than that before the vaccination program. We propose how to use poor vaccines, which have a large loss, to maximize program effects and describe various program risks, which can be estimated using available epidemiological data. We presented clear and simple concepts to elucidate vaccination program guidelines to avoid negative program effects. Using our theory, monitoring the virulence of the resistant strain and investigating the loss caused by the resistant strain better development of vaccination strategies is possible.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper models epidemiological dynamics of vaccine-sensitive and resistant strains but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: PrimerHunter: a primer design tool for PCR-based virus subtype identification.
Abstract: Rapid and reliable virus subtype identification is critical for accurate diagnosis of human infections, effective response to epidemic outbreaks and global-scale surveillance of highly pathogenic viral subtypes such as avian influenza H5N1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the method of choice for virus subtype identification. However, designing subtype-specific PCR primer pairs is a very challenging task: on one hand, selected primer pairs must result in robust amplification in the presence of a significant degree of sequence heterogeneity within subtypes, on the other, they must discriminate between the subtype of interest and closely related subtypes. In this article, we present a new tool, called PrimerHunter, that can be used to select highly sensitive and specific primers for virus subtyping. Our tool takes as input sets of both target and nontarget sequences. Primers are selected such that they efficiently amplify any one of the target sequences, and none of the nontarget sequences. PrimerHunter ensures the desired amplification properties by using accurate estimates of melting temperature with mismatches, computed based on the nearest neighbor model via an efficient fractional programming algorithm. Validation experiments with three avian influenza HA subtypes confirm that primers selected by PrimerHunter have high sensitivity and specificity for target sequences.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a computational tool for primer design for virus subtype identification and does not discuss genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Use of oseltamivir in 12 European countries between 2002 and 2007--lack of association with the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses.
Abstract: Variable levels of oseltamivir resistance among seasonal influenza A(H1N1) isolates have been reported in Europe during the 2007-8 northern Hemisphere influenza season. It has been questioned whether oseltamivir use could have driven the emergence and predominance of resistant viruses. This study aimed at describing the levels of use of oseltamivir in 12 European Union (EU) Member States and European Economic Area (EEA)/European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries. The data were converted into prescription rates and compared with the national proportions of resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses through regression analysis. Overall use of oseltamivir in European countries between 2002 and 2007 was low compared to e.g. the use in Japan. High variability between the countries and over time was observed. In eight of the 12 countries, there was a peak of prescriptions in 2005, coinciding with concerns about a perceived threat from an influenza pandemic which might have lead to personal stockpiling. Ecological comparison between national levels of use of oseltamivir in 2007 and the proportions of A(H1N1) viruses that were resistant to oseltamivir showed no statistical association. In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that the emergence and persistence of these viruses in 2007-8 was related to the levels of use of oseltamivir in Europe. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the reasons for different level of use between the countries.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study analyzes oseltamivir usage and resistance emergence at the population level without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Update: influenza activity - United States, September 28, 2008--January 31, 2009.
Abstract: From September 28, 2008, to January 31, 2009, influenza activity remained low in the United States but began to increase at the end of January. Thus far during the 2008-09 influenza season, influenza A viruses have predominated and are antigenically related to the 2008-09 influenza vaccine strains. Oseltamivir resistance has been detected in nearly all of the influenza A (H1N1) viruses tested so far during the 2008-09 season, with high levels of adamantane resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews interim recommendations for the use of influenza antiviral medications.

Title: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in frozen duck carcasses, Germany, 2007.
Abstract: We conducted phylogenetic and epidemiologic analyses to determine sources of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), subtype H5N1, in poultry holdings in 2007 in Germany, and a suspected incursion of HPAIV into the food chain through contaminated deep-frozen duck carcasses. In summer 2007, HPAIV (H5N1) outbreaks in 3 poultry holdings in Germany were temporally, spatially, and phylogenetically linked to outbreaks in wild aquatic birds. Detection of HPAIV (H5N1) in frozen duck carcass samples of retained slaughter batches of 1 farm indicated that silent infection had occurred for some time before the incidental detection. Phylogenetic analysis established a direct epidemiologic link between HPAIV isolated from duck meat and strains isolated from 3 further outbreaks in December 2007 in backyard chickens that had access to uncooked offal from commercial deep-frozen duck carcasses. Measures that will prevent such undetected introduction of HPAIV (H5N1) into the food chain are urgently required.

Title: Incorporating demographic stochasticity into multi-strain epidemic models: application to influenza A.
Abstract: We develop mathematical models of the transmission and evolution of multi-strain pathogens that incorporate strain extinction and the stochastic generation of new strains via mutation. The dynamics resulting from these models is then examined with the applied aim of understanding the mechanisms underpinning the evolution and dynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, such as human influenza viruses. Our approach, while analytically relatively simple, gives results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained from much more complex individually based simulation models. We examine strain dynamics as a function of cross-immunity and key transmission parameters, and show that introducing strain extinction and modelling mutation as a stochastic process significantly changes the model dynamics, leading to lower strain diversity, reduced infection prevalence and shorter strain lifetimes. Finally, we incorporate transient strain-transcending immunity in the model and demonstrate that it reduces strain diversity further, giving patterns of sequential strain replacement similar to that seen in human influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops mathematical models of strain dynamics without explicit experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Host adaptation mechanisms of Influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are a member of Orthomyxoviridae possessing negative-sense, single-stranded, and 8 segmented RNA genomes. These 8 RNA segments encode individual specific viral proteins, and up until now a total of 11 proteins have been identified including alternate open reading frame in one genome. Because of this simplicity, utilization of many host systems is required during the viral infection cycle in a cell. Therefore adaptation to the host cell system is the most important issue for the influenza A virus infection and transmission. Although there are many factors which relate to the host adaptation in the viruses themselves, elucidation of mechanisms about changing viral receptor specificities is one of the most advanced research areas. Because the avian type viral receptor was found in the human lungs, the situation, such as co-existence of avian- and human-derived viral receptors in the human airway, may contribute to the human adaptation of avian derived influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses host adaptation mechanisms broadly without explicit experimental genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Characterization of a Canadian mink H3N2 influenza A virus isolate genetically related to triple reassortant swine influenza virus.
Abstract: In 2007, an H3N2 influenza A virus was isolated from Canadian mink. This virus was found to be phylogenetically related to a triple reassortant influenza virus which emerged in Canadian swine in 2005, but it is antigenically distinct. The transmission of the virus from swine to mink seems to have occurred following the feeding of animals with a ration composed of uncooked meat by-products of swine obtained from slaughterhouse facilities. Serological analyses suggest that the mink influenza virus does not circulate in the swine population. Presently, the prevalence of influenza virus in Canadian farmed and wild mink populations is unknown. The natural occurrence of influenza virus infection in mink with the presence of clinical signs is a rare event that deserves to be reported.

Title: Mechanism of NKT cell activation by intranasal coadministration of alpha-galactosylceramide, which can induce cross-protection against influenza viruses.
Abstract: In a nasal vaccine against influenza, the activation of natural killer T (NKT) cells by intranasal coadministration of alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) can potently enhance protective immune responses. The results of this study show that the NKT cell-activated nasal vaccine can induce an effective cross-protection against different strains of influenza virus, including H5 type. To analyze the mechanism of NKT cell activation by this nasal vaccine, we prepared fluorescence-labeled alpha-GalCer by which we detect a direct interaction between NKT cells and alpha-GalCer-stored dendritic cells in nasal mucosa-associated tissues. Accordingly, although very few NKT cells exist at mucosa, the nasal vaccination induced a localized increase in NKT cell population, which is partly dependent on CXCL16/CXCR6. Furthermore, we found that NKT cell activation stimulates mucosal IgA production by a mechanism that is dependent on interleukin (IL)-4 production. These results strengthen the basis of nasal vaccination via NKT cell activation, which can induce immune cross-protection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on NKT cell activation and immune response to influenza vaccination, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Update: influenza activity--United States, September 28-November 29, 2008.
Abstract: During September 28-November 29, 2008, influenza activity remained low in the United States. Of the few influenza viruses characterized thus far this season, most are antigenically related to the strains included in the 2008-09 influenza vaccine. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses have been detected, but currently available data are insufficient to predict their prevalence for the 2008-09 season. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews new influenza vaccine recommendations for the current season.

Title: First case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Spain.
Abstract: The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus has been involved in severe mortality in domestic poultry, and has also been found in different species of wildlife in Europe. The Basque Country avian influenza surveillance program began sample collection and processing the fall of 2005. Here we report the first confirmation of the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 strain in a Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) found dead in a pond near Vitoria in the Basque Country on the North of Spain. Regarding the survey for generic influenza type A virus, we have obtained positive results in about 8% of more that 3500 birds examined. We think that the self-limiting nature of our finding and others proves that certain regions have ecological, geographical and climatological features that make it difficult for the H5N1 virus to spread 1 and cause disease at least in the large scale scenario that has been worrying human and animal health authorities during the last years.

Title: CXCR3-deficiency protects influenza-infected CCR5-deficient mice from mortality.
Abstract: Mice lacking the chemokine receptor CCR5 are susceptible to mortality from a normally non-lethal influenza infection. Here we found that CXCR3-deficiency rescued CCR5-deficient (CCR5(-/-)) mice from influenza-induced mortality. The number of mononuclear phagocytes in the airways was transiently increased in CCR5(-/-) mice but not in CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient mice. Antigen-specific CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient CD8 effector cells were less efficient at entering the airways compared with WT or CCR5(-/-) CD8 effector cells. The decrease in inflammatory cell infiltrates in CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient-infected mice correlated with a decrease in CCL2 and IFN-gamma production in the airways. Finally, CXCR3-CCR5 double-deficient mice that survived the primary viral challenge were protected from a lethal secondary challenge, indicating that T-cell-mediated protective memory was not compromised in mice lacking these chemokine receptors. In conclusion, CXCR3-deficiency attenuated the lethal cellular immune response in CCR5(-/-) influenza-infected mice without hindering viral clearance or long-term immunity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on host immune response and chemokine receptor deficiency effects on influenza infection, not on viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: [Resistance in influenza viruses].
Abstract: Influenza virus infection can be prevented and treated with antiviral drugs. The usage of such drugs in Norway has been infrequent, however, they are an important component in our pandemic preparedness planning, as it will probably be difficult to get access to the appropriate vaccine in time before the pandemic reaches the country. The first generation of influenza drugs acquired resistance to a large degree, in contrast to the modern neuraminidase inhibitors that until recently have had minor problems with resistance. This review is based on research found in relevant published literature, together with experience from a virology reference laboratory and participation in a national and international surveillance including susceptibility testing. While resistance has been a longstanding problem with the use of the "old" influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine, only during the winter 2007/2008 did it become clear, that a certain type of virus acquired widespread resistance against the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. Resistance surveillance is crucial for the correct choice of empiric treatment for influenza infection, and will be one of the most important tasks at the National Influenza Centre in certain phases of a pandemic. The current situation with an increasing resistance problem strengthens the need to conduct continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility, as well as development of new antiviral drugs and treatment regimes.

Title: Antiviral resistance and the control of pandemic influenza: the roles of stochasticity, evolution and model details.
Abstract: Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on modeling antiviral resistance emergence and control strategies without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Vietnam between 2001 and 2007.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused dramatic economic losses to the poultry industry of Vietnam and continue to pose a serious threat to public health. As of June 2008, Vietnam had reported nearly one third of worldwide laboratory confirmed human H5N1 infections. To better understand the emergence, spread and evolution of H5N1 in Vietnam we studied over 300 H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from Vietnam since their first detection in 2001. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that six genetically distinct H5N1 viruses were introduced into Vietnam during the past seven years. The H5N1 lineage that evolved following the introduction in 2003 of the A/duck/Hong Kong/821/2002-like viruses, with clade 1 hemagglutinin (HA), continued to predominate in southern Vietnam as of May 2007. A virus with a clade 2.3.4 HA newly introduced into northern Vietnam in 2007, reassorted with pre-existing clade 1 viruses, resulting in the emergence of novel genotypes with neuraminidase (NA) and/or internal gene segments from clade 1 viruses. A total of nine distinct genotypes have been present in Vietnam since 2001, including five that were circulating in 2007. At least four of these genotypes appear to have originated in Vietnam and represent novel H5N1 viruses not reported elsewhere. Geographic and temporal analyses of H5N1 infection dynamics in poultry suggest that the majority of viruses containing new genes were first detected in northern Vietnam and subsequently spread to southern Vietnam after reassorting with pre-existing local viruses in northern Vietnam. Although the routes of entry and spread of H5N1 in Vietnam remain speculative, enhanced poultry import controls and virologic surveillance efforts may help curb the entry and spread of new HPAI viral genes.

Title: Neuraminidase activity provides a practical read-out for a high throughput influenza antiviral screening assay.
Abstract: The emergence of influenza strains that are resistant to commonly used antivirals has highlighted the need to develop new compounds that target viral gene products or host mechanisms that are essential for effective virus replication. Existing assays to identify potential antiviral compounds often use high throughput screening assays that target specific viral replication steps. To broaden the search for antivirals, cell-based replication assays can be performed, but these are often labor intensive and have limited throughput. We have adapted a traditional virus neutralization assay to develop a practical, cell-based, high throughput screening assay. This assay uses viral neuraminidase (NA) as a read-out to quantify influenza replication, thereby offering an assay that is both rapid and sensitive. In addition to identification of inhibitors that target either viral or host factors, the assay allows simultaneous evaluation of drug toxicity. Antiviral activity was demonstrated for a number of known influenza inhibitors including amantadine that targets the M2 ion channel, zanamivir that targets NA, ribavirin that targets IMP dehydrogenase, and bis-indolyl maleimide that targets protein kinase A/C. Amantadine-resistant strains were identified by comparing IC50 with that of the wild-type virus. Antivirals with specificity for a broad range of targets are easily identified in an accelerated viral inhibition assay that uses NA as a read-out of replication. This assay is suitable for high throughput screening to identify potential antivirals or can be used to identify drug-resistant influenza strains.

Title: Climate change and avian influenza.
Abstract: This paper discusses impacts of climate change on the ecology of avian influenza viruses (AI viruses), which presumably co-evolved with migratory water birds, with virus also persisting outside the host in subarctic water bodies. Climate change would almost certainly alter bird migration, influence the AI virus transmission cycle and directly affect virus survival outside the host. The joint, net effects of these changes are rather unpredictable, but it is likely that AI virus circulation in water bird populations will continue with endless adaptation and evolution. In domestic poultry, too little is known about the direct effect of environmental factors on highly pathogenic avian influenza transmission and persistence to allow inference about the possible effect of climate change. However, possible indirect links through changes in the distribution of duck-crop farming are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses ecological impacts of climate change on avian influenza virus circulation without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Evolutionary dynamics and emergence of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses.
Abstract: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus lineage has undergone extensive genetic reassortment with viruses from different sources to produce numerous H5N1 genotypes, and also developed into multiple genetically distinct sublineages in China. From there, the virus has spread to over 60 countries. The ecological success of this virus in diverse species of both poultry and wild birds with frequent introduction to humans suggests that it is a likely source of the next human pandemic. Therefore, the evolutionary and ecological characteristics of its emergence from wild birds into poultry are of considerable interest. Here, we apply the latest analytical techniques to infer the early evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 virus in the population from which it emerged (wild birds and domestic poultry). By estimating the time of most recent common ancestors of each gene segment, we show that the H5N1 prototype virus was likely introduced from wild birds into poultry as a non-reassortant low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus and was not generated by reassortment in poultry. In contrast, more recent H5N1 genotypes were generated locally in aquatic poultry after the prototype virus (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) introduction occurred, i.e., they were not a result of additional emergence from wild birds. We show that the H5N1 virus was introduced into Indonesia and Vietnam 3-6 months prior to detection of the first outbreaks in those countries. Population dynamics analyses revealed a rapid increase in the genetic diversity of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage viruses from mid-1999 to early 2000. Our results suggest that the transmission of reassortant viruses through the mixed poultry population in farms and markets in China has selected HPAI H5N1 viruses that are well adapted to multiple hosts and reduced the interspecies transmission barrier of those viruses.

Title: Protein kinase C theta regulates stability of the peripheral adhesion ring junction and contributes to the sensitivity of target cell lysis by CTL.
Abstract: Destruction of virus-infected cells by CTL is an extremely sensitive and efficient process. Our previous data suggest that LFA-1-ICAM-1 interactions in the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) of the immunological synapse mediate formation of a tight adhesion junction that might contribute to the sensitivity of target cell lysis by CTL. Herein, we compared more (CD8(+)) and less (CD4(+)) effective CTL to understand the molecular events that promote efficient target cell lysis. We found that abrogation of the pSMAC formation significantly impaired the ability of CD8(+) but not CD4(+) CTL to lyse target cells despite having no effect of the amount of released granules by both CD8(+) and CD4(+) CTL. Consistent with this, CD4(+) CTL break their synapses more often than do CD8(+) CTL, which leads to the escape of the cytolytic molecules from the interface. CD4(+) CTL treatment with a protein kinase Ctheta inhibitor increases synapse stability and sensitivity of specific target cell lysis. Thus, formation of a stable pSMAC, which is partially controlled by protein kinase Ctheta, functions to confine the released lytic molecules at the synaptic interface and to enhance the effectiveness of target cell lysis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates CTL-mediated target cell lysis mechanisms unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Improving the realism of deterministic multi-strain models: implications for modelling influenza A.
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for antigenically variable pathogens remains a challenge, particularly if analytical insight is wanted. In particular, while a variety of relatively complex simulation models have reproduced the evolutionary dynamics of influenza, simpler models have given less satisfying descriptions of the patterns seen in data. Here, we develop a set of relatively simple deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi-strain pathogens which give increased biological realism compared with past work. We allow the intensity of cross-immunity generated against one strain given exposure to a different strain to depend on the extent of genetic difference between the strains. We show that the dynamics of this model are determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function and can include fully symmetric equilibria, self-organized strain structures, regular periodic and chaotic regimes. We then extend the model by incorporating transient strain-transcending immunity that acts as a density-dependent mechanism to lower overall infection prevalence and thus pathogen diversity. We conclude that while some aspects of the evolution of influenza can be captured by deterministic models, overall, the description obtainable using a purely deterministic framework is unsatisfactory, implying that stochasticity of strain generation (via mutation) and extinction needs to be captured to appropriately capture influenza dynamics.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper develops deterministic models of multi-strain pathogen dynamics without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: The development and genetic diversity of H5N1 influenza virus in China, 1996-2006.
Abstract: Since it was first detected in 1996, the Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/GD) H5N1 influenza virus and its reassortants have spread to over 60 countries, with over 20 distinct genetic reassortants previously recognized. However, systematic analysis of their interrelationship and the development of genetic diversity have not been explored. As each of those reassortants was first detected in China, here 318 full-length H5N1 virus genomes isolated from 1996 to 2006 in this region were phylogenetically analyzed. Our findings revealed two major group reassortment events in 2001 and 2002 that were responsible for the generation of the majority of the 44 distinct Gs/GD genotypes identified, excepting those 1997 variants. Genotype replacement and emergence occurred continually, with 34 transient genotypes detected while only 10 variants were persistent. Two major replacements of predominant genotypes were also observed: genotype B replaced by Z in 2002 and then genotype Z replaced by the now predominant genotype V in 2005.

Title: Vaccination and antigenic drift in influenza.
Abstract: The relationship between influenza antigenic drift and vaccination lies at the intersection of evolutionary biology and public health, and it must be viewed and analyzed in both contexts simultaneously. In this paper, 1 review what is known about the effects of antigenic drift on vaccination and the effects of vaccination on antigenic drift, and I suggest some simple ways to detect the presence of antigenic drift in seasonal influenza data. If antigenic drift occurs on the time scale of a single influenza season, it may be associated with the presence of herd immunity at the beginning of the season and may indicate a need to monitor for vaccine updates at the end of the season. The relationship between antigenic drift and vaccination must also be viewed in the context of the global circulation of influenza strains and the seeding of local and regional epidemics. In the data sets I consider--from New Zealand, New York, and France--antigenic drift can be statistically detected during some seasons, and seeding of epidemics appears to be endogenous sometimes and exogenous at other times. Improved detection of short-term antigenic drift and epidemic seeding would significantly benefit influenza monitoring efforts and vaccine selection.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper reviews antigenic drift and vaccination effects without direct experimental genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2007.
Abstract: The year 2007 saw the most severe influenza season since national reporting of influenza began in 2001. Early in the season the National Incident Room was activated to provide effective national surveillance, reporting and management of the 2007 seasonal influenza outbreak. A surveillance team were tasked with establishing enhanced surveillance for the 2007 season and investigating unusual events in this outbreak. Key data required to comprehensively describe the number of cases, morbidity, mortality and virology of the influenza outbreak and the possible sources of these data were identified. In 2007 the number of laboratory-confirmed notifications for influenza was 3.1 times higher than the five-year mean. Forty-four per cent of notifications occurred in Queensland. High notification rates were reflected in an increase in presentations with influenza-like illness to sentinel general practices and Emergency Departments. Notifications and notification rates were highest in the 0-4 and 5-9 years age groups, possibly due to a bias towards testing in these age groups. The clinical morbidity of the infection in terms of complications or most affected groups cannot be determined but anecdotal reports indicate this season may have impacted young adults more than is usual. The available data suggest influenza has caused a significant burden on workplaces and the health care system as indicated by data on absenteeism and presentations for health care. The proportion of H1 strains of influenza circulating varied across Australia but was higher than 2006 in most jurisdictions. In 2007, 1,406 influenza isolates from Australia were antigenically analysed at the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne: 58.7% were A(H3N2), 34.4% were A(H1N1) and 6.9% were influenza B viruses. Antigenic drift away from the vaccine strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005 was observed with the A(H3N2) viruses and was also seen with most of the A(H1N1) viruses when compared with the vaccine strain A/New Caledonia/20/99. The small number of influenza B viruses examined were predominately of the B/Yamagata-lineage. Monitoring influenza through the National Incident Room during the 2007 season offered an excellent opportunity to conduct enhanced surveillance under conditions that were real and potentially serious but not an emergency. It enabled the current state of our surveillance systems to be assessed and opportunities for improvement to be identified.

Title: Toward a unified nomenclature system for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1).
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1) has appeared in >60 countries and continues to evolve and diversify at a concerning rate. Because different names have been used to describe emerging lineages of the virus, this study describes a unified nomenclature system to facilitate discussion and comparison of subtype H5N1 lineages.

Title: Influenza activity--United States and worldwide, 2007-08 season.
Abstract: During the 2007-08 influenza season, influenza activity peaked in mid-February in the United States and was associated with greater mortality and higher rates of hospitalization of children aged 0-4 years, compared with each of the previous three seasons. In the United States, influenza A (H1N1) was the predominant strain early in the season; influenza A (H3N2) viruses increased in circulation in January and predominated overall. While influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B viruses cocirculated worldwide, influenza A (H1N1) viruses were most commonly reported in Canada, Europe, and Africa, and influenza B viruses were predominant in most Asian countries. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide during the 2007-08 influenza season (September 30, 2007-May 17, 2008).

Title: The evolutionary genetics and emergence of avian influenza viruses in wild birds.
Abstract: We surveyed the genetic diversity among avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds, comprising 167 complete viral genomes from 14 bird species sampled in four locations across the United States. These isolates represented 29 type A influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations, with up to 26% of isolates showing evidence of mixed subtype infection. Through a phylogenetic analysis of the largest data set of AIV genomes compiled to date, we were able to document a remarkably high rate of genome reassortment, with no clear pattern of gene segment association and occasional inter-hemisphere gene segment migration and reassortment. From this, we propose that AIV in wild birds forms transient "genome constellations," continually reshuffled by reassortment, in contrast to the spread of a limited number of stable genome constellations that characterizes the evolution of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on genetic diversity and reassortment patterns of avian influenza viruses without explicit links to phenotypic traits.

Title: The evolutionary dynamics of human influenza B virus.
Abstract: Despite their close phylogenetic relationship, type A and B influenza viruses exhibit major epidemiological differences in humans, with the latter both less common and less often associated with severe disease. However, it is unclear what processes determine the evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus, and how influenza viruses A and B interact at the evolutionary scale. To address these questions we inferred the phylogenetic history of human influenza B virus using complete genome sequences for which the date (day) of isolation was available. By comparing the phylogenetic patterns of all eight viral segments we determined the occurrence of segment reassortment over a 30-year sampling period. An analysis of rates of nucleotide substitution and selection pressures revealed sporadic occurrences of adaptive evolution, most notably in the viral hemagglutinin and compatible with the action of antigenic drift, yet lower rates of overall and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution compared to influenza A virus. Overall, these results led us to propose a model in which evolutionary changes within and between the antigenically distinct 'Yam88' and 'Vic87' lineages of influenza B virus are the result of changes in herd immunity, with reassortment continuously generating novel genetic variation. Additionally, we suggest that the interaction with influenza A virus may be central in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus, facilitating the shift of dominance between the Vic87 and the Yam88 lineages.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on evolutionary dynamics and reassortment of influenza B virus without explicit links between specific genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: MDCK-SIAT1 cells show improved isolation rates for recent human influenza viruses compared to conventional MDCK cells.
Abstract: The ability to isolate and propagate influenza virus is an essential tool for the yearly surveillance of circulating virus strains and to ensure accurate clinical diagnosis for appropriate treatment. The suitability of MDCK-SIAT1 cells, engineered to express increased levels of alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, as an alternative to conventional MDCK cells for isolation of circulating influenza virus was assessed. A greater number of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses from stored human clinical specimens collected between 2005 and 2007 were isolated following inoculation in MDCK-SIAT1 cells than in MDCK cells. In addition, a higher titer of virus was recovered following culture in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. All A(H1N1) viruses recovered from MDCK-SIAT1 cells were able to agglutinate both turkey and guinea pig red blood cells (RBC), while half of the A(H3N2) viruses recovered after passage in MDCK-SIAT1 cells lost the ability to agglutinate turkey RBC. Importantly, the HA-1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene was genetically stable after passaging in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, a feature not always seen following MDCK cell or embryonated chicken egg passage of human influenza virus. These data indicate that the MDCK-SIAT1 cell line is superior to conventional MDCK cells for isolation of human influenza virus from clinical specimens and may be used routinely for the isolation and propagation of current human influenza viruses for surveillance, diagnostic, and research purposes.

Title: Molecular characterization of an H1N2 swine influenza virus isolated in Miyazaki, Japan, in 2006.
Abstract: Swine influenza virus (SIV) was isolated from a farm in Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan in July 2006. An isolate was genetically subtyped as H1N2 and was designated A/swine/Miyazaki/1/2006 (H1N2). The nucleotide sequences of all eight viral RNA segments were determined, and then phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method. All segments were shown to be closely related to those of Japanese SIV H1N2 isolates, which have been circulating since the 1980s. The results indicate the persistence of the SIV H1N2 subtype in the Japanese pig population for more than two decades and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance for SIV.

Title: Rapid cloning of high-affinity human monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus.
Abstract: Pre-existing neutralizing antibody provides the first line of defence against pathogens in general. For influenza virus, annual vaccinations are given to maintain protective levels of antibody against the currently circulating strains. Here we report that after booster vaccination there was a rapid and robust influenza-specific IgG+ antibody-secreting plasma cell (ASC) response that peaked at approximately day 7 and accounted for up to 6% of peripheral blood B cells. These ASCs could be distinguished from influenza-specific IgG+ memory B cells that peaked 14-21 days after vaccination and averaged 1% of all B cells. Importantly, as much as 80% of ASCs purified at the peak of the response were influenza specific. This ASC response was characterized by a highly restricted B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire that in some donors was dominated by only a few B-cell clones. This pauci-clonal response, however, showed extensive intraclonal diversification from accumulated somatic mutations. We used the immunoglobulin variable regions isolated from sorted single ASCs to produce over 50 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bound to the three influenza vaccine strains with high affinity. This strategy demonstrates that we can generate multiple high-affinity mAbs from humans within a month after vaccination. The panel of influenza-virus-specific human mAbs allowed us to address the issue of original antigenic sin (OAS): the phenomenon where the induced antibody shows higher affinity to a previously encountered influenza virus strain compared with the virus strain present in the vaccine. However, we found that most of the influenza-virus-specific mAbs showed the highest affinity for the current vaccine strain. Thus, OAS does not seem to be a common occurrence in normal, healthy adults receiving influenza vaccination.

Title: Fine-epitope mapping of an antibody that binds the ectodomain of influenza matrix protein 2.
Abstract: Our previous work found that the monoclonal antibody 8C6, which recognized the epitope EVETPIRN on influenza A virus M2 protein, conferred protection against influenza virus challenge. In this study, 8C6 was used to screen the 7-mer phage peptide library in order to identify the crucial amino acid residues on the protective epitope EVETPIRN. Nine positive phage clones were selected by a test of dose-dependent binding activity to 8C6 after three rounds of panning. The phage clones exhibited a consensus motif (TXXR), which was found on the epitope EVETPIRN. Site-directed mutation analysis indicated that Thr and Arg on the epitope EVETPIRN played a key role in the recognition by 8C6. Furthermore, sequence alignment and analysis revealed that Thr and Arg on the epitope were highly conserved. Our results could provide useful information for influenza vaccine design based on M2 mimotope.

Reason: The paper focuses on epitope mapping of an antibody binding to influenza M2 protein, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Homologous recombination is very rare or absent in human influenza A virus.
Abstract: To determine the extent of homologous recombination in human influenza A virus, we assembled a data set of 13,852 sequences representing all eight segments and both major circulating subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1. Using an exhaustive search and a nonparametric test for mosaic structure, we identified 315 sequences (approximately 2%) in five different RNA segments that, after a multiple-comparison correction, had statistically significant mosaic signals compatible with homologous recombination. Of these, only two contained recombinant regions of sufficient length (>100 nucleotides [nt]) that the occurrence of homologous recombination could be verified using phylogenetic methods, with the rest involving very short sequence regions (15 to 30 nt). Although this secondary analysis revealed patterns of phylogenetic incongruence compatible with the action of recombination, neither candidate recombinant was strongly supported. Given our inability to exclude the occurrence of mixed infection and template switching during amplification, laboratory artifacts provide an alternative and likely explanation for the occurrence of phylogenetic incongruence in these two cases. We therefore conclude that, if it occurs at all, homologous recombination plays only a very minor role in the evolution of human influenza A virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates homologous recombination in influenza A virus sequences but does not link genotypes to phenotypes explicitly.

Title: Examining the hemagglutinin subtype diversity among wild duck-origin influenza A viruses using ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs and a novel RT-PCR method.
Abstract: This study presents an interconnected approach for circumventing two inherent limitations associated with studies defining the natural history of influenza A viruses in wild birds. The first limiting factor is the ability to maintain a cold chain from specimen collection to the laboratory when study sites are in more remote locations. The second limiting factor is the ability to identify all influenza A virus HA subtypes present in an original sample. We report a novel method for molecular subtyping of avian influenza A virus hemagglutinin genes using degenerate primers designed to amplify all known hemagglutinin subtypes. It was shown previously that templates larger than 200 bp were not consistently amplifiable from ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs. For this study, new primer sets were designed within these constraints. This method was used to perform subtyping RT-PCR on 191 influenza RNA-positive ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs obtained from 880 wild ducks in central Alaska in 2005. Seven different co-circulating hemagglutinin subtypes were identified in this study set, including H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8, and H12. In addition, 16% of original cloacal samples showed evidence of mixed infection, with samples yielding from two-to-five different hemagglutinin subtypes. This study further demonstrates the complex ecobiology of avian influenza A viruses in wild birds.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes a method for detecting HA subtypes in wild ducks but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Orthomyxo-, paramyxo- and flavivirus infections in wild waterfowl in Finland.
Abstract: Screening wild birds for viral pathogens has become increasingly important. We tested a screening approach based on blood and cloacal and tracheal swabs collected by hunters to study the prevalence of influenza A, paramyxo-, flavi-, and alphaviruses in Finnish wild waterfowl, which has been previously unknown. We studied 310 blood samples and 115 mixed tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from hunted waterfowl in 2006. Samples were screened by RT-PCR and serologically by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for influenza A (FLUAV), type 1 avian paramyxo-(APMV-1), Sindbis (SINV), West Nile (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) virus infections. FLUAV RNA was found in 13 tracheal/cloacal swabs and seven strains were isolated. Five blood samples were antibody positive. Six APMV-1 RNA-positive samples were found from which four strains were isolated, while two blood samples were antibody positive. None of the birds were positive for flavivirus RNA but three birds had flavivirus antibodies by HI test. No antibodies to SINV were detected. We conclude that circulation of both influenza A virus and avian paramyxovirus-1 in Finnish wild waterfowl was documented. The FLUAV and APMV-1 prevalences in wild waterfowl were 11.3% and 5.2% respectively, by this study. The subtype H3N8 was the only detected FLUAV subtype while APMV-1 strains clustered into two distinct lineages. Notably, antibodies to a likely mosquito-borne flavivirus were detected in three samples. The screening approach based on hunted waterfowl seemed reliable for monitoring FLUAV and APMV by RT-PCR from cloacal or tracheal samples, but antibody testing in this format seemed to be of low sensitivity.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study screens for presence of various viruses in wild waterfowl but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic evidence against evolutionary stasis and natural abiotic reservoirs of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Zhang et al. (G. Zhang, D. Shoham, D. Gilichinsky, S. Davydov, J. D. Castello, and S. O. Rogers, J. Virol. 80:12229-12235, 2006) have claimed to have recovered influenza A virus RNA from Siberian lake ice, postulating that ice might represent an important abiotic reservoir for the persistence and reemergence of this medically important pathogen. A rigorous phylogenetic analysis of these influenza A virus hemagglutinin gene sequences, however, indicates that they originated from a laboratory reference strain derived from the earliest human influenza A virus isolate, WS/33. Contrary to Zhang et al.'s assertions that the Siberian "ice viruses" are most closely related either to avian influenza virus or to human influenza virus strains from Asia from the 1960s (Zhang et al., J. Virol. 81:2538 [erratum], 2007), they are clearly contaminants from the WS/33 positive control used in their laboratory. There is thus no credible evidence that environmental ice acts as a biologically relevant reservoir for influenza viruses. Several additional cases with findings that seem at odds with the biology of influenza virus, including modern-looking avian influenza virus RNA sequences from an archival goose specimen collected in 1917 (T. G. Fanning, R. D. Slemons, A. H. Reid, T. A. Janczewski, J. Dean, and J. K. Taubenberger, J. Virol. 76:7860-7862, 2002), can also be explained by laboratory contamination or other experimental errors. Many putative examples of evolutionary stasis in influenza A virus appear to be due to laboratory artifacts.

Title: Epidemiologic characterization of the 1918 influenza pandemic summer wave in Copenhagen: implications for pandemic control strategies.
Abstract: The 1918-1919 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic killed approximately 50 million people worldwide. Historical records suggest that an early pandemic wave struck Europe during the summer of 1918. We obtained surveillance data that were compiled weekly, during 1910-1919, in Copenhagen, Denmark; the records included medically treated influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), hospitalizations, and deaths by age. We used a Serfling seasonal regression model to quantify excess morbidity and mortality, and we estimated the reproductive number (R) for the summer, fall, and winter pandemic waves. A large epidemic occurred in Copenhagen during the summer of 1918; the age distribution of deaths was characteristic of the 1918-1919 A/H1N1 pandemic overall. That summer wave accounted for 29%-34% of all excess ILIs and hospitalizations during 1918, whereas the case-fatality rate (0.3%) was many-fold lower than that of the fall wave (2.3%). Similar patterns were observed in 3 other Scandinavian cities. R was substantially higher in summer (2.0-5.4) than in fall (1.2-1.6) in all cities. The Copenhagen summer wave may have been caused by a precursor A/H1N1 pandemic virus that transmitted efficiently but lacked extreme virulence. The R measured in the summer wave is likely a better approximation of transmissibility in a fully susceptible population and is substantially higher than that found in previous US studies. The summer wave may have provided partial protection against the lethal fall wave.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper is an epidemiological characterization of the 1918 pandemic wave, focusing on morbidity, mortality, and transmission dynamics without explicit genotype-phenotype analysis.

Title: What the paediatrician needs to know when pandemic influenza arrives in clinical practice.
Abstract: Avian (H5N1) influenza or “bird ‘flu” has received considerable attention in both the medical literature and the mass media in the last few years. Despite the tabloids’ portrayal of an imminent threat, to date there have been relatively few cases in humans in spite of large numbers of infected poultry (Hien et al. 2004). However, this may be falsely reassuring. Most indications suggest that it is just a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs (Osterholm 2005). In the words of the UK Chief Medical Officer: “most experts believe that it is not a question of whether there will be another severe influenza pandemic but when” (Department of Health 2005). Although experts are agreed that a future influenza pandemic is almost inevitable, its timing is unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the virus responsible will be H5N1 or another, novel, influenza strain (Osterholm 2005). A recent editorial described avian influenza as a “predicament of extraordinary proportions” (Anonymous 2006). The next influenza pandemic will have a dramatic impact on all levels of health care including the everyday work of doctors. This chapter focuses on the clinical aspects of pandemic influenza about which paediatricians need to be familiar.

Title: Prediction of mutations engineered by randomness in H5N1 hemagglutinins of influenza A virus.
Abstract: This is the continuation of our studies on the prediction of mutation engineered by randomness in proteins from influenza A virus. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that randomness plays a role in engineering mutations because the measures of randomness in protein are different before and after mutations. Thus we built a cause-mutation relationship to count the mutation engineered by randomness, and conducted several concept-initiated studies to predict the mutations in proteins from influenza A virus, which demonstrated the possibility of prediction of mutations along this line of thought. On the other hand, these concept-initiated studies indicate the directions forwards the enhancement of predictability, of which we need to use the neural network instead of logistic regression that was used in those concept-initiated studies to enhance the predictability. In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to apply the neural network to modeling the cause-mutation relationship to predict the possible mutation positions, and then we use the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids at predicted positions. The results confirm the possibility of use of internal cause-mutation relationship with neural network model to predict the mutation positions and use of amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids.

Title: Evidence that the C-terminal PB2-binding region of the influenza A virus PB1 protein is a discrete alpha-helical domain.
Abstract: The influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a heterotrimer composed of PB1, PB2 and PA subunits and essential for viral replication. However, little detailed structural information is available for this important enzyme. We show by circular dichroism spectroscopy that polypeptides from the C-terminus of PB1 that are capable of binding efficiently to PB2 fold into stable alpha-helical structures. Structure prediction analysis of this region of PB1 indicates that it likely consists of a three-helical bundle. Deletion of any of the helices abrogated transcriptional function. Thus, PB1 contains a C-terminal alpha-helical PB2-binding domain that is essential for nucleotide polymerization activity.

Title: Ecologic immunology of avian influenza (H5N1) in migratory birds.
Abstract: The claim that migratory birds are responsible for the long-distance spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 rests on the assumption that infected wild birds can remain asymptomatic and migrate long distances unhampered. We critically assess this claim from the perspective of ecologic immunology, a research field that analyzes immune function in an ecologic, physiologic, and evolutionary context. Long-distance migration is one of the most demanding activities in the animal world. We show that several studies demonstrate that such prolonged, intense exercise leads to immunosuppression and that migratory performance is negatively affected by infections. These findings make it unlikely that wild birds can spread the virus along established long-distance migration pathways. However, infected, symptomatic wild birds may act as vectors over shorter distances, as appears to have occurred in Europe in early 2006.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is an ecological immunology study assessing migratory birds' ability to spread H5N1, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Phylogenetic analysis reveals the global migration of seasonal influenza A viruses.
Abstract: The winter seasonality of influenza A virus in temperate climates is one of the most widely recognized, yet least understood, epidemiological patterns in infectious disease. Central to understanding what drives the seasonal emergence of this important human pathogen is determining what becomes of the virus during the non-epidemic summer months. Herein, we take a step towards elucidating the seasonal emergence of influenza virus by determining the evolutionary relationship between populations of influenza A virus sampled from opposite hemispheres. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 487 complete genomes of human influenza A/H3N2 viruses collected between 1999 and 2005 from Australia and New Zealand in the southern hemisphere, and a representative sub-sample of viral genome sequences from 413 isolates collected in New York state, United States, representing the northern hemisphere. We show that even in areas as relatively geographically isolated as New Zealand's South Island and Western Australia, global viral migration contributes significantly to the seasonal emergence of influenza A epidemics, and that this migration has no clear directional pattern. These observations run counter to suggestions that local epidemics are triggered by the climate-driven reactivation of influenza viruses that remain latent within hosts between seasons or transmit at low efficiency between seasons. However, a complete understanding of the seasonal movements of influenza A virus will require greatly expanded global surveillance, particularly of tropical regions where the virus circulates year-round, and during non-epidemic periods in temperate climate areas.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and global migration patterns of influenza A viruses without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Influenza viruses and the evolution of avian influenza virus H5N1.
Abstract: Although small in size and simple in structure, influenza viruses are sophisticated organisms with highly mutagenic genomes and wide antigenic diversity. They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H5N1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead to the emergence of a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50% versus 2.5%), which killed 675000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide. While the clock is still ticking towards what seems to be inevitable pandemic influenza, on April 17, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against the avian influenza virus H5N1 for humans at high risk. However, more research is needed to develop a more effective and affordable vaccine that can be given at lower doses.

Title: Antiviral oseltamivir is not removed or degraded in normal sewage water treatment: implications for development of resistance by influenza A virus.
Abstract: Oseltamivir is the main antiviral for treatment and prevention of pandemic influenza. The increase in oseltamivir resistance reported recently has therefore sparked a debate on how to use oseltamivir in non pandemic influenza and the risks associated with wide spread use during a pandemic. Several questions have been asked about the fate of oseltamivir in the sewage treatment plants and in the environment. We have assessed the fate of oseltamivir and discuss the implications of environmental residues of oseltamivir regarding the occurrence of resistance. A series of batch experiments that simulated normal sewage treatment with oseltamivir present was conducted and the UV-spectra of oseltamivir were recorded. Our experiments show that the active moiety of oseltamivir is not removed in normal sewage water treatments and is not degraded substantially by UV light radiation, and that the active substance is released in waste water leaving the plant. Our conclusion is that a ubiquitous use of oseltamivir may result in selection pressures in the environment that favor development of drug-resistance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on environmental fate of the antiviral drug oseltamivir and implications for resistance development, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Visualization of microtubule-mediated transport of influenza viral progeny ribonucleoprotein.
Abstract: We developed a unique monoclonal antibody, mAb61A5, using the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain. Truncation and alanine substitution experiments showed that mAb61A5 recognized the NP fragment with residues 17 to 123 in which a conformational epitope formed by the beta1 sheet and the linker region between the alpha1 and alpha2 helices. Variations in the epitope or nearby can partly account for the poor mAb61A5 reactivity with the NP of A/Aichi/2/68 or A/duck/Pennsylvania/10128/84 strains. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that mAb61A5 preferentially interacted with viral ribonucleoprotein complexes, composed of RNA polymerase, negative/positive sense RNA and NP, rather than exogenously added NP. Immunofluorescence microscopy using mAb61A5 showed a punctate staining in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. The punctate NPs accumulated at the microtubule organizing center and co-localized with microtubules. The treatment with leptomycin B to block a CRM1-dependent nuclear export failed to produce the punctate NP. The treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, showed random distribution of the punctate NP in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that microtubule networks, although were not required for the formation of punctate structures, were responsible for the polarized distribution of the punctate NP antigens, most likely viral progeny ribonucleoprotein complexes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study describes monoclonal antibody recognition and intracellular transport of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The effect of population structure on the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics.
Abstract: The spread of H5N1 avian influenza and the recent high numbers of confirmed human cases have raised international concern about the possibility of a new pandemic. Therefore, antiviral drugs are now being stockpiled to be used as a first line of defence. The large-scale use of antivirals will however exert a strong selection pressure on the virus, and may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A few mathematical models have been developed to assess the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics. These models, however, neglected the spatial structure of large populations and the stochasticity of epidemic and demographic processes. To assess the impact of population structure and stochasticity, we modify and extend a previous model of influenza epidemics into a metapopulation model which takes into account the division of large populations into smaller units, and develop deterministic and stochastic versions of the model. We find that the dynamics in a fragmented population is less explosive, and, as a result, prophylaxis will prevent more infections and lead to fewer resistant cases in both the deterministic and stochastic model. While in the deterministic model the final level of resistance during treatment is not affected by fragmentation, in the stochastic model it is. Our results enable us to qualitatively extrapolate the prediction of deterministic, homogeneous-mixing models to more realistic scenarios.
Relevant: False
Reason: This modeling study focuses on population structure effects on drug resistance emergence without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Genetic characterization of HPAI (H5N1) viruses from poultry and wild vultures, Burkina Faso.
Abstract: Genetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) viruses from poultry and hooded vultures in Burkina Faso shows that these viruses belong to 1 of 3 sublineages initially found in Nigeria and later in other African countries. Hooded vultures could potentially be vectors or sentinels of influenza subtype H5N1, as are cats and swans elsewhere.

Title: Genome analysis linking recent European and African influenza (H5N1) viruses.
Abstract: To better understand the ecology and epidemiology of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in its transcontinental spread, we sequenced and analyzed the complete genomes of 36 recent influenza A (H5N1) viruses collected from birds in Europe, northern Africa, and southeastern Asia. These sequences, among the first complete genomes of influenza (H5N1) viruses outside Asia, clearly depict the lineages now infecting wild and domestic birds in Europe and Africa and show the relationships among these isolates and other strains affecting both birds and humans. The isolates fall into 3 distinct lineages, 1 of which contains all known non-Asian isolates. This new Euro-African lineage, which was the cause of several recent (2006) fatal human infections in Egypt and Iraq, has been introduced at least 3 times into the European-African region and has split into 3 distinct, independently evolving sublineages. One isolate provides evidence that 2 of these sublineages have recently reassorted.

Title: FluGenome: a web tool for genotyping influenza A virus.
Abstract: Influenza A viruses are hosted by numerous avian and mammalian species, which have shaped their evolution into distinct lineages worldwide. The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution.

Title: Characterization of low-pathogenic H5 subtype influenza viruses from Eurasia: implications for the origin of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are now endemic in many Asian countries, resulting in repeated outbreaks in poultry and increased cases of human infection. The immediate precursor of these HPAI viruses is believed to be A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD)-like H5N1 HPAI viruses first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996. From 2000 onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1 viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in Eurasia.

Reason: The paper characterizes genetic diversity and phylogenetics of low-pathogenic H5 viruses but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Emergence of drug resistance: implications for antiviral control of pandemic influenza.
Abstract: Given the danger of an unprecedented spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in humans, and great challenges to the development of an effective influenza vaccine, antiviral drugs will probably play a pivotal role in combating a novel pandemic strain. A critical limitation to the use of these drugs is the evolution of highly transmissible drug-resistant viral mutants. Here, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of an antiviral treatment strategy on the emergence of drug resistance and containment of a pandemic. The results show that elimination of the wild-type strain depends crucially on both the early onset of treatment in indexed cases and population-level treatment. Given the probable delay of 0.5-1 day in seeking healthcare and therefore initiating therapy, the findings indicate that a single strategy of antiviral treatment will be unsuccessful at controlling the spread of disease if the reproduction number of the wild-type strain (R0s) exceeds 1.4. We demonstrate the possible occurrence of a self-sustaining epidemic of resistant strain, in terms of its transmission fitness relative to the wild-type, and the reproduction number R0s. Considering reproduction numbers estimated for the past three pandemics, the findings suggest that an uncontrollable pandemic is likely to occur if resistant viruses with relative transmission fitness above 0.4 emerge. While an antiviral strategy is crucial for containing a pandemic, its effectiveness depends critically on timely and strategic use of drugs.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a mathematical modeling study on antiviral resistance emergence and pandemic control, not directly linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: First introduction of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A viruses in wild and domestic birds in Denmark, Northern Europe.
Abstract: Since 2005 highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia to Africa and Europe infecting poultry, humans and wild birds. HP H5N1 virus was isolated in Denmark for the first time in March 2006. A total of 44 wild birds were found positive for the HP H5N1 infection. In addition, one case was reported in a backyard poultry flock. Full-genome characterisation of nine isolates revealed that the Danish H5N1 viruses were highly similar to German H5N1 isolates in all genes from the same time period. The haemagglutinin gene grouped phylogenetically in H5 clade 2 subclade 2 and closest relatives besides the German isolates were isolates from Croatia in 2005, Nigeria and Niger in 2006 and isolates from Astrakhan in Russia 2006. The German and Danish isolates shared unique substitutions in the NA, PB1 and NS2 proteins. The first case of HP H5N1 infection of wild and domestic birds in Denmark was experienced in March 2006. This is the first full genome characterisation of HP H5N1 avian influenza A virus in the Nordic countries. The Danish viruses from this time period have their origin from the wild bird strains from Qinghai in 2005. These viruses may have been introduced to the Northern Europe through unusual migration due to the cold weather in Eastern Europe at that time.

Title: Design and validation of an H5 TaqMan real-time one-step reverse transcription-PCR and confirmatory assays for diagnosis and verification of influenza A virus H5 infections in humans.
Abstract: Increasing diversity among influenza H5N1 viruses has resulted in the need for sensitive and specific diagnostic assays, fully validated for the detection of H5 viruses belonging to all hemagglutinin (HA) clades, particularly the recently circulating H5N1 viruses of clade 2. In this report, the development and validation of a real-time, one-step TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay specific for the detection of influenza A H5 viruses from clades 1, 1', 2, and 3 is described. The real-time assay for H5 virus was shown to be highly sensitive, detecting H5 virus levels of <1 PFU from each of the HA clades. Specificity of the H5 RT-PCR for influenza A H5 viruses was demonstrated by using influenza A viruses of different subtypes, clinical samples containing influenza A viruses H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, influenza B viruses, and other respiratory viruses. The usefulness of the inclusion of a distinguishable assay positive control and of confirmatory assays for the laboratory diagnosis and verification of H5 virus infections was demonstrated. A real-time RT-PCR pyrosequencing assay, a restriction enzyme digestion assay, and direct sequencing of the H5 real-time RT-PCR amplicon were validated for the confirmation of H5 detection by the diagnostic real-time assay. The H5 real-time assay was applied to diagnostic testing for suspected cases of influenza A virus H5 infection in the United Kingdom. Influenza A H5 viruses were not detected in the cases analyzed; however, influenza A H3N2 virus was detected in 57% of the suspected cases of H5. The H5 TaqMan real-time RT-PCR and confirmatory assays will be useful tools for the laboratory surveillance and rapid diagnosis of H5 infections in humans.

Title: Avian influenza virus (H5N1): a threat to human health.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza virus has its origins in avian influenza viruses. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is already panzootic in poultry, with attendant economic consequences. It continues to cross species barriers to infect humans and other mammals, often with fatal outcomes. Therefore, H5N1 virus has rightly received attention as a potential pandemic threat. However, it is noted that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H5N1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H5N1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health. Here, we review the ecology and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, assess the pandemic risk, and address aspects of human H5N1 disease in relation to its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

Title: Potential risks associated with the proposed widespread use of Tamiflu.
Abstract: The threat of pandemic influenza has focused attention and resources on virus surveillance, prevention, and containment. The World Health Organization has strongly recommended the use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu both to treat and prevent pandemic influenza infection. A major concern for the long-term efficacy of this strategy is to limit the development of Tamiflu-resistant influenza strains. However, in the event of a pandemic, hundreds of millions of courses of Tamiflu, stockpiled globally, will be rapidly deployed. Given its apparent resistance to biodegradation and hydrophilicity, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active antiviral and metabolite of Tamiflu, is predicted to enter receiving riverwater from sewage treatment works in its active form. Our objective in this study was to determine the likely concentrations of OC released into U.S. and U.K. river catchments using hydrologic modeling and current assumptions about the course and management of an influenza pandemic. We predict that high concentrations of OC (micrograms per liter) capable of inhibiting influenza virus replication would be sustained for periods of several weeks, presenting an increased risk for the generation of antiviral resistance and genetic exchange between influenza viruses in wildfowl. Owing to the apparent recalcitrance of OC in sewage treatment works, widespread use of Tamiflu during an influenza pandemic also poses a potentially significant, uncharacterized, ecotoxicologic risk in each affected nation's waterways. To gauge the hazard presented by Tamiflu use during a pandemic, we recommend a) direct measurement of Tamiflu persistence, biodegradation, and transformation in the environment; b) further modeling of likely drug concentrations in the catchments of countries where humans and waterfowl come into frequent dose contact, and where significant Tamiflu deployment is envisaged; and c) further characterization of the risks of generating Tamiflu-resistant viruses in OC-exposed wildfowl.

Title: Challenges for the laboratory before and during an influenza pandemic.
Abstract: Laboratory tests that reliably confirm infection with a novel influenza strain are a major component of pandemic planning. Combined nose and throat swabs are the most practical respiratory tract sample to safely obtain from patients. As nucleic acid tests are sensitive, specific and rapid, they will be the diagnostic test of choice during a pandemic. Virus isolation (in laboratories with Physical Containment level 3 facilities) is required for characterisation of the pandemic strain and vaccine development. Antiviral resistance testing may be required if antiviral drugs are used extensively to help control a pandemic. Diagnostic strategies will vary throughout the various pandemic phases.

Title: Prevention of antigenically drifted influenza by inactivated and live attenuated vaccines.
Abstract: The efficacy of influenza vaccines may decline during years when the circulating viruses have antigenically drifted from those included in the vaccine. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy adults during the 2004-2005 influenza season and estimated both absolute and relative efficacies. A total of 1247 persons were vaccinated between October and December 2004. Influenza activity in Michigan began in January 2005 with the circulation of an antigenically drifted type A (H3N2) virus, the A/California/07/2004-like strain, and of type B viruses from two lineages. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine against both types of virus was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37 to 92) as measured by isolating the virus in cell culture, 75% (95% CI, 42 to 90) as measured by either isolating the virus in cell culture or identifying it through real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 67% (95% CI, 16 to 87) as measured by either isolating the virus or observing a rise in the serum antibody titer. The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine were 57% (95% CI, -3 to 82), 48% (95% CI, -7 to 74), and 30% (95% CI, -57 to 67), respectively. The difference in efficacy between the two vaccines appeared to be related mainly to reduced protection of the live attenuated vaccine against type B viruses. In the 2004-2005 season, in which most circulating viruses were dissimilar to those included in the vaccine, the inactivated vaccine was efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic illnesses from influenza in healthy adults. The live attenuated vaccine also prevented influenza illnesses but was less efficacious. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00133523.)

Title: Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza.
Abstract: The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into Asia, Europe, and Africa has resulted in enormous impacts on the poultry industry and presents an important threat to human health. The pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.

Title: Emergence and predominance of an H5N1 influenza variant in China.
Abstract: The development of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses in poultry in Eurasia accompanied with the increase in human infection in 2006 suggests that the virus has not been effectively contained and that the pandemic threat persists. Updated virological and epidemiological findings from our market surveillance in southern China demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses continued to be panzootic in different types of poultry. Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H5N1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005. Viruses from this sublineage gradually replaced those multiple regional distinct sublineages and caused recent human infection in China. These viruses have already transmitted to Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a new transmission and outbreak wave in Southeast Asia. Serological studies suggest that H5N1 seroconversion in market poultry is low and that vaccination may have facilitated the selection of the Fujian-like sublineage. The predominance of this virus over a large geographical region within a short period directly challenges current disease control measures.

Title: Influenza Virus Database (IVDB): an integrated information resource and analysis platform for influenza virus research.
Abstract: Frequent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza and the increasing data available for comparative analysis require a central database specialized in influenza viruses (IVs). We have established the Influenza Virus Database (IVDB) to integrate information and create an analysis platform for genetic, genomic, and phylogenetic studies of the virus. IVDB hosts complete genome sequences of influenza A virus generated by Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) and curates all other published IV sequences after expert annotation. Our Q-Filter system classifies and ranks all nucleotide sequences into seven categories according to sequence content and integrity. IVDB provides a series of tools and viewers for comparative analysis of the viral genomes, genes, genetic polymorphisms and phylogenetic relationships. A search system has been developed for users to retrieve a combination of different data types by setting search options. To facilitate analysis of global viral transmission and evolution, the IV Sequence Distribution Tool (IVDT) has been developed to display the worldwide geographic distribution of chosen viral genotypes and to couple genomic data with epidemiological data. The BLAST, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis tools were integrated for online data analysis. Furthermore, IVDB offers instant access to pre-computed alignments and polymorphisms of IV genes and proteins, and presents the results as SNP distribution plots and minor allele distributions. IVDB is publicly available at http://influenza.genomics.org.cn.

Title: [Diagnosis and Treatment of influenza--clinical investigation on viral shedding in children with influenza].
Abstract: Children with influenza usually shed viruses from the several days before onset of clinical symptoms, and viruses are isolated for one or two weeks after onset. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests are useful to guide use of antiviral agents, appears over 90% sensitivity and specificity for influenza A with nasopharyngeal specimens compared with cell culture. The detection limits of these test kits are 103 pfu or over, so it is necessary to consider viral load in clinical specimens for diagnosis with these kits. Viral load are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but influenza viruses are isolated in more than half of pediatric patients when fever get down, and resistant viruses are detected in some of these patients. It is very important for influenza control to investigate on viral shedding and resistant viruses.

Title: [Influenza virus receptors in the human airway].
Abstract: Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections have resulted in more than 100 human deaths; yet, human-to-human transmission is rare. We demonstrated that the epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans mainly possess sialic acid linked to galactose by alpha 2,6 linkages (SA alpha 2,6Gal), a molecule preferentially recognized by human viruses. However, many cells in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli possess SA alpha 2,3Gal, which is preferentially recognized by avian viruses. These facts are consistent with the observation that H5N1 viruses can be directly transmitted from birds to humans and cause serious lower respiratory tract damage in humans. Furthermore, this anatomical difference in receptor prevalence may explain why the spread of H5N1 viruses among humans is limited. However, since some H5N1 viruses isolated from humans recognize human virus receptors, additional changes must be required for these viruses to acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses receptor distribution and implications for transmission but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Evidence of influenza a virus RNA in siberian lake ice.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infects a large proportion of the human population annually, sometimes leading to the deaths of millions. The biotic cycles of infection are well characterized in the literature, including in studies of populations of humans, poultry, swine, and migratory waterfowl. However, there are few studies of abiotic reservoirs for this virus. Here, we report the preservation of influenza A virus genes in ice and water from high-latitude lakes that are visited by large numbers of migratory birds. The lakes are along the migratory flight paths of birds flying into Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. The data suggest that influenza A virus, deposited as the birds begin their autumn migration, can be preserved in lake ice. As birds return in the spring, the ice melts, releasing the viruses. Therefore, temporal gene flow is facilitated between the viruses shed during the previous year and the viruses newly acquired by birds during winter months spent in the south. Above the Arctic Circle, the cycles of entrapment in the ice and release by melting can be variable in length, because some ice persists for several years, decades, or longer. This type of temporal gene flow might be a feature common to viruses that can survive entrapment in environmental ice and snow.

Title: Influenza A virus infection of primary differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures derived from Syrian golden hamsters.
Abstract: The ability of several different influenza A virus strains to infect and replicate in primary, differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures from Syrian golden hamsters was investigated. All virus strains tested replicated equivalently in the cultures and displayed a preference for infecting nonciliated cells. This tropism correlated with the expression of both alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialic acid on the nonciliated cells. In contrast, the ciliated cells did not have detectable alpha2,6-linked sialic acid and expressed only low amounts of alpha2,3-linked sialic acid. In contrast to clinical isolates, laboratory strains of influenza A virus infected a limited number of ciliated cells at late times post-infection. The presence of alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialic acid residues on the same cell type suggests that Syrian golden hamsters and differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures derived from hamsters may provide a system for studying the reassortment of influenza A virus strains which utilize different forms of sialic acid as a primary virus receptor.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2005.
Abstract: Surveillance of influenza in Australia is based on laboratory isolation of influenza viruses, sentinel general-practitioner reports of influenza-like illness, and absenteeism data from a major national employer. In 2005, 4,575 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness were reported, which was 115 per cent higher than in 2004. The influenza season started in the first week of June, with peak activity in early August, a month earlier than in 2004. Influenza A was the predominant type notified (73%), while influenza B activity continued to increase compared to previous years. During 2005, the influenza notification rate amongst persons aged over 65 years (22 cases per 100,000 population) was 70 per cent higher than the mean rate of the last four years. One thousand one hundred and seventy-four influenza isolates from Australia were antigenically analysed: 689 were A(H3N2), 210 were A(H1N1) strains and 275 were influenza B viruses. Continued antigenic drift was seen with the A(H3N2) viruses from the previous reference strains with approximately one quarter of isolates being distinguishable from A/Wellington/1/2004-like viruses and more closely matched to A/California/7/2004-like viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a surveillance report describing influenza virus isolation and antigenic analysis without explicit investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Avian influenza H5N1 in viverrids: implications for wildlife health and conservation.
Abstract: The Asian countries chronically infected with avian influenza A H5N1 are 'global hotspots' for biodiversity conservation in terms of species diversity, endemism and levels of threat. Since 2003, avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have naturally infected and killed a range of wild bird species, four felid species and a mustelid. Here, we report fatal disseminated H5N1 infection in a globally threatened viverrid, the Owston's civet, in Vietnam, highlighting the risk that avian influenza H5N1 poses to mammalian and avian biodiversity across its expanding geographic range.
Relevant: False
Reason: The report documents natural infection of a viverrid by H5N1 virus but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Prospects for universal influenza virus vaccine.
Abstract: The current vaccination strategy against influenza A and B viruses is vulnerable to the unanticipated emergence of epidemic strains that are poorly matched by the vaccine. A vaccine that is less sensitive to the antigenic evolution of the virus would be a major improvement. The general feasibility of this goal is supported by studies in animal models that show that immunologic activities directed against relatively invariant viral determinants can reduce illness and death. The most promising approaches are based on antibodies specific for the relatively conserved ectodomain of matrix protein 2 and the intersubunit region of hemagglutinin. However, additional conserved determinants for protective antibodies are likely to exist, and their identification should be encouraged. Most importantly, infection and current vaccines do not appear to effectively induce these antibodies in humans. This finding provides a powerful rationale for testing the protective activity of these relatively conserved viral components in humans.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing prospects for universal influenza vaccines based on conserved viral components, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: Human influenza surveillance: the demand to expand.
Abstract: The World Health Organization Influenza Program is one of the best developed and longest running infectious disease surveillance systems that exists. It maintains a worldwide watch of influenza's evolution to assist delivery of appropriately formulated vaccines in time to blunt seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Despite the program's success, however, much more is possible with today's advanced technologies. This article summarizes ongoing human influenza surveillance activities worldwide. It shows that the technology to establish a high-throughput laboratory network that can process and test influenza viruses more quickly and more accurately is available. It also emphasizes the practical public health and scientific applications of such a network.

Title: Relaxed phylogenetics and dating with confidence.
Abstract: In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic methods and evolutionary rate estimation without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Development and application of reference antisera against 15 hemagglutinin subtypes of influenza virus by DNA vaccination of chickens.
Abstract: Reference antisera were produced against 15 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes using DNA vaccination to produce a high-quality polyclonal serum to the HA protein without antibodies to other influenza viral proteins. The HA gene from each of 15 different HA subtypes of influenza virus was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and injected intramuscularly, together with a cationic lipid, into 3- to 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. Birds were boostered twice at 4-week intervals after the initial injection, and in general, antibody titers increased after each boost. The antisera were successfully applied in the hemagglutination inhibition test, which is the standard method for the classification of the HA subtypes of influenza virus. We also demonstrated the HA specificity of the antisera by Western blot and immunodot blot analysis. DNA vaccination also provides a safer alternative for the production of HA-specific antibodies, since it is produced without the use of live virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes production of reference antisera against hemagglutinin subtypes but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: 1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics.
Abstract: The "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which caused approximately 50 million deaths worldwide, remains an ominous warning to public health. Many questions about its origins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health implications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt even as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a pandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new information about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example, sequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tissues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide answers to some critical questions. Understanding the 1918 pandemic and its implications for future pandemics requires careful experimentation and in-depth historical analysis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses historical and epidemiological aspects of the 1918 influenza pandemic without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Detailed analysis of the genetic evolution of influenza virus during the course of an epidemic.
Abstract: The genetic variability of influenza virus is usually studied with sequences selected over numerous years and countries, and rarely within a single season. Here we examined the viral evolution and the correlation between genetic and clinical features during an epidemic. From a French prospective household-based study in 1999-2000, 99 infected patients were randomly selected. The HA1 genomic domain was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of two groups of A/H3N2 viruses. We found no distinct pattern of genomic evolution within either group according to time. A spatial correlation with the nucleotide distances was shown. The average nucleotide diversity was 3.4x10-3 nucleotides per site, and did not differ between the groups. A lower number of segregating sites was observed in patients who experienced influenza-like symptoms during the previous epidemic. These results suggest that the influenza virus undergoes regular HA1 nucleotide changes, but without clonal expansion of mutant strains within a single epidemic.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of influenza virus during an epidemic but does not explicitly link genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Genetic comparison of H5N1 influenza A viruses isolated from chickens in Japan and Korea.
Abstract: Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by H5N1 virus occurred during 2003 to 2004 in Korea and Japan. The H5N1 viruses isolated in both countries were genetically similar at > 99% identity in the nucleotide sequences of all eight RNA segments, indicating that they belong to genotype V and are distinct from HPAI viruses prevalent in southeast Asia that belong to genotype Z. These findings indicate that the H5N1 viruses that caused the HPAI outbreaks in both Korea and Japan were derived from a common ancestor.

We have also determined that primarily cultured chicken lung cells can support the replication of both avian and human influenza viruses.

Title: Annual report of the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme, 2004.
Abstract: The National Influenza Surveillance Scheme includes data on influenza-like illness from sentinel general practitioner practices, laboratory reports of influenza from National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance Scheme and absenteeism data from a national employer. In 2004, 2,116 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness were reported, which was 41 per cent lower than the previous year. Peak activity was recorded in September, a month later than in 2003. Influenza A was again predominant while influenza B had an increased activity compared to the previous season. Four hundred and fifty-four isolates were antigenically analysed: 342 were A (H3N2 strain), 4 were A(H1N1 strain) strains and 108 were influenza B viruses. Further antigenic drift was seen in the A(H3N2) subtype with approximately one third of all isolates antigenically distinguishable from the A/Fujian/411/2002 reference strain. Vaccination coverage indicated that 79 per cent of Australians aged over 65 years received the 2004 influenza vaccine.

Title: Whole-genome analysis of human influenza A virus reveals multiple persistent lineages and reassortment among recent H3N2 viruses.
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of influenza A viruses in humans is important for surveillance and vaccine strain selection. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 156 complete genomes of human H3N2 influenza A viruses collected between 1999 and 2004 from New York State, United States, and observed multiple co-circulating clades with different population frequencies. Strikingly, phylogenies inferred for individual gene segments revealed that multiple reassortment events had occurred among these clades, such that one clade of H3N2 viruses present at least since 2000 had provided the hemagglutinin gene for all those H3N2 viruses sampled after the 2002-2003 influenza season. This reassortment event was the likely progenitor of the antigenically variant influenza strains that caused the A/Fujian/411/2002-like epidemic of the 2003-2004 influenza season. However, despite sharing the same hemagglutinin, these phylogenetically distinct lineages of viruses continue to co-circulate in the same population. These data, derived from the first large-scale analysis of H3N2 viruses, convincingly demonstrate that multiple lineages can co-circulate, persist, and reassort in epidemiologically significant ways, and underscore the importance of genomic analyses for future influenza surveillance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on phylogenetic analysis and reassortment among H3N2 viruses but does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Cross-species transfer of viruses: implications for the use of viral vectors in biomedical research, gene therapy and as live-virus vaccines.
Abstract: All living organisms are continuously exposed to a plethora of viruses. In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host-range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross-species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The opportunities for cross-species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live-vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross-species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host-range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.

Reason: This is a review discussing cross-species viral transfer and risks of viral vectors, without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage studies.

Title: Isolation, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and nucleoprotein genes of the Chilean equine influenza virus subtypes H7N7 and H3N8.
Abstract: We report here on the isolation and sequencing of the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and nucleoprotein genes of the Chilean equine influenza virus subtypes H7N7 (A/equi-1/Santiago/77, Sa77) and H3N8 (A/equi-2/Santiago/85, Sa85). The sequences obtained allowed a variability analysis, which indicated significant differences when compared with other isolates. We found that Chilean isolates are more similar to the North American variety than to European isolates. Isolate Sa77 is a good candidate for inclusion in a vaccine as it is the latest isolate of the subtype H7N7 and is probably better-adapted to the equine host. Isolate Sa85, of subtype H3N8, also appears to be a good candidate since it has no significant differences in the main antigenic sites with recent isolates.

Title: [Search of amantadine-resistance in influenza A strains isolated in Santiago, Chile, 2001-2002].
Abstract: Amantadine has been used for prevention and treatment of influenza A infection. It blocks the proton through the M2 ion channel. Drug-resistant viruses appear quickly when this therapy is used. Single amino acids changes in the H2 protein can confer resistance, being the most frequent one in position 31. Different methods to detect resistant strains have been described. The objectives were to determine the existence of amantadine resistance of influenza A strains isolated in a virologic laboratory in Santiago, Chile, between 2001-2002, and to validate a new molecular method to detect resistant strains. A PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was employed for the detection of resistant viruses. In 31 processed strains no mutation in the position 31 was found. This result supports that amantadine resistance is very low or absent in Chile. This could be explained by a limited use of this drug in the study population. This method could be used as a monitoring system to survey resistant viruses.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study detects amantadine resistance mutations but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes beyond resistance screening.

Title: Synthetic toll-like receptor 4 agonists stimulate innate resistance to infectious challenge.
Abstract: A compound family of synthetic lipid A mimetics (termed the aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates [AGPs]) was evaluated in murine infectious disease models of protection against challenge with Listeria monocytogenes and influenza virus. For the Listeria model, intravenous administration of AGPs was followed by intravenous bacterial challenge 24 h later. Spleens were harvested 2 days postchallenge for the enumeration of CFU. For the influenza virus model, mice were challenged with virus via the intranasal/intrapulmonary route 48 h after intranasal/intrapulmonary administration of AGPs. The severity of disease was assessed daily for 3 weeks following challenge. Several types of AGPs provided strong protection against influenza virus or Listeria challenge in wild-type mice, but they were inactive in the C3H/HeJ mouse, demonstrating the dependence of the AGPs on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling for the protective effect. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the activation of innate immune effectors by AGPs depends primarily on the lengths of the secondary acyl chains within the three acyl-oxy-acyl residues and also on the nature of the functional group attached to the aglycon component. We conclude that the administration of synthetic TLR4 agonists provides rapid pharmacologic induction of innate resistance to infectious challenge by two different pathogen classes, that this effect is mediated via TLR4, and that structural differences between AGPs can have dramatic effects on agonist activity in vivo.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study evaluates synthetic TLR4 agonists for innate immune stimulation, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Laboratory-based surveillance and molecular epidemiology of influenza virus in Taiwan.
Abstract: A laboratory-based surveillance network of 11 clinical virological laboratories for influenza viruses was established in Taiwan under the coordination of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Taiwan. From October 2000 to March 2004, 3,244 influenza viruses were isolated, including 1,969 influenza A and 1,275 influenza B viruses. The influenza infections usually occurred frequently in winter in the northern hemisphere. However, the influenza seasonality in Taiwan was not clear during the four seasons under investigation. For example, the influenza A viruses peaked during the winters of 2001, 2002, and 2003. However, some isolated peaks were also found in the summer and fall (June to November) of 2001 and 2002. An unusual peak of influenza B also occurred in the summer of 2002 (June to August). Phylogenetic analysis shows that influenza A isolates from the same year were often grouped together. However, influenza B isolates from the year 2002 clustered into different groups, and the data indicate that both B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like lineages of influenza B viruses were cocirculating. Sequence comparison of epidemic strains versus vaccine strains shows that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced. No clear seasonality of influenza reports in Taiwan occurred in contrast to other more continental regions.

Title: Surveillance for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in human influenza viruses from Australia.
Abstract: Two hundred and forty-five human influenza A and B viruses isolated in Australia between 1996 and 2003 were tested for their sensitivity to the NA inhibitor drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir using a fluorescence-based neuraminidase inhibition assay. Based on mean IC50 values, influenza A viruses (with neuraminidase subtypes N1 and N2) were more sensitive to both the NA inhibitors than were influenza B strains. Influenza A viruses with a N1 subtype and influenza B strains both demonstrated a greater sensitivity to zanamivir than to oseltamivir carboxylate, whereas influenza A strains with a N2 subtype were more susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate. A comparison of IC50 values for viruses isolated before and after the release of the NA inhibitors in Australia, found there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of strains to either neuraminidase inhibitor and none of the isolates tested showed clinically significant resistance.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study surveys neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza viruses but finds no significant resistance; it does not explicitly link specific genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Measuring T cell immunity to influenza vaccination in children after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Abstract: Quantitative assessment of immunogen-specific T cell responses may provide a meaningful surrogate marker of functional immunity in patients following haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We developed a flow-cytometric assay to quantify antigen-specific T cell immunity to influenza-A and studied the T cell response to influenza vaccination in five children, 3-21 months post-HSCT. All patients showed an increase in influenza-A-specific CD4(+) immunity following vaccination while none had a detectable IgG response to the vaccine. This assay proved sufficiently sensitive to evaluate changes in T cell memory in immunocompromised individuals and could be used to better characterize post-HSCT immune reconstitution.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study measures T cell immunity to influenza vaccination in children post-transplant; it does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: The Streptococcus pyogenes capsule is required for adhesion of bacteria to virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells and lethal bacterial-viral superinfection.
Abstract: An apparent worldwide resurgence of invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections remains unexplained. However, we recently demonstrated in mice that when an otherwise nonlethal intranasal GAS infection is preceded by a nonlethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection, induction of lethal invasive GAS infections is often the result. In the present study, we established several isogenic mutants from a GAS isolate and evaluated several virulence factors as candidates responsible for the induction of invasive GAS infections. Disruption of the synthesis of the capsule, Mga, streptolysin O, streptolysin S, or streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B of GAS significantly reduced mortality among mice superinfected with IAV and a mutant. In addition, the number of GAS organisms adhering to IAV-infected alveolar epithelial cells was markedly reduced with the capsule-depleted mutant, although this was not the case with the other mutants. Wild-type GAS was found to bind directly to IAV particles, whereas the nonencapsulated mutant showed much less ability to bind. These results suggest that the capsule plays a key role in the invasion of host tissues by GAS following superinfection with IAV and GAS.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies bacterial capsule role in adhesion to virus-infected cells and superinfection but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A DNA aptamer prevents influenza infection by blocking the receptor binding region of the viral hemagglutinin.
Abstract: Influenza A virus infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current means of control for influenza are based on prophylaxis by vaccines and on treatment by the available specific influenza neuraminidase inhibitor drugs. The approach taken in the present study is to prevent and/or ameliorate influenza infection by site-specific blocking of the viral binding to host cell receptors. We describe a novel oligonucleotide, known also as an aptamer, which has been designed to complement the receptor-binding region of the influenza hemagglutinin molecule. It was constructed by screening a DNA library and processing by the selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. We show that this DNA aptamer is indeed capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinin capacity of the virus, as well as in the prevention of viral infectivity in vitro, in tissue culture. Furthermore, it inhibits viral infection by different influenza strains in an animal model, as manifested by 90-99% reduction of virus burden in the lungs of treated mice. The mode of action of this aptamer is by blocking the binding of influenza virus to target cell receptors and consequently prevention of the virus invasion into the host cells.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on a DNA aptamer blocking the receptor binding region of hemagglutinin to prevent infection, but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Isolation and identification of swine influenza recombinant A/Swine/Shandong/1/2003(H9N2) virus.
Abstract: Ten influenza virus isolates were obtained from infected pigs from different places in Shandong province showing clinical symptoms from October 2002 to January 2003. All 10 isolates were identified in China's National Influenza Research Center as influenza A virus of H9N2 subtype. The complete genome of one isolate, designated A/Swine/Shandong/1/2003(H9N2), was sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank. The results of analyses indicated that the sequence of A/Swine/Shandong/1/2003(H9N2) was similar to those of several chicken influenza viruses and duck influenza viruses recently prevalent in South China. According to phylogenetic analysis of the complete gene sequences, A/Swine/Shandong/1/2003(H9N2) possibly originated from the reassortment of chicken influenza viruses and duck influenza viruses. It was found that the amino acid sequence at the HA cleavage site in Sw/SD/1/2003 is R-S-L-R-G, differing clearly from that of other H9N2 subtype isolates of swine influenza and avian influenza, which is R-S-S-R-G.

Title: Influenza as a model system for studying the cross-species transfer and evolution of the SARS coronavirus.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) moved into humans from a reservoir species and subsequently caused an epidemic in its new host. We know little about the processes that allowed the cross-species transfer of this previously unknown virus. I discuss what we have learned about the movement of viruses into humans from studies of influenza A, both how it crossed from birds to humans and how it subsequently evolved within the human population. Starting with a brief review of severe acute respiratory syndrome to highlight the kinds of problems we face in learning about this viral disease, I then turn to influenza A, focusing on three topics. First, I present a reanalysis of data used to test the hypothesis that swine served as a "mixing vessel" or intermediate host in the transmission of avian influenza to humans during the 1918 "Spanish flu" pandemic. Second, I review studies of archived viruses from the three recent influenza pandemics. Third, I discuss current limitations in using molecular data to study the evolution of infectious disease. Although influenza A and SARS-CoV differ in many ways, our knowledge of influenza A may provide important clues about what limits or favours cross-species transfers and subsequent epidemics of newly emerging pathogens.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review discussing influenza as a model for cross-species transfer and evolution of SARS coronavirus, without explicit experimental links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Matrix gene of influenza a viruses isolated from wild aquatic birds: ecology and emergence of influenza a viruses.
Abstract: Wild aquatic birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during >18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper presents phylogenetic analysis of matrix genes from influenza viruses in wild birds, focusing on ecology and gene pool diversity without explicit genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Influenza A virus PB1-F2 gene in recent Taiwanese isolates.
Abstract: Influenza A virus contains eight RNA segments and encodes 10 viral proteins. However, an 11th protein, called PB1-F2, was found in A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). This novel protein is translated from an alternative open reading frame (ORF) in the PB1 gene. We analyzed the PB1 gene of 42 recent influenza A isolates in Taiwan, including 24 H1N1 and 18 H3N2 strains. One H1N1 isolate and 17 H3N2 isolates contained the entire PB1-F2 ORF of 90 residues, three amino acids (aa) longer than the PB1-F2 of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 at the C terminal. The one remaining H3N2 isolate encoded a truncated PB1-F2 with 79 residues. The other 23 H1N1 isolates contained a truncated PB1-F2 of 57 aa. Phylogenetic analysis of both the HA and the PB1 genes showed that they shared similar clustering of these Taiwanese isolates, suggesting that no obvious reassortment occurred between the two genomic segments.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes presence and variation of the PB1-F2 gene in influenza isolates and phylogenetic clustering but does not explicitly link genotype to phenotype.

Title: Avian influenza: a new pandemic threat?
Abstract: In December 2003, the largest outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 occurred among poultry in 8 Asian countries. A limited number of human H5N1 infections have been reported from Vietnam and Thailand, with a mortality rate approaching 70%. Deaths have occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The main presenting features were fever, pneumonitis, lymphopenia, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and coryza were absent. The H5N1 strains are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, which can be used for treatment and prophylaxis. The widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. The threat of a future pandemic from avian influenza is real. Adequate surveillance, development of vaccines, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic influenza planning are important. This article summarizes the current knowledge on avian influenza, including the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this emerging disease.
Relevant: False
Reason: This is a review summarizing knowledge on avian influenza including virology and epidemiology, without explicit experimental genotype-phenotype linkage.

Title: Pandemic influenza: its origin and control.
Abstract: A "new" influenza virus will appear at some time in the future. This virus will arise by natural processes, which we do not fully understand, or it might be created by some bioterrorist. The world's population will have no immunity to the new virus, which will spread like wild-fire, causing much misery, economic disruption and many deaths. Vaccines will take time to develop and the only means of control, at least in the early stages of the epidemic, are anti-viral drugs, of which the neuraminidase inhibitors currently seem the most effective.

Title: Distinctive anti-influenza properties of recombinant collectin 43.
Abstract: Collectins play important roles in innate defence against viral, fungal and bacterial pathogens. CL-43, a bovine serum collectin, which appears to have evolutionarily evolved from surfactant protein D (SP-D), shows unique structural and functional properties. In the present study, we describe the initial characterization of a recombinant CL-43 expressed in mammalian cells. Like natural CL-43, the recombinant is secreted as trimeric forms that show a preference for mannose and N-acetyl mannosamine. The natural and recombinant proteins have significantly higher haemagglutination-inhibiting activity against influenza A virus (IAV) than recombinant trimeric forms of SP-D. In contrast with the more highly multimerized forms of SP-D, namely conglutinin or mannose-binding lectin, CL-43 did not induce viral or bacterial aggregation and did not enhance IAV-induced neutrophil H(2)O(2) generation. Like SP-D, CL-43 also strongly enhanced neutrophil uptake of IAV. However, the mechanism of this enhanced internalization is different from that of SP-D in that it did not require viral aggregation. These studies establish that the trimeric structure of CL-43 is specified by its primary sequence and indicate that this naturally occurring trimeric collectin has unique antiviral activities. These findings could facilitate the development of recombinant collectins with novel antimicrobial properties.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper characterizes antiviral properties of a recombinant collectin protein and does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Zanamivir: from drug design to the clinic.
Abstract: The development of the neuraminidase inhibitors has revolutionized the management options for influenza. Zanamivir was the first such inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of influenza in humans. It is delivered by inhalation to the respiratory tract, which is the site of viral replication, in order to ensure immediate antiviral activity. Early treatment with zanamivir in clinical trials rapidly reduced the severity and duration of influenza symptoms and associated complications. Furthermore, chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir was shown to be effective in the prevention of influenza illness. To date, there is no evidence for the emergence of clinically significant zanamivir-resistant isolates. In conclusion, zanamivir offers a useful complementary strategy to vaccination in the effective management of influenza.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on the clinical use and efficacy of zanamivir without explicit discussion of viral genotypes or phenotypes.

Title: Perspectives on antiviral use during pandemic influenza.
Abstract: Antiviral agents could potentially play a major role in the initial response to pandemic influenza, particularly with the likelihood that an effective vaccine is unavailable, by reducing morbidity and mortality. The M2 inhibitors are partially effective for chemoprophylaxis of pandemic influenza and evidence from studies of interpandemic influenza indicate that the neuraminidase inhibitors would be effective in prevention. In addition to the symptom benefit observed with M2 inhibitor treatment, early therapeutic use of neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of lower respiratory complications. Clinical pharmacology and adverse drug effect profiles indicate that the neuraminidase inhibitors and rimantadine are preferable to amantadine with regard to the need for individual prescribing and tolerance monitoring. Transmission of drug-resistant virus could substantially limit the effectiveness of M2 inhibitors and the possibility exists for primary M2 inhibitor resistance in a pandemic strain. The frequency of resistance emergence is lower with neuraminidase inhibitors and mathematical modelling studies indicate that the reduced transmissibility of drug-resistant virus observed with neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant variants would lead to negligible community spread of such variants. Thus, there are antiviral drugs currently available that hold considerable promise for response to pandemic influenza before a vaccine is available, although considerable work remains in realizing this potential. Markedly increasing the quantity of available antiviral agents through mechanisms such as stockpiling, educating health care providers and the public and developing effective means of rapid distribution to those in need are essential in developing an effective response, but remain currently unresolved problems.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper discusses antiviral use and resistance emergence in general terms without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: The evolution of human influenza viruses.
Abstract: The evolution of influenza viruses results in (i) recurrent annual epidemics of disease that are caused by progressive antigenic drift of influenza A and B viruses due to the mutability of the RNA genome and (ii) infrequent but severe pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes to which the population has little immunity. The latter characteristic is a consequence of the wide antigenic diversity and peculiar host range of influenza A viruses and the ability of their segmented RNA genomes to undergo frequent genetic reassortment (recombination) during mixed infections. Contrasting features of the evolution of recently circulating influenza AH1N1, AH3N2 and B viruses include the rapid drift of AH3N2 viruses as a single lineage, the slow replacement of successive antigenic variants of AH1N1 viruses and the co-circulation over some 25 years of antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses. Constant monitoring of changes in the circulating viruses is important for maintaining the efficacy of influenza vaccines in combating disease.

Title: Emergence of influenza A viruses.
Abstract: Pandemic influenza in humans is a zoonotic disease caused by the transfer of influenza A viruses or virus gene segments from animal reservoirs. Influenza A viruses have been isolated from avian and mammalian hosts, although the primary reservoirs are the aquatic bird populations of the world. In the aquatic birds, influenza is asymptomatic, and the viruses are in evolutionary stasis. The aquatic bird viruses do not replicate well in humans, and these viruses need to reassort or adapt in an intermediate host before they emerge in human populations. Pigs can serve as a host for avian and human viruses and are logical candidates for the role of intermediate host. The transmission of avian H5N1 and H9N2 viruses directly to humans during the late 1990s showed that land-based poultry also can serve between aquatic birds and humans as intermediate hosts of influenza viruses. That these transmission events took place in Hong Kong and China adds further support to the hypothesis that Asia is an epicentre for influenza and stresses the importance of surveillance of pigs and live-bird markets in this area.

Title: Expression of the DX5 antigen on CD8+ T cells is associated with activation and subsequent cell death or memory during influenza virus infection.
Abstract: The antigen recognized by the DX5 antibody (DX5 antigen) is expressed on all murine NK cells. In the present study we found that a proportion of CD8+ T cells (approximately 5%) also express the DX5 antigen in uninfected mice, and that numbers of CD8+ T cells expressing DX5 are significantly higher in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice representing up to 50% of all CD8+ T cells on day 10 post infection. The expression of the DX5 antigen on CD8+ T cells was associated with a memory phenotype in uninfected C57BL/6 mice and with an activation phenotype during influenza virus infection. Interestingly, when lymphocytes were isolated from lungs of influenza virus-infected mice on day 10 post infection and adoptively transferred into recombination activating gene-1 (RAG1)-deficient mice, CD8+DX5+ cells could not be recovered from the recipient mice 2 days later. Moreover, CD8+DX5+ cells were not detected when lung cells were removed from day 10 influenza virus-infected mice and cultured in vitro for 2 days. However, CD8+DX5+ cells could be detected when apoptosis inhibitors were added to these cultures, suggesting that the CD8+DX5+ cells underwent apoptosis during cell culture. Furthermore, almost all DX5 expressing CD8+ cells from lungs of mice on day 10 post influenza virus infection stained positively with Annexin-V. Taken together, the data suggest that CD8+ T cells expressing DX5 are associated with an activation/memory phenotype and are biased towards apoptosis.

Title: Asialoglycoprotein receptors on rat dendritic cells: possible roles for binding with Kupffer cells and ingesting virus particles.
Abstract: Rat dendritic cells selectively bind to Kupffer cells in vitro. The present study aimed to reveal adhesion molecules on dendritic cells and their roles in the host defense system. The in situ binding assay to examine the effects of pretreatment of dendritic cells with various kinds of monosaccharides suggested that N-acetylgalactosamine was necessary for the binding of dendritic cells to Kupffer cells. This binding was also attenuated when dendritic cells were injected into an ex vivo liver perfusion circuit together with N-acetyl-galactosamine. It was further shown that the majority of rat lymph dendritic cells and some interdigitating dendritic cells in the lymph nodes possessed asialoglycoprotein receptors specific for N-acetylgalactosamine/galactose as detected by immunostaining. Lymph dendritic cells could ingest virus particles in vitro, even though these cells showed no phagocytic activity for latex particles. The results indicate that rat dendritic cells possess asialoglycoprotein receptors which are probably utilized to recognize Kupffer cells for their recruitment to the liver and possibly to recognize virus particles prior to phagocytosis.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies asialoglycoprotein receptors on rat dendritic cells and their role in virus particle ingestion, focusing on host cell biology rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: A novel approach to antigen-specific deletion of CTL with minimal cellular activation using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I/peptide complex.
Abstract: In this study, we have compared the effector functions and fate of a number of human CTL clones in vitro or ex vivo following contact with variant peptides presented either on the cell surface or in a soluble multimeric format. In the presence of CD8 coreceptor binding, there is a good correlation between TCR signaling, killing of the targets, and FasL-mediated CTL apoptosis. Blocking CD8 binding using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I results in much reduced signaling and reduced killing of the targets. Surprisingly, however, FasL expression is induced to a similar degree on these CTLs, and apoptosis of CTL is unaffected. The ability to divorce these events may allow the deletion of antigen-specific and pathological CTL populations without the deleterious effects induced by full CTL activation.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on CTL effector functions and deletion using MHC class I mutants, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A screen of random sequences for those that alter the trafficking of the influenza virus hemagglutinin in vivo.
Abstract: In order to determine if the sequence patterns known to specify internalization represent the majority of possible internalization signals, we identified random sequences capable of causing a reporter protein to be internalized at least several-fold faster than the rate of non-selective internalization of membrane by clathrin-coated pits. A library of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, bearing short random sequences in place of the wild-type cytoplasmic domain, was prepared in recombinant SV40 virus. The library was expressed and screened for HAs that could internalize anti-HA antibody from the medium. The cytoplasmic sequences of the selected proteins were determined. From a small sample of sequences we detected several that did not resemble those previously identified. The known internalization signals must represent only a subset of the sequences that can serve as internalization signals.

Title: Effects of passage history and sampling bias on phylogenetic reconstruction of human influenza A evolution.
Abstract: In this paper we determine the extent to which host-mediated mutations and a known sampling bias affect evolutionary studies of human influenza A. Previous phylogenetic reconstruction of influenza A (H3N2) evolution using the hemagglutinin gene revealed an excess of nonsilent substitutions assigned to the terminal branches of the tree. We investigate two hypotheses to explain this observation. The first hypothesis is that the excess reflects mutations that were either not present or were at low frequency in the viral sample isolated from its human host, and that these mutations increased in frequency during passage of the virus in embryonated eggs. A set of 22 codons known to undergo such "host-mediated" mutations showed a significant excess of mutations assigned to branches attaching sequences from egg-cultured (as opposed to cell-cultured) isolates to the tree. Our second hypothesis is that the remaining excess results from sampling bias. Influenza surveillance is purposefully biased toward sequencing antigenically dissimilar strains in an effort to identify new variants that may signal the need to update the vaccine. This bias produces an excess of mutations assigned to terminal branches simply because an isolate with no close relatives is by definition attached to the tree by a relatively long branch. Simulations show that the magnitude of excess mutations we observed in the hemagglutinin tree is consistent with expectations based on our sampling protocol. Sampling bias does not affect inferences about evolution drawn from phylogenetic analyses. However, if possible, the excess caused by host-mediated mutations should be removed from studies of the evolution of influenza viruses as they replicate in their human hosts.
Relevant: False
Reason: This paper focuses on methodological issues in phylogenetic reconstruction and sampling bias, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Gamma interferon is not required for mucosal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses or heterosubtypic immunity to influenza A virus infection in mice.
Abstract: Heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) is defined as cross-protection against influenza virus of a different serotype than the virus initially encountered and is thought to be mediated by influenza virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Since gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) stimulates cytotoxic cells, including antigen-specific CTL which may control virus replication by secretion of antiviral cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and IFN-gamma, we have investigated the mechanism of HSI by analyzing the role of IFN-gamma for HSI in IFN-gamma gene-deleted (IFN-gamma(-/-)) mice. It has been reported that IFN-gamma is not required for recovery from primary infection with influenza virus but is important for HSI. Here, we conclusively show that IFN-gamma is not required for induction of secondary influenza virus-specific CTL responses in mediastinal lymph nodes and HSI to lethal influenza A virus infection. Although T helper 2 (Th2)-type cytokines were upregulated in the lungs of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice after virus challenge, either Th1- or Th2-biased responses could provide heterosubtypic protection. Furthermore, titers of serum-neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies to conserved nucleoprotein in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice did not differ significantly from those in immunocompetent mice. These results indicate that lack of IFN-gamma does not impair cross-reactive virus-specific immune responses and HSI to lethal infection with influenza virus. Our findings provide new insight for the mechanisms of HSI and should be valuable in the development of protective mucosal vaccines against variant virus strains, such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of host immune factors (IFN-gamma) in immune response to influenza infection, focusing on host phenotype rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Induction of CD4(+) T-cell-independent immunoglobulin responses by inactivated influenza virus.
Abstract: Through cognate interaction between antigen-specific B-cell and CD4(+) alphabeta T cells, the CD4(+) alphabeta T cells secrete cytokines that initiate immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching from IgM to IgG. In this study, we show that formalin-inactivated influenza PR8 virus induces virus-specific IgM and IgG responses in the absence of CD4(+) T cells and that all four subclasses of IgG are produced. The immunized CD4-deficient mice were also found to be completely protected against lethal infection with live, pathogenic influenza virus. The ability of CD4(+) T-cell-deficient mice to generate these IgG responses was not found to be impaired when these mice were depleted of CD8(+) T cells with an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody. In contrast, alphabeta T-cell-deficient mice (TCRbeta(-/-)) were not found to produce significant amounts of IgG upon immunization with formalin-inactivated PR8 virus. These results suggest that CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative alphabeta T cells are playing a role in regulating Ig class switching in the absence of CD4(+) T cells.

Title: Membrane fusion by surrogate receptor-bound influenza haemagglutinin.
Abstract: In influenza infections, haemagglutinin (HA) mediates the fusion of virus and cellular membranes at endosomal pH, between pH 5 and 6. In vitro, when reconstituted into virosomes, efficient fusion requires target membranes to contain sialic acid receptors or receptor analogues. In the experiments reported, lipid-associated anti-HA monoclonal Fab' fragments were used as surrogate receptors to investigate the fusion capacity of receptor-bound HA compared with unbound HA. The conclusions are drawn, in contrast to those from previous studies, that bound HA can mediate fusion and that fusion mainly involves bound HA when the liposome targets are densely packed with surrogate receptors.

Title: Molecular mapping of influenza virus RNA polymerase by site-specific antibodies.
Abstract: Influenza virus RNA polymerase with the subunit structure PB1-PB2-PA is involved in both transcription and replication of the RNA genome, including the unique cap-I-dependent RNase activity. To map the important domains for RNA polymerization, cap-I-dependent RNase, and cap-I-binding activity, we generated site-specific antibodies against overlapping 150-amino-acid peptides that cover each entire subunit. Monospecific antibodies against each subunit inhibited RNA synthesis in vitro. Those against PB1 and PB2 inhibited the cap-I-dependent RNase activity, but those against PB2 alone slightly inhibited the cap-I-binding activity. Antibodies against the N-terminal amino acids 1-159 of PB2 that overlap the PB1-binding site on PB2 and the C-terminal amino acids 501-617 of PA that overlap the putative nucleotide-binding site and PB1-binding site on PA inhibited RNA polymerizing activity as well as monospecific antibodies. Those against the N-terminal (amino acids 1-159); the central region (amino acids 305-559) of PB2, where a part of the cap-binding domain predicted previously is localized; the N-terminal (amino acids 1-222) of PB1; and amino acids 301-517 and 601-716 of PA inhibited the cap-I-dependent RNase activity. The cap-binding domain on PB2 could be mapped in amino acids 402-559, where one of the cap-binding domains mapped previously overlapped.

Title: Cu(II) inhibition of the proton translocation machinery of the influenza A virus M2 protein.
Abstract: The homotetrameric M2 integral membrane protein of influenza virus forms a proton-selective ion channel. An essential histidine residue (His-37) in the M2 transmembrane domain is believed to play an important role in the conduction mechanism of this channel. Also, this residue is believed to form hydrogen-bonded interactions with the ammonium group of the anti-viral compound, amantadine. A molecular model of this channel suggests that the imidazole side chains of His-37 from symmetry-related monomers of the homotetrameric pore converge to form a coordination site for transition metals. Thus, membrane currents of oocytes of Xenopus laevis expressing the M2 protein were recorded when the solution bathing the oocytes contained various transition metals. Membrane currents were strongly and reversibly inhibited by Cu2+ with biphasic reaction kinetics. The biphasic inhibition curves may be explained by a two-site model involving a fast-binding peripheral site with low specificity for divalent metal ions, as well as a high affinity site (Kdiss approximately 2 microM) that lies deep within the pore and shows rather slow-binding kinetics (kon = 18.6 +/- 0.9 M-1 s-1). The pH dependence of the interaction with the high affinity Cu2+-binding site parallels the pH dependence of inhibition by amantadine, which has previously been ascribed to protonation of His-37. The voltage dependence of the inhibition at the high affinity site indicates that the binding site lies within the transmembrane region of the pore. Furthermore, the inhibition by Cu2+ could be prevented by prior application of the reversible blocker of M2 channel activity, BL-1743, providing further support for the location of the site within the pore region of M2. Finally, substitutions of His-37 by alanine or glycine eliminated the high affinity site and resulted in membrane currents that were only partially inhibited at millimolar concentrations of Cu2+. Binding of Cu2+ to the high affinity site resulted in an approximately equal inhibition of both inward and outward currents. The wild-type protein showed very high specificity for Cu2+ and was only partially inhibited by 1 mM Ni2+, Pt2+, and Zn2+. These data are discussed in terms of the functional role of His-37 in the mechanism of proton translocation through the channel.

Title: Mutant influenza viruses with a defective NS1 protein cannot block the activation of PKR in infected cells.
Abstract: A short model genome RNA and also the genome RNA of influenza A virus bearing both 5'- and 3'-terminal common sequences activated the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, by stimulating autophosphorylation in vitro. The activated PKR catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). The NS1 protein efficiently eliminated the PKR-activating activity of these RNAs by binding to them. Two mutant NS1 proteins, each harboring a single amino acid substitution at different regions, exhibited temperature sensitivity in their RNA binding activity in the mutant virus-infected cell lysates as well as when they were prepared as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. The virus strains carrying these mutant NS1 proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity in virus protein synthesis at the translational level, as reported previously, and could not repress the autophosphorylation of PKR developing during the virus growth, which is normally suppressed by a viral function(s). As a result, the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation was elevated 2.5- to 3-fold. The defect in virus protein synthesis was well correlated with the level of phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2alpha.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study focuses on the function of the NS1 protein and its mutants in blocking PKR activation, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: A hairpin loop at the 5' end of influenza A virus virion RNA is required for synthesis of poly(A)+ mRNA in vitro.
Abstract: We present evidence, based on extensive mutagenesis, that a hairpin loop at the 5' end of influenza A virus virion RNA (vRNA) is required for the synthesis of polyadenylated mRNA from model vRNA templates in vitro. The hairpin loop, which we term the vRNA 5' hook, contains a stem of 2 bp formed by the second and third residues pairing with the ninth and eighth residues, respectively, and a 4-nucleotide loop composed of the intervening residues 4 to 7. Disruption of the base pairs of the vRNA 5' hook by introducing point mutations prevented polyadenylation, except in two mutants where a G-U base pair reformed. The polyadenylation activity of point mutants could be rescued by constructing double mutants with reformed base pairs in the stem of the vRNA 5' hook. These results suggest that base pairing rather than a particular nucleotide sequence was critical. We also show that mutation of the analogous region in the 3' arm of vRNA did not interfere with the synthesis of polyadenylated mRNA, suggesting that a hook structure in the 3' arm is not required for transcription of polyadenylated mRNA in vitro.

Title: The influenza virus M2 ion channel protein: probing the structure of the transmembrane domain in intact cells by using engineered disulfide cross-linking.
Abstract: The influenza A virus M2 integral membrane protein is an ion channel that permits protons to enter virus particles during uncoating of virions in endosomes, and it also modulates the pH of the trans-Golgi network in virus-infected cells. M2 protein is a homo-oligomer of 97 residues with a single transmembrane (TM) domain whose residues encompass the pore region of the channel and the biologically active form of the channel is a homotetramer. To understand the structural arrangement of the TM domains, each residue of the TM domain was changed in turn to cysteine, and oxidative disulfide cross-linking used to identify residues in close proximity. Oxidative treatment of M2 protein in membranes using iodine resulted in maximum cross-linking at TM domain residues 27, 34, and 41. Oxidation of M2 protein in membranes using the catalyst Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 resulted in cross-linking of many TM domain residues when the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 degreesC, suggesting that rotational movements of the TM domains in the membrane can occur. However, analysis of the kinetics of disulfide-linked dimer formation showed that TM domain residues 27, 30, 34, 37, and 41 formed most rapidly. Furthermore, when oxidation was performed at 4 degreesC, maximum cross-linking occurred at TM domain residues 27, 30, 34, 37, and 41. These positions correspond to the a and d positions of a heptad repeat. Thus these biochemical data are consistent with the TM domain region of the M2 tetramer forming a four-helix bundle. Analysis of the disulfide bonds that formed when oxidation of M2 protein in membranes was performed at pH 5.2 showed greatly reduced cross-linking at TM domain residues 40, 42, and 43 than that found at pH 7.4. This pH-dependent change in cross-linking of residues toward the cytoplasmic side of the TM domain parallels with the activation of the M2 ion channel at low pH.

Title: Heterosubtypic immunity to lethal influenza A virus infection is associated with virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses induced in mucosa-associated tissues.
Abstract: Heterosubtypic immunity, defined as cross-reactive immune responses to influenza virus of a different serotype than the virus initially encountered, was investigated in association with virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses induced in systemic and mucosa-associated lymph nodes after immunization via different routes. Mice immunized by the pulmonary route with live nonpathogenic influenza virus, strain Udorn (H3N2), survived challenge with mouse-adapted pathogenic influenza virus, strain PR/8/34 (H1N1). These mice developed strong heterosubtypic CTL responses in spleen, cervical lymph nodes (CLN), and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN). Alternately, only 20% of mice immunized intravenously, intraperitoneally, or intranasally survived the challenge; all of these developed CTL responses in spleen and CLN, but not in MLN. Direct correlation between short-term and long-term memory heterosubtypic CTL responses induced in MLN and host recovery after lethal infection indicates that these CTL responses may play an important role in heterosubtypic immunity. Furthermore, induction and maintenance of memory CTL in regional mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues are highly dependent on mucosal immunization. The results implicate the mechanism of heterosubtypic immunity and should be an important consideration in the development of protective mucosal vaccines against variant strains of influenza and HIV.

Title: Interactions of influenza virus with cultured cells: detailed kinetic modeling of binding and endocytosis.
Abstract: We performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the uptake of influenza virus (A/PR8/34) by Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in culture. Experimental procedures were based on the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of the fluorescent probe octadecylrhodamine B chloride (R18) incorporated in the viral envelope. Equilibrium for binding of influenza virus to MDCK cells (2.5 x 10(6)/mL) was reached quicker with temperature increases due to a faster dynamic mobility of the particles. We deduced that there are two kinds of binding sites for influenza virus in MDCK cells and determined the kinetic parameters of the binding process (adhesion and detachment rate constants), using a mass action kinetic model. As the temperature increases, the number of binding sites for influenza virus decreases, especially the high-affinity binding sites, whereas the value of the affinity constant for virus binding to the binding site, k, increases. Nevertheless, the binding association constant at equilibrium Ki, which is given by Ki = Niki, where Ni is the number of binding sites per cell, declines as the temperature increases. When endocytosis occurs, the total uptake of virions by the cells is larger than that observed in the process of binding at the same temperature, and the uptake proceeds for longer times. Using our mass kinetic model, we determined that at 20 degrees C, the rate constant of endocytosis, epsilon, for influenza virus with this cell line is 2.6 x 10(-)4 s-1, i.e., in the same range as in studies on endocytosis of liposomes.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper models influenza virus binding and endocytosis kinetics in cultured cells, focusing on viral entry mechanisms without explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene replicates in interferon-deficient systems.
Abstract: The NS1 protein is the only nonstructural protein encoded by influenza A virus. It has been proposed that the NS1 performs several regulatory functions during the viral replication cycle, including the regulation of synthesis, transport, splicing, and translation of mRNAs. Through the use of reverse genetics, a viable transfectant influenza A virus (delNS1) which lacks the NS1 gene has been generated. Our results indicate that the NS1 of influenza A virus is an auxiliary (virulence) factor which plays a crucial role in inhibiting interferon-mediated antiviral responses of the host.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes replication of influenza virus lacking the NS1 gene in interferon-deficient systems, focusing on viral replication and host response rather than explicit genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Role of GM1 binding in the mucosal immunogenicity and adjuvant activity of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and its B subunit.
Abstract: Escherichia coli (E. coli) heat-labile toxin (LT) is a potent mucosal immunogen and immunoadjuvant towards co-administered antigens. LT is composed of one copy of the A subunit, which has ADP-ribosylation activity, and a homopentamer of B subunits, which has affinity for the toxin receptor, the ganglioside GM1. Both the ADP-ribosylation activity of LTA and GM1 binding of LTB have been proposed to be involved in immune stimulation. We investigated the roles of these activities in the immunogenicity of recombinant LT or LTB upon intranasal immunization of mice using LT/LTB mutants, lacking either ADP-ribosylation activity, GM1-binding affinity, or both. Likewise, the adjuvant properties of these LT/LTB variants towards influenza virus subunit antigen were investigated. With respect to the immunogenicity of LT and LTB, we found that GM1-binding activity is essential for effective induction of anti-LTB antibodies. On the other hand, an LT mutant lacking ADP-ribosylation activity retained the immunogenic properties of the native toxin, indicating that ADP ribosylation is not critically involved. Whereas adjuvanticity of LTB was found to be directly related to GM1-binding activity, adjuvanticity of LT was found to be independent of GM1-binding affinity. Moreover, a mutant lacking both GM1-binding and ADP-ribosylation activity, also retained adjuvanticity. These results demonstrate that neither ADP-ribosylation activity nor GM1 binding are essential for adjuvanticity of LT, and suggest an ADP-ribosylation-independent adjuvant effect of the A subunit.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study investigates the role of GM1 binding in immunogenicity and adjuvant activity of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, unrelated to viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: Importance of a conserved TCR J alpha-encoded tyrosine for T cell recognition of an HLA B27/peptide complex.
Abstract: Human HLA B27-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the influenza A epitope NP383-391 use similar TCR alpha and beta chains, with two closely related J alpha segments used by six of nine CTL clones from three unrelated donors (Bowness et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1993. 23: 1417-1421). The role of TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR)3alpha residues 93 and 100-102 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis, following expression of the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains from one clone as a TCR zeta fusion heterodimer in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. For the first time we have measured direct binding of tetrameric HLA B*2705/NP383-391 complexes to transfected TCR. Independently peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC) were used to induce TCR-mediated degranulation of RBL transfectants. Our results show a key role for the conserved TCRalpha CDR3 J alpha-encoded residue Y102 in recognition of HLA B27/NP383-391. Thus the Y102D mutation abolished both tetramer binding and degranulation in the presence of peptide-pulsed APC. Even the Y102F mutation, differing only by a single hydroxyl group from the native TCR, abolished detectable degranulation. Further mutations F93A and S100R also abolished recognition. Interestingly, the N101A mutation recognized HLA B27/NP in functional assays despite having significantly reduced tetramer binding, a finding consistent with "kinetic editing" models of T cell activation. Modeling of the GRb TCR CDR3alpha loop suggests that residue Y102 contacts the HLA B*2705 alpha1 helix. It is thus possible that selection of germ-line TCRAJ-encoded residues at position 102 may be MHC driven.

Title: Modulation of promiscuous T cell receptor recognition by mutagenesis of CDR2 residues.
Abstract: The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes a ligand composed of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and a peptide antigen. Prior studies of murine T cell clones have demonstrated that residues in the CDR3 region of TCR interact with amino acids in the peptide during MHC-restricted antigen recognition. However, the questions of whether direct TCR MHC contacts are made and where such contact sites might map in the TCR have not been resolved. In this study, we have taken advantage of the promiscuous recognition of a peptide from influenza virus (HA 307-319) by human T cell clones to map sites in the TCR that mediate differences in human leukocyte antigen-D related (HLA-DR) restriction in the presence of a common peptide antigen. Site-specific mutagenesis of cloned TCR genes and transfection into Jurkat cells were used to demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in CDR2 of the TCR-alpha chain controlled whether a T cell was restricted by the product of a single DR allele (DR7) or would respond to the HA 307-319 peptide when presented by the products of one of several different DR alleles (DR1, DR4, DR5, or DR7). Because the relevant DR alleles are defined by polymorphism in the DR-beta chain, these results also suggest a rotational orientation for recognition in which TCR-alpha interacts with DR beta.

Reason: The paper studies T cell receptor recognition and mutagenesis but focuses on host immune receptor rather than viral genotype-phenotype relationships.

Title: An amino-terminal polypeptide fragment of the influenza virus NS1 protein possesses specific RNA-binding activity and largely helical backbone structure.
Abstract: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus has the unique property of binding to three apparently different RNAs: poly A; a stem-bulge in U6 small nuclear RNA; and double-stranded RNA. One of our major goals is to determine how the NS1 protein recognizes and binds to its several RNA targets. As the first step for conducting structural studies, we have succeeded in identifying a fragment of the NS1 protein that possesses all the RNA-binding activities of the full-length protein. The RNA-binding fragment consists of the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein. We have developed procedures for obtaining large amounts of the polypeptide in pure form. This has enabled us to establish the RNA-binding properties of this polypeptide and to demonstrate that it retains the ability to dimerize exhibited by the full-length protein. In addition, far-UV CD spectroscopy indicates that this RNA-binding polypeptide is largely (approximately 80%) helical, suggesting that the mode of dimerization of the NS1 protein and of its interaction with RNA is mediated, at least in part, by helices.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on identifying an RNA-binding fragment of the NS1 protein and its structural properties, without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: A 48-amino-acid region of influenza A virus PB1 protein is sufficient for complex formation with PA.
Abstract: The concerted activity of four influenza virus proteins, PB1, PB2, PA, and NP is necessary and sufficient for transcription and replication of the viral genome in the nucleus of the cell. The three P proteins form a heterotrimeric complex in virions and the nuclei of infected cells. Biochemical analyses have shown specific interactions between PB1 and PA as well as PB1 and PB2, indicating that PB1 is the backbone of the complex. To identify domains of PB1 involved in binding PA, a two-hybrid system adapted for mammalian cells (CV-1) was implemented. First, we demonstrate the ability of PB1 and PA to interact efficiently and specifically in reciprocal combinations of two-hybrid reporter moieties, suggesting that transcription factor module fusion did not interfere sterically or allosterically with interaction between PB1 and PA. Subsequent analyses with a set of chimeric proteins with truncations of the PB1 C termini, N termini, or internal sequences led to the identification of a region at the N terminus of PB1 responsible for binding PA. Forty-eight amino acids at the N terminus of PB1 were sufficient for binding PA in vivo with the same efficiency as the complete PB1 protein. This region of PB1 responsible for binding PA does not overlap with other previously described PB1 functional domains involved in nuclear transport and RNA polymerization. We propose to name this region of interaction with PA domain alpha, to differentiate it from other functional domains described for PB1.
Relevant: False
Reason: The study identifies a domain in PB1 responsible for binding PA, focusing on protein-protein interaction domains without linking genotype changes to phenotypic outcomes.

Title: Suppression of influenza virus infection by an N-thioacetylneuraminic acid acrylamide copolymer resistant to neuraminidase.
Abstract: We have previously shown that alpha-2-O-methyl-5-N-thioacetylneuraminic acid (alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me) has a higher affinity to bromelain-treated hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus than sialic acid from natural sources (Machytka et al., 1993, FEBS Lett. 334, 117-120). We have now compared the inhibitory effects of alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me and other sialic acid analogs on receptor binding and plaque formation of intact influenza A viruses. When alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me was polymerized by conjugation to polyacrylamide, its affinity to HA increased 10(3)-fold. When analyzed by plaque reduction, the alpha-Neu5thioAc2 polymer was about 10 times more efficient as an inhibitor of virus replication than the alpha-Neu5Ac2 polymer, stressing the importance of sulfur at C5. The S-glycoside alpha-2-S-methyl-5-N-thioacetylneuraminic acid (alpha-Neu5thioAc2SMe) had the same affinity to HA as alpha-Neu5thioAc2Me, but was resistant to neuraminidase. The alpha-Neu5thioAc2S polymer interfered with the replication of a wider spectrum of influenza A virus subtypes than the alpha-Neu5thioAc2 polymer. The results indicate that the alpha-Neu5thioAc2S polymer has the potential to be used as an inhibitor of influenza virus infection.

Title: Prevalence and activation phenotype of Sendai virus-specific CD4+ T cells.
Abstract: The relative prevalence of Sendai virus-specific CD4+ T helper precursors (Thp) has been assessed by limiting dilution analysis (LDA). Within 10 days after intranasal inoculation of C57BL/6 mice, Thp prevalence increased from < 1 in 10(5) to approximately 1 in 200 in CD4+ T-cell-enriched spleen and mediastinal lymph node populations. These frequencies remained elevated relative to naive animals, with the majority of the Thp recovered at 2-3 months after infection being found in the spleen. The "memory" Thp express an "activated" L-selectin-low, CD44-high, alpha 4-integrin-high phenotype, comparable to that described previously for CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) specific for Sendai virus. Background effects for the IL-2-based Thp analysis are, however, less predictable than those found previously for the 51Cr release CTLp LDA, as the extent of non-virus-specific lymphokine production varies. However, provided the analysis is appropriately controlled, the approach does allow useful comparisons between phenotypically different subsets of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.
Relevant: False

Title: Identification of annexin 33 kDa in cultured cells as a binding protein of influenza viruses.
Abstract: The binding of three influenza A and one influenza B virus strains to proteins of three continuously cultured cell lines was studied using protein overlay and immunostaining methods. The results obtained indicated the presence of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent binding of the virus strains; virus binding to proteins in the molecular mass range from about 40 to 103 kDa was dependent on sialic acid, whereas binding to the 33 kDa protein was independent of sialic acid. The 33 kDa binding protein was identified as annexin, a widely distributed non-glycosylated calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein.

Title: Molecular dissection of influenza virus nucleoprotein: deletion mapping of the RNA binding domain.
Abstract: Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is associated with the genome RNA, forming ribonucleoprotein cores. To identify the amino acid sequence involved in RNA binding, we performed Northwestern blot analysis with a set of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of NP produced in Escherichia coli. The RNA binding region has been mapped between amino acid residues 91 and 188, a stretch of residues that contains a sequence that is not only highly conserved among NPs from A-, B-, and C-type influenza viruses but also similar to the RNA binding domain of a plant virus movement protein.

Title: The influenza virus panhandle is involved in the initiation of transcription.
Abstract: The role of the influenza A virus panhandle structure formed from the 3'- and 5'-terminal nucleotides of virion RNA segments was studied in both an RNA polymerase binding assay and an in vitro transcription assay. Despite recent indications that promoter activity is simply a function of the 3'-terminal sequence of virion RNA, our results show that both 3'- and 5'-terminal sequences are involved in the initiation of transcription. We propose a new model for the initiation of transcription which has implications for the mechanisms by which influenza virus transcription, replication, and polyadenylation may be regulated in the infected cell.

Title: Effect of simultaneous administration of cold-adapted and wild-type influenza A viruses on experimental wild-type influenza infection in humans.
Abstract: On the basis of the ability of the attenuated cold-adapted strain of influenza A virus to suppress disease production in ferrets simultaneously infected with epidemic influenza virus (P. Whitaker-Dowling, H.F. Maassab, and J.S. Youngner, J. Infect. Dis. 164:1200-1202, 1991), an evaluation of the ability of the cold-adapted virus to modify clinical disease in humans was made. Adult volunteers with prechallenge serum hemagglutination-inhibition titers to the influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus of < or = 1:8 received either 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses of the wild-type A/Kawasaki virus or a mixture of 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses of each of the wild-type virus and a cold-adapted A/Kawasaki reassortant virus by intranasal drops in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Symptoms and wild-type virus shedding were assessed daily for 6 days following challenge. Results were compared with those derived from another group of volunteers who received only cold-adapted virus. Volunteers who received the mixed inoculum of cold-adapted and wild-type viruses had lower symptom scores than those who received wild-type virus alone, suggesting that coinfection with the cold-adapted virus may modify wild-type virus infection, but the differences were not statistically significant in this small study. The data demonstrate that administration of cold-adapted influenza A virus to humans at the time of wild-type virus infection is a safe procedure.

Reason: The paper evaluates clinical effects of co-infection with cold-adapted and wild-type viruses but does not analyze viral genotypes or their phenotypic consequences.

Title: Analysis of the signals for polarized transport of influenza virus (A/WSN/33) neuraminidase and human transferrin receptor, type II transmembrane proteins.
Abstract: In polarized MDCK cells influenza virus (A/WSN/33) neuraminidase (NA) and human transferrin receptor (TR), type II glycoproteins, when expressed from cloned cDNAs, were transported and accumulated preferentially on the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively. We have investigated the signals for polarized sorting by constructing chimeras between NA and TR and by making deletion mutants. NATR delta 90, which contains the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of NA and the ectodomain of TR, was found to be localized predominantly on the apical membrane, whereas TRNA delta 35, containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of TR and the ectodomain of NA, was expressed preferentially on the basolateral membrane. TR delta 57, a TR deletion mutant lacking 57 amino acids in the TR cytoplasmic tail, did not exhibit any polarized expression and was present on both apical and basolateral surfaces, whereas a deletion mutant (NA delta 28-35) lacking amino acid residues from 28 to 35 in the transmembrane domain of NA resulted in secretion of the NA ectodomain predominantly from the apical side. These results taken together indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of TR was sufficient for basolateral transport, but influenza virus NA possesses two sorting signals, one in the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domain and the other within the ectodomain, both of which are independently able to transport the protein to the apical plasma membrane.

Title: In vitro and in vivo inhibition of ortho- and paramyxovirus infections by a new class of sulfonic acid polymers interacting with virus-cell binding and/or fusion.
Abstract: A series of sulfonic acid polymers were shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus. The compounds inhibit the replication of RSV and influenza A virus in HeLa and MDCK cells, at concentrations of 0.16 and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and are nontoxic to growing cells at concentrations of > 100 micrograms/ml. The mode of antiviral action of the sulfonic acid polymers can be ascribed to inhibition of virus-cell fusion (for influenza A virus) or inhibition of both virus-cell binding and fusion (for RSV). The sulfonic acid prototype PAMPS [poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid)], when administered intranasally to mice as a single dose of 10 or 50 mg per kg of body weight at the time of infection, completely inhibited influenza A virus replication (in lungs) and virus-associated lung consolidation in immunocompetent mice and completely protected NMRI and SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice against influenza A virus-associated mortality. When administered 1 h before or after virus inoculation, no protective effect was observed at a dose of 10 or 100 mg/kg. Sulfonic acid polymers exert selective inhibitory effects on RSV and influenza A virus replication.

Title: Characterization of the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA.
Abstract: It has been shown that a stretch of uridines (U's) near the 5' end of the virion RNA of influenza A virus is the polyadenylation site for viral mRNA synthesis. In addition, the RNA duplex made up the 3' and 5' terminal sequences adjacent to the U stretch is also involved in polyadenylation. We have further characterized the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA with a ribonucleoprotein transfection system. We found that the optimal length of the U stretch is 5 to 7 uridine residues. We also showed that the upstream sequence at the 5' end is not involved in polyadenylation and that the optimal distance between the 5' end and the U stretch is 16 nucleotides. The combination of these features defines the polyadenylation site and differentiates this signal from other U stretches scattered throughout the genomes of influenza viruses.

Title: IgG3 reactive rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis: etiologic and pathogenic considerations.
Abstract: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a polyclonal autoantibody directed against the Fc portion of IgG. Although the role of RF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear, immune complexes that form between RF and IgG can activate the classical complement (C) pathway, leading to pathogenic outcomes involving inflammatory events and tissue damage. The specificity of serum RF and RF produced by rheumatoid synovial cells (RSC) is different. Serum RF has specificity for rabbit IgG and human IgG subclasses IgG1, 2, and 4, but binds poorly to IgG3. The affinity of serum RF for IgG Fc is low, having an association constant of 10(4)-10(5) M-1. RSC RF, however, has specificity for human IgG and high avidity for IgG3. Because of this greater specificity and avidity for IgG3, and because RSC RF may be pathogenically more important than serum RF, an important role for IgG3-reactive RF in RA may exist. Binding of RF to IgG may be dependent on the allotype and glycosylation of IgG. Infectious agents present in RA patients may directly or indirectly induce the production of certain RF. In this communication, we review and expand on several observations examining the role of IgG3-reactive RF in RA including: 1) binding differences between RF derived from RSC and serum; 2) glycosylation characteristics of IgG and its interaction with RF; 3) apparent allotype dependent binding of IgG3-reactive RF; and 4) possible relationship between infectious agents and the production of IgG3-reactive RF. Taken together, these observations suggest an important role for IgG3-reactive RF in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of RA.

Title: Response to influenza infection in mice with a targeted disruption in the interferon gamma gene.
Abstract: Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells and has been noted to be a first line of host defense in the control of viral infections. To examine further the role of this cytokine in the control of viral infections, mice with a targeted mutation in the IFN-gamma gene were infected with influenza virus, and the in vivo antibody and cell-mediated immune response to viral infection were examined. In addition, cell lines and clones were derived from the immunized animals and the in vitro cytokine production and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response were analyzed. The absence of IFN-gamma led to increased production of influenza-specific IgG1, IL-4, and IL-5 as compared to wild-type littermate control animals. In contrast, there was no difference noted in the development of an effective CTL response between IFN-gamma-deficient and wild-type animals. In this model of experimental influenza infection, IFN-gamma is not necessary for the development of an effective humoral or cellular immune response to challenge with this respiratory virus.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies immune response in IFN-gamma knockout mice infected with influenza virus but does not link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Behavioral thermoregulation in mice inoculated with influenza virus.
Abstract: Mice housed at 30 degrees C and inoculated with a mouse-adapted influenza virus show a fall in body temperature (Tb) and a decrease in food intake to almost 0 grams per day. This study tested whether the fall in Tb could be accounted for by the decreased food intake and whether the fall in Tb was due to a decrease of thermoregulatory set point or to an inability to maintain Tb at set point level. The fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice. When food deprived, mice given access to a thermal gradient increased their preference for warmer areas in the gradient and, as a result, Tb did not fall as much as Tb of starved mice not given access to a thermal gradient. When infected with influenza virus, mice given a thermal gradient decreased Tb less and at a slower rate than mice not given a gradient. However, this fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice given a thermal gradient. Mice given a thermal gradient increased their preference for the warmer temperatures after inoculation; this returned to preinoculation preference for cooler temperatures during the later days of infection despite a continuous fall in Tb. Influenza-infected mice given a thermal gradient survived significantly fewer days than infected mice not given a thermal gradient. We conclude that the influenza-induced fall of Tb in mice cannot be explained solely by the decrease in food intake, and is partially due to a decrease in thermoregulatory set point.
Relevant: False

Title: Mechanisms of mouse spleen dendritic cell function in the generation of influenza-specific, cytolytic T lymphocytes.
Abstract: We have evaluated the capacity of dendritic cells to function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for influenza and have examined their mechanism of action. Virus-pulsed dendritic cells were 100 times more efficient than bulk spleen cells in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) formation. The induction of CTLs required neither exogenous lymphokines nor APCs in the responding T cell population. Infectious virus entered dendritic cells through intracellular acidic vacuoles and directed the synthesis of several viral proteins. If ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated or bromelain-treated viruses were used, viral protein synthesis could not be detected, and there was poor induction of CTLs. This indicated that dendritic cells were not capable of processing noninfectious virus onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, UV-inactivated and bromelain-treated viruses were presented efficiently to class II-restricted CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cells crossreacted with different strains of influenza and markedly amplified CTL formation. Cell lines that lacked MHC class II, and consequently the capacity to stimulate CD4+ T cells, failed to induce CTLs unless helper lymphokines were added. Similarly, dendritic cells pulsed with the MHC class I-restricted nucleoprotein 147-155 peptide were poor stimulators in the absence of exogenous helper factors. We conclude that the function of dendritic cells as APCs for the generation of virus-specific CTLs in vitro depends measurably upon: (a) charging class I molecules with peptides derived from endogenously synthesized viral antigens, and (b) stimulating a strong CD4+ helper T cell response.
Relevant: False

Title: Positioning of a peptide in the cleft of HLA-A2 by complementing amino acid changes.
Abstract: Several mutant HLA-A2 molecules have been constructed and expressed in the mutant human B-cell line C1R, which lacks HLA-A and HLA-B antigens, and examined for presentation of a previously defined peptide epitope derived from the influenza matrix protein to appropriate human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lines. When leucine residue 66 in this matrix peptide containing residues 57-68 (matrix peptide 57-68) was replaced by arginine, the resulting matrix peptide 57-68 R66 was not presented to HLA-A2, but the mutation Y116D (tyrosine to aspartic acid at residue 116) in the floor of the peptide binding cleft near its right end dramatically restored peptide presentation. A similar result was obtained by substitution of ornithine for leucine at residue 66. These data provide strong support for a model in which the peptide is orientated with its amino terminus at the left end of the cleft of HLA-A2 and its carboxyl terminus at the right.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper focuses on peptide positioning in HLA-A2 and peptide presentation, not on viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Activity of CD4+ T-cell clones of type 1 and type 2 in generation of influenza virus-specific cytotoxic responses in vitro.
Abstract: The activity of distinct CD4+ T-helper cell (Th) clones in promoting secondary A/PR/8/34/Mt.S.(H1N1) (A/PR8) influenza virus-specific, class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro was examined. CD8+ T cells which had been purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter from spleen cells of A/PR8-primed mice were used as responders. On their own, purified CD8+ T cells were unable to generate cytotoxic activity upon in vitro culture with A/PR8-infected stimulator cells. Significant cytotoxic activity was generated in cultures that were additionally supplemented with A/PR8-specific Th clones or cell-free supernatant from these clones. Although there were large differences among individual Th clones in this function, Th clones of type 1 (Th1) promoted, on average, significantly stronger cytotoxic responses than Th clones of type 2 (Th2). The differences in promotion of a cytotoxic response correlated with the amount of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4 secreted by individual Th clones. These two lymphokines accounted for the CTL-promoting activity of the respective Th clones, since addition of recombinant IL-2 (IL-2) or rIL-4 to Th-free cultures substituted fully for the respective Th clones. As observed with Th clones, rIL-2 was significantly more effective than rIL-4 in promoting a cytotoxic response. When used in combination, Th2 clones had an antagonistic effect on the generation of a CTL response by Th1 clones. This effect could be partially transferred with cell-free supernatant from activated Th2 clones and could be reversed by addition of excess rIL-2. Both consumption of IL-2 by Th2 and secretion of an inhibitory factor(s) appear to be involved in this phenomenon.
Relevant: False

A rabbit antiserum has been raised against HA 128-145 which recognizes not only the free peptide, but also the HA 128-145/DRw11 complex on a solid matrix, in solution, or on the surface of viable cells. The detection of these complexes on viable cells was shown to be class II specific, DRw11 restricted, and commensurate with the level of DRw11 expression. The identity of DRw11 as the cell surface molecule binding HA 128-145 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and tryptic peptide mapping. Using this antiserum HA 128-145/DRw11 complexes could be detected on the cell surface as soon as 30 min after the peptide was added, and increased up to 24 h. Dissociation kinetics showed these complexes were long-lived, with a half-life of approximately 14 h. This anti-HA peptide antiserum represents the first direct means of studying antigenic peptide-human leukocyte antigen class II complexes on the surface of living cells without the addition of a non-amino acid moiety to the peptide. The properties of this antiserum thus provide the potential to study naturally processed antigenic peptides as well as the mechanism of processing itself in a physiologically relevant system.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper describes antibody recognition of HA-HLA class II complexes without linking viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Cell surface transport, oligomerization, and endocytosis of chimeric type II glycoproteins: role of cytoplasmic and anchor domains.
Abstract: We investigated the role of cytoplasmic and anchor domains of type II glycoproteins in intracellular transport, oligomerization, and endocytosis by expressing the wild-type and chimeric genes in mammalian cells. Chimeric genes were constructed by exchanging the DNA segments that encode the cytoplasmic and anchor domains between the human influenza virus (A/WSN/33) neuraminidase (NA) and transferrin receptor (TR). The chimeric proteins in which domains were exchanged precisely were productively targeted to the cell surface. However, the proteins appeared to assemble differently in the intracellular compartment. For example, while TR existed predominantly as a dimer, NATR delta 90, containing the cytoplasmic and signal-anchor domains of NA and the ectodomain of TR, was present as a tetramer, a dimer, and a monomer. Similarly, the influenza virus NA existed predominantly as a tetramer but TRNA delta 35, in which the cytoplasmic and signal-anchor domains of TR were joined to the ectodomain of NA, existed predominantly as a dimer, suggesting that the cytoplasmic and anchor domains of type II glycoproteins affect the subunit assembly of heterologous ectodomains. In addition, we analyzed the role of the cytoplasmic domain in endocytosis. NA and NATR delta 90 did not undergo endocytosis, whereas both TR and TRNA delta 35 were internalized efficiently, demonstrating that the NH2 cytoplasmic domain of TR was capable of internalizing a heterologous ectodomain (NA) from the cell surface.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates intracellular transport and assembly of chimeric glycoproteins, without explicit links between viral genotypes and phenotypes.

Title: Two signals mediate nuclear localization of influenza virus (A/WSN/33) polymerase basic protein 2.
Abstract: Polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), a component of the influenza virus polymerase complex, when expressed alone from cloned cDNA in the absence of other influenza virus proteins, is transported into the nucleus. In this study, we have examined the nuclear translocation signal of PB2 by making deletions and mutations in the PB2 sequence. Our studies showed that two distant regions in the polypeptide sequence were involved in the nuclear translocation of PB2. In one region, four basic residues (K-736 R K R) played a critical role in the nuclear translocation of PB2, since the deletion or mutation of these residues rendered the protein totally cytoplasmic. However, seven residues (M K R K R N S) of this region, including the four basic residues, failed to translocate a cytoplasmic reporter protein into the nucleus, suggesting that these sequences were necessary but not sufficient for nuclear translocation. Deletion of another region (amino acids 449 to 495) resulted in a mutant protein which was cytoplasmic with a perinuclear distribution. This novel phenotype suggests that a perinuclear binding step was involved prior to translocation of PB2 across the nuclear pore and that a signal might be involved in perinuclear binding. Possible involvement of these two signal sequences in the nuclear localization of PB2 is discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies nuclear localization signals of PB2 protein, focusing on protein transport rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Function of two discrete regions is required for nuclear localization of polymerase basic protein 1 of A/WSN/33 influenza virus (H1 N1).
Abstract: Polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) of influenza virus (A/WSN/33), when expressed from cloned cDNA in the absence of other viral proteins, accumulates in the nucleus. We have examined the location and nature of the nuclear localization signal of PB1 by using deletion mutants and chimeric constructions with chicken muscle pyruvate kinase, a cytoplasmic protein. Our studies showed some novel features of the nuclear localization signal of PB1. The signal was present internally within residues 180 to 252 of PB1. Moreover, unlike most nuclear localization signals, it was not a single stretch of contiguous amino acids. Instead, it possessed two discontinuous regions separated by an intervening sequence which could be deleted without affecting its nuclear localization property. On the other hand, deletion of either of the two signal regions rendered the protein cytoplasmic, indicating that the function of both regions is required for nuclear localization and that one region alone is not sufficient. Both of these signal regions contained short stretches of basic residues. Possible ways by which this novel bipartite signal can function in nuclear localization are discussed.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper investigates nuclear localization signals of PB1 protein, focusing on protein transport rather than viral genotype-phenotype links.

Title: Evolution of the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A virus.
Abstract: Nucleotide sequences of 24 nucleoprotein (NP) genes isolated from a wide range of hosts, geographic regions, and influenza A virus serotypes and 18 published NP gene sequences were analyzed to determine evolutionary relationships. The phylogeny of NP genes was determined by a maximum-parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NP genes have evolved into five host-specific lineages, including (i) Equine/Prague/56 (EQPR56), (ii) recent equine strains, (iii) classic swine (H1N1 swine, e.g., A/Swine/Iowa/15/30) and human strains, (iv) gull H13 viruses, and (v) avian strains (including North American, Australian, and Old World subgroups). These NP lineages match the five RNA hybridization groups identified by W. J. Bean (Virology 133:438-442, 1984). Maximum nucleotide differences among the NPs was 18.5%, but maximum amino acid differences reached only 10.8%, reflecting the conservative nature of the NP protein. Evolutionary rates varied among lineages; the human lineage showed the highest rate (2.54 nucleotide changes per year), followed by the Old World avian lineage (2.17 changes per year) and the recent equine lineage (1.22 changes per year). The per-nucleotide rates of human and avian NP gene evolution (1.62 x 10(-3) to 1.39 x 10(-3) changes per year) are lower than that reported for human NS genes (2.0 x 10(-3) changes per year; D. A. Buonagurio, S. Nakada, J. D. Parvin, M. Krystal, P. Palese, and W. M. Fitch, Science 232:980-982, 1986). Of the five NP lineages, the human lineage showed the greatest evolution at the amino acid level; over a period of 50 years, human NPs have accumulated 39 amino acid changes. In contrast, the avian lineage showed remarkable conservatism; over the same period, avian NP proteins changed by 0 to 10 amino acids. The specificity of the H13 NP in gulls and its distinct evolutionary separation from the classic avian lineage suggests that H13 NPs may have a large degree of adaptation to gulls. The presence of avian and human NPs in some swine isolates demonstrates the susceptibility of swine to different virus strains and supports the hypothesis that swine may serve as intermediates for the introduction of avian influenza virus genes into the human virus gene pool. EQPR56 is relatively distantly related to all other NP lineages, which suggests that this NP is rooted closest to the ancestor of all contemporary NPs. On the basis of estimation of evolutionary rates from nucleotide branch distances, current NP lineages are at least 100 years old, and the EQPR56 NP is much older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title: Two nuclear location signals in the influenza virus NS1 nonstructural protein.
Abstract: The NS1 protein of influenza A virus has been shown to enter and accumulate in the nuclei of virus-infected cells independently of any other influenza viral protein. Therefore, the NS1 protein contains within its polypeptide sequence the information that codes for its nuclear localization. To define the nuclear signal of the NS1 protein, a series of recombinant simian virus 40 vectors that express deletion mutants or fusion proteins was constructed. Analysis of the proteins expressed resulted in identification of two regions of the NS1 protein which affect its cellular location. Nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1) contains the stretch of basic amino acids Asp-Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg (codons 34 to 38). This sequence is conserved in all NS1 proteins of influenza A viruses, as well as in that of influenza B viruses. NLS2 is defined within the region between amino acids 203 and 237. This domain is present in the NS1 proteins of most influenza A virus strains. NLS1 and NLS2 contain basic amino acids and are similar to previously defined nuclear signal sequences of other proteins.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper identifies nuclear localization signals in the NS1 protein sequence but does not explicitly link these to phenotypic traits.

Title: Human and bovine coronaviruses recognize sialic acid-containing receptors similar to those of influenza C viruses.
Abstract: Human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus elute from agglutinated chicken erythrocytes when incubated at 37 degrees C, suggesting the presence of a receptor-destroying enzyme. Moreover, bovine coronavirus exhibits an acetylesterase activity in vitro using bovine submaxillary mucin as substrate similar to the enzymatic activity found in influenza C viruses. Furthermore, pretreatment of erythrocytes with either influenza C virus or bovine coronavirus eliminates subsequent binding and agglutination by either coronaviruses or influenza C virus, whereas binding of influenza A virus remains intact. In addition, hemagglutination by coronaviruses can be inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with Arthrobacter ureafaciens or Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase or by addition of sialic acid-containing gangliosides. These results suggest that, like influenza C viruses, human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus recognize O-acetylated sialic acid or a similar derivative as cell receptor.

Reason: The study characterizes receptor recognition similarities between coronaviruses and influenza C viruses but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.

Title: Integration of a small integral membrane protein, M2, of influenza virus into the endoplasmic reticulum: analysis of the internal signal-anchor domain of a protein with an ectoplasmic NH2 terminus.
Abstract: The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a small integral membrane protein of 97 residues that is expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells. M2 has an unusual structure as it lacks a cleavable signal sequence yet contains an ectoplasmic amino-terminal domain of 23 residues, a 19 residue hydrophobic transmembrane spanning segment, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain of 55 residues. Oligonucleotide-mediated deletion mutagenesis was used to construct a series of M2 mutants lacking portions of the hydrophobic segment. Membrane integration of the M2 protein was examined by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNA transcripts prepared using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. After membrane integration, M2 was resistant to alkaline extraction and was converted to an Mr approximately equal to 7,000 membrane-protected fragment after digestion with trypsin. In vitro integration of M2 requires the cotranslational presence of the signal recognition particle. Deletion of as few as two residues from the hydrophobic segment of M2 markedly decreases the efficiency of membrane integration, whereas deletion of six residues completely eliminates integration. M2 proteins containing deletions that eliminate stable membrane anchoring are apparently not recognized by signal recognition particles, as these polypeptides remain sensitive to protease digestion, indicating that in addition they do not have a functional signal sequence. These data thus indicate that the signal sequence that initiates membrane integration of M2 resides within the transmembrane spanning segment of the polypeptide.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes membrane integration of the M2 protein and its signal-anchor domain but does not explicitly link sequence variations to phenotypic changes.

Title: Location on the evolutionary tree of influenza H3 haemagglutinin genes of Japanese strains isolated during 1985-6 season.
Abstract: The nucleotide sequences of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of influenza A (H3N2) isolates from the 1985-6 season in Japan along with those of several viruses isolated between 1982-5 from other countries were analyzed to determine the origin of the 1985-6 Japanese strains. The HA genes of these viruses consisted of 1762 nucleotides and had a three-nucleotide deletion downstream from the stop codon when compared to the sequences of earlier Hong Kong H3N2 viruses. An evolutionary tree of the HA genes of these viruses was drawn using the A/Bangkok/1/79 sequence as the starting point. Eight strains isolated from Asian and Pacific regions including Japan in the 1985-6 season (one in May) had the HA genes located closely on the evolutionary tree but away from those of the isolates in North America and Europe during the 1984-5 season, and a common ancestry for these viruses was suggested.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper analyzes evolutionary relationships of HA genes but does not explicitly link genetic changes to phenotypic traits.

Title: Reconstitution of functional influenza virus envelopes and fusion with membranes and liposomes lacking virus receptors.
Abstract: Reconstituted influenza virus envelopes were obtained following solubilization of intact virions with Triton X-100. Quantitative determination revealed that the hemolytic and fusogenic activities of the envelopes prepared by the present method were close or identical to those expressed by intact virions. Hemolysis as well as virus-membrane fusion occurred only at low pH values, while both activities were negligible at neutral pH values. Fusion of intact virions as well as reconstituted envelopes with erythrocyte membranes--and also with liposomes--was determined by the use of fluorescently labeled viral envelopes and fluorescence dequenching measurements. Fusion with liposomes did not require the presence of specific virus receptors, namely sialoglycolipids. Under hypotonic conditions, influenza virions or their reconstituted envelopes were able to fuse with erythrocyte membranes from which virus receptors had been removed by treatment with neuraminidase and pronase. Inactivated intact virions or reconstituted envelopes, namely, envelopes treated with hydroxylamine or glutaraldehyde or incubated at low pH or 85 degrees C, neither caused hemolysis nor possessed fusogenic activity. Fluorescence dequenching measurements showed that only fusion with liposomes composed of neutral phospholipids and containing cholesterol reflected the viral fusogenic activity needed for infection.

Title: Membrane binding and conformational properties of peptides representing the NH2 terminus of influenza HA-2.
Abstract: Synthetic peptides representing amino acid residues 1-16 and 1-20, a proposed fusogenic region of the HA-2 subunit of influenza virus hemagglutinin, bind to phosphatidylcholine vesicles with submicromolar dissociation constants. The 1-20, but not the 1-16, peptide appears to adopt a helical conformation when bound to vesicles and cooperatively promotes vesicle fusion.

Title: Measurement of the mutation rates of animal viruses: influenza A virus and poliovirus type 1.
Abstract: Epidemiologic and genetic evidence suggests that influenza A viruses evolve more rapidly than other viruses in humans. Although the high mutation rate of the virus is often cited as the cause of the extensive variation, direct measurement of this parameter has not been obtained in vivo. In this study, the rate of mutation in tissue culture for the nonstructural (NS) gene of influenza A virus and for the VP1 gene in poliovirus type 1 was assayed by direct sequence analysis. Each gene was repeatedly sequenced in over 100 viral clones which were descended from a single virion in one plaque generation. A total of 108 NS genes of influenza virus were sequenced, and in the 91,708 nucleotides analyzed, seven point changes were observed. A total of 105 VP1 genes of poliovirus were sequenced, and in the 95,688 nucleotides analyzed, no mutations were observed. We then calculated mutation rates of 1.5 X 10(-5) and less than 2.1 X 10(-6) mutations per nucleotide per infectious cycle for influenza virus and poliovirus, respectively. We suggest that the higher mutation rate of influenza A virus may promote the rapid evolution of this virus in nature.

Title: A primer vector system that allows temperature dependent gene amplification and expression in mammalian cells: regulation of the influenza virus NS1 gene expression.
Abstract: Influenza virus RNA segment 8 has been cloned into primer-vector pSLts1. This vector was designed to replicate in simian cells in a temperature dependent fashion by use of the SV40 tsA209 T-antigen gene. The oriented synthesis of cDNA on dT-tailed pSLts1 was performed on in vitro synthesized mRNA, and the second DNA strand was primed with an influenza-specific terminal oligodeoxynucleotide. Recombinant pSLVa232 contained the RNA segment 8 sequence directly fused to the SV40 late promoter contained in pSLts1, and followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Expression of NS1 gene in transfected COS cells took place at a level comparable to that found in infected cells. When VERO cell cultures were transfected with recombinant pSLVa232, expression of the NS1 gene was temperature dependent. Close to one hundred fold increase in the amplification and expression of the cloned gene was observed after shift down of the transfected cells to permissive temperature. Vector pSLts1 and the cloning strategy described may be useful for the specific cloning and regulated expression of mRNAs of known 5'-terminal sequence.

Title: An efficient method for introducing macromolecules into living cells.
Abstract: The hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus was used to obtain efficient and rapid bulk delivery of antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the cytoplasm of living tissue culture cells. By exploiting HA's efficient cell surface expression, its high affinity for erythrocytes, and its acid-dependent membrane fusion activity, a novel delivery method was developed. The approach is unique in that the mediator of both binding and fusion (the HA) is present on the surfaces of the target cells. A recently developed 3T3 cell line which permanently expresses HA, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza virus, and CV-1 cells infected with a simian virus 40 vector carrying the HA gene were used as recipient cells. Protein-loaded erythrocytes were bound to the HA on the cell surface and a brief drop in pH to 5.0 was used to trigger HA's fusion activity and hence delivery. About 3 to 8 erythrocytes fused per 3T3 and CV-1 cell, respectively, and 75-95% of the cells received IgG or HRP. Quantitative analysis showed that 1.8 X 10(8) molecules of HRP and 1.4 X 10(7) IgG molecules were delivered per CV-1 cell and 6.2 X 10(7) HRP molecules per 3T3 cell. Cell viability, as judged by methionine incorporation into protein and cell growth and division, was not impaired. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that the fused erythrocyte membranes remained as discrete domains in the cell's plasma membrane. The method is simple, reliable, and nonlytic. The ability to simultaneously and rapidly deliver impermeable substances into large numbers of cells will permit biochemical analysis of the fate and effect of a variety of delivered molecules.

Title: The sequence of RNA segment 1 of influenza virus A/NT/60/68 and its comparison with the corresponding segment of strains A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33.
Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA segment 1 of influenza virus A/NT/60/68, corresponding to the PB2 protein, has been determined. It is 2341 nucleotides long, encoding a predicted product of 759 amino acids with a net charge of +27 1/2 at neutral pH. The predicted amino acid sequence has been compared to the equivalent sequences in influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33. Evolutionary divergence, assuming a direct lineage from A/PR/8/34 and allowing for "laboratory drift", is 0.08% per year. The alignment of RNA segment 10 of A/NT/60/68 with segments 1 and 3 is completed, confirming that it is a mosaic of regions from these two segments.

Title: Sequential mutations in the NS genes of influenza virus field strains.
Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequences of the NS genes from three human influenza viruses, A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/FW/1/50 (H1N1), and A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1), were determined. Only five single-base differences were found within the sequences of the A/FW/1/50 and A/USSR/90/77 NS genes, thus confirming earlier data suggesting that the 1977 H1N1 viruses are closely related to virus strains that were circulating around 1950. Comparison of all three sequences with those from A/PR/8/34 and A/Udorn/72 viruses illustrates that these genes (with the exception of that of the A/USSR/90/77 strain) evolve through cumulative base changes along a single common lineage. A nucleotide sequence variation of approximately 2.2 to 3.4% per 10 years was determined for the NS gene segments. Extensive size variation was also observed among the NS1 proteins of the various human viruses. The A/FM/1/47 NS1 protein, which consists of 202 amino acids, is 15% shorter than the A/Udorn/72 NS1 protein, which consists of 237 amino acids.

Title: Complete sequence analyses show that two defective interfering influenza viral RNAs contain a single internal deletion of a polymerase gene.
Abstract: Defective interfering (DI) influenza viral RNAs arise by internal deletion of progenitor RNAs. By using recombinant DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis techniques, we have deduced the complete sequence of two such RNAs (L2b and L3), both arising from the same polymerase (P1) gene of WSN influenza virus. We have also partially determined the sequence of the P1 polymerase gene, including the sequence at the point of deletion and the flanking regions. Our sequence study shows the following. (i) Both L2b and L3 arise by a simple deletion in the P1 gene. (ii) L2b and L3 are 683 and 441 nucleotides long, respectively. (iii) The first 413 and 244 nucleotides of the 5' ends of L2b and L3, respectively, are identical to those of the 5' end of the P1 gene. (iv) The last 270 nucleotides of L2b and 197 nucleotides of L3 are the same as those of the 3' end of the P1 gene. (v) The entire sequence of L3 is present in the sequence of L2b. (vi) Both the 5' and the 3' termini, including the transcription stop and poly(A) addition signals of the progenitor P1 gene, are present in both L2b and L3. (vii) The sequences at the deletion point and the flanking region of the P1 gene do not resemble the consensus splicing sequence of spliced mRNA suggesting that a replicational event rather than splicing is involved in the formation of influenza defective interfering RNAs.

Title: The sequence of the nucleoprotein gene of human influenza A virus, strain A/NT/60/68.
Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A/NT/60/68 was established after using improved cloning methods to obtain full length cDNA clones in pBr322. The gene is 1565 residues long and codes for a basic protein of 498 amino acids. There are only 30 amino acid differences between it and the homologous sequence in A/PR/8/35, all occurring as point mutations. Assuming a common lineage, the evolutionary rate of divergence of the two strains is 0.18% amino acid per year. This confirms there is a slow but significant rate of evolution.

Title: Influenza defective interfering viral RNA is formed by internal deletion of genomic RNA.
Abstract: The 3'- and 5'-terminal nucleotide sequences of the defective interfering (DI) RNAs present in a preparation of DI influenza virus were determined. It was found that all DI RNAs possessed identical terminal sequences for at least the first 13 nucleotides at the 5' end and at least the last 12 nucleotides at the 3' end. The sequence of the DI RNAs is (5')A-G-U-A-G-A-A-A-C-A-A-G-G-...-C-C-U-G-C-U-U-U-C-G-C-U-OH(3'). In addition, the same sequences were present at the 3' and 5' termini of the viral polymerase genes (P1, P2, and P3) from which these DI RNAs originate. These results indicate that DI RNAs of influenzing virus are formed by an internal deletion of the genomic RNA.

Title: Host defense mechanisms against influenza virus: interaction of influenza virus with murine macrophages in vitro.
Abstract: The interaction of mouse macrophages with influenza virus was examined as part of a study into the defense mechanisms against influenza infection. Macrophages exposed to A/Port Chalmers/1/73 virus produced infectious foci on susceptible indicator cell monolayers. Sampling of supernatant fluids and cells from infected macrophage cultures showed release of virus adsorbed to the cell surface. Active virus replication in macrophages could not be demonstrated. Exposing macrophages to specific antibody before or after virus infection resulted in a significant decrease in the number of infectious macrophages. The results suggest that although macrophages are not the source of replicating influenza virus, they are able to spread the infection by having virus attaching to their surface. This activity is interfered with by the presence of specific antibody.
Relevant: False
Reason: The paper studies interaction of influenza virus with macrophages but does not explicitly link viral genotypes to phenotypes.
