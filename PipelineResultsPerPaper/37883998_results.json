The strong association between this mutation and Ser31Asn is also novel; the first time it was detected was in Vietnamese isolates from 2003. Interestingly, all Vietnamese H5N1 viruses isolated in 2004 contained the dual Leu26Ile–Ser31Asn amantadine-resistance mutations ... preliminary in vitro tests on a Hong Kong isolate—A/Chicken/Hong Kong/YU250/03, which contains dual mutations—indicate that this is indeed the case.",

Dual Leu26Ile and Ser31Asn mutations are extremely rare; we found this dual motif in only 1 ... The high incidence of Leu26Ile and its exclusive association with Ser31Asn only in H5N1 isolates from Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia suggest that viruses carrying the dual mutations were stably selected, because no single Leu26Ile or Ser31Asn mutants were found among resistant isolates from these countries. ... Further, it is noteworthy that all available M2 sequences of H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in Vietnam carry the dual Leu26Ile–Ser31Asn mutations.",
